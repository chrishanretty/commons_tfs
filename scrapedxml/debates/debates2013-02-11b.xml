	<p pid="b.549.8/1">Female genital mutilation is an abhorrent form of child abuse which this Government are committed to eradicating. Across Government we have taken a number of actions, including piloting the declaration against female genital mutilation, issuing guidelines to front-line practitioners and providing funding to support communities to tackle FGM themselves. These actions help raise awareness of the issue, change attitudes, strengthen the legal response and support victims.</p>

	<p pid="b.549.9/1">I thank the Home Secretary for that answer. As she knows, most of the data we use in the UK are based on a 2007 study. The Dutch Government recently issued an up-to-date prevalence study, based on methodology developed at a workshop sponsored by the Home Office. When might we look to doing an up-to-date prevalence study here in the UK?</p>

	<p pid="b.549.10/1">My hon. Friend raises an important point, and I would like to pay tribute to the work she has done on this issue, which is respected in all parts of the House. We are assessing a funding application for a prevalence study. The Home Office and the NSPCC co-hosted a recent round-table at which prevalence was discussed, and we are considering various ways in which we can collect the data to inform a more targeted</p>
	<p pid="b.549.10/2">approach to ending this practice. Indeed, the Department of Health is exploring the collection of FGM data in the NHS, including in the maternity and children&#8217;s dataset.</p>

	<p pid="b.550.0/1">One of the best actions we can take to tackle the attitudes that lead to FGM and gender-based violence is to ensure that all our children and young people receive age-appropriate and good-quality sex and relationship education. Has the Home Secretary discussed that with her colleagues in the Department for Education, and will the Government now support compulsory sex and relationship education?</p>

	<p pid="b.550.1/1">The issue of education is discussed in the inter-ministerial group on violence against women and girls, which I chair. It meets regularly and brings Government Departments across the board, including the Department for Education, around the table. It is correct that education and information are very important aspects of dealing with FGM, which is why I am pleased to say that we have delivered 40,000 leaflets and posters to schools, health services, charities and community groups around the country, raising awareness of this issue.</p>

Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison)</phrase> has done on raising awareness of female genital mutilation in the UK? The Home Secretary will be aware of the calls for action to improve awareness of FGM, and to support young people who are facing this threat in coming forward. Given this and her response to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40038" name="Pamela Nash">the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Pamela Nash)</phrase>, may I press her on the question of the level of violence against women and girls in Britain, and ask whether she will give her direct personal support to the One Billion Rising campaign and the vote in this place on Thursday to make sex and relationship education statutory for both boys and girls&#8212;yes or no?</p>

	<p pid="b.550.3/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her comments about my hon. Friend the Member for Battersea. As I said, the Government take this issue extremely seriously and we look across the board at what Government can do to deal with it. It is about helping communities themselves to eradicate this problem. Everyone in this Chamber will be concerned about the lack of prosecutions, and I am pleased that the Director of Public Prosecutions has issued a new action plan on FGM to the prosecutors, with the hope of getting prosecutions. We must recognise that education of a variety of sorts is important, which is why alerting people at various levels in the public services and in schools, and others, and helping girls to understand the threat themselves, is so important.</p>

	<p pid="b.551.2/1">Speculative projections about future inflows cannot be made with any degree of accuracy and are, therefore, not particularly helpful.

	<p pid="b.551.5/1">My constituents think it is madness to open our borders to 29 million people when we have absolutely no idea how many are going to come to this country.

	<p pid="b.551.6/1">My hon. Friend&#8217;s first point about a residency card is something I will listen to and take away with me. On his second point, he may be interested to know that the Metropolitan police and the UK Border Agency been working closely together over the past few months on Operation Nexus, and have removed about 200 very serious and high-harm criminals. That has been very effective, and I hope it will be rolled out across the country in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.551.7/1">Given that the Government cannot produce or are not producing an estimate, and given that the national minimum wage is five to six times higher in this country than it is in Bulgaria or Romania, how confident are the Government that our public services can cope with any surge in immigration, particularly as we got our estimates so badly wrong in 2004?</p>

	<p pid="b.551.8/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. However, it is worth reminding people that even during the whole period of the previous Government, when, as even they have acknowledged, they had no transitional</p>
	<p pid="b.551.8/2">controls for eastern European migration and a significant number came here, four fifths of the net migration was from outside the EU. It is therefore worth seeing things in that context. I go back to the answer I gave to my hon.

	<p pid="b.552.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is worth remembering that eight other European countries, including France and Germany, currently have transitional controls, as we do. They will have to remove those controls at the end of the year, which is partly why making a forecast is so difficult and why the Migration Advisory Committee advised against it.</p>

The Prime Minister is a champion of enlargement, which means the free movement of people, yet the Home Office was considering putting advertisements in the Romanian and Bulgarian press advising people not to come here. There is a simple way of dealing with this matter. First, by working with the Romanian and Bulgarian Governments to find out the cause for people to move here.

He may even occasionally have been the author of some such stories himself. <i>[Interruption.]</i> No, I am not. On his second question about working with our European partners, we will of course work with the Romanian and Bulgarian Governments, as we do on a number of important and serious issues. For example, we work closely with the Bulgarians on combating terrorism. We will continue to take that approach and we will look at ways of making sure that this country is not a soft touch when it comes to benefits and access to public services. The MAC advised against trying to forecast the numbers, because it said that that simply would not be helpful to policy makers.</p>

A number of bodies are involved&#8212;HMRC for the minimum wage, the Gangmasters Licensing Authority and the UK Border Agency.

	<p pid="b.553.0/1">But poor housing from rogue landlords, where they sometimes cram 20 to 30 people into some pretty shabby conditions, is also a major problem and a driver of immigration, particularly from places such as Romania, Bulgaria and other eastern European EU states, so will the Government commit to introducing a statutory national register of private landlords so that we can drive up housing standards in the private sector and drive out some of those crummy conditions?</p>

	<p pid="b.553.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his question. Last Thursday morning, at an unearthly hour, the Minister for Housing and I accompanied UK Border Agency officers and housing officials from the London borough of Ealing on a raid to deal with exactly such landlords with houses in multiple occupation. It was a successful operation and we detained a number of people who had no right to be in the country. Such partnership working between the London borough of Ealing and central Government is working well, and it is the kind of activity that we will continue.</p>

Would it not be a good idea, first, to impose the national minimum wage&#8212;enforce it properly&#8212;so that unscrupulous landlords could not turn people into virtual slaves in this country and, secondly, to double the fine?</p>

	<p pid="b.555.3/1">I will respond to my hon. Friend in relation to the individual case that he has raised, but he starts off by saying that too many decisions by the UK Border Agency are wrong. One of the problems for UKBA is that very often entry clearance officers take decision on the basis of the information in front of them, which may perfectly well be the right decision on the basis of that information, then further information is provided before an appeal is heard. That is an issue that we need to look at.</p>

Although it is no consolation to the family in this case, it might help the House to know that, according to the crime survey for England and Wales, in the year to June 2012 there was a 14% reduction in homicides, a 9% reduction in violent incidents involving knives or sharp instruments, and an 18% reduction in gun crime.

	<p pid="b.561.0/1">This is frustrating for me, because we have explained this policy so painstakingly and carefully, and the concept is so simple, but let me have one more go. We want every council in the country and other relevant agencies to respond straight away whenever problems are brought to their attention. However, it has been brought to our attention, including in a lot of areas with Labour councils, that people keep bringing complaints, particularly lower-level complaints, about individual incidents that do not always warrant immediate attention. We want to ensure that there is some measure of cumulative impact. That is why we have put this measure in place, and it is popular. In the pilot schemes, people are running with it. I commend it to councils around the country, including Labour-run councils.</p>

The Government have got crime down to the lowest point since records began in 1981, so there are fewer crimes to detect. I hope we will carry on and get crime down even further.</p>

Chief Constable Mick Creedon of Derbyshire police has agreed to take on the role, and he brings to the case many years&#8217; experience as a detective. He has also led several major investigations, including police corruption cases and reviews of investigations by other forces, such as the Rhys Jones murder on Merseyside in 2007.

	<p pid="b.564.3/2">I know the whole House will send its sympathy to the family of Frances Andrade, who took her own life after giving evidence against her abusers in court. She was let down by the criminal justice system, whose job it was to help and protect her. It has emerged that Greater Manchester police supported Mrs Andrade getting counselling, but that Surrey police did not. The Surrey police and crime commissioner has said in the last couple of days that</p>
	<p pid="b.564.3/3">&#8220;it&#8217;s the responsibility of the police to present evidence to the court with the victim in a way which is untainted. That means they will not and should not refer a victim for counselling until after they have given their evidence.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.564.3/4">Does the Home Secretary agree that this approach by Surrey police is completely unacceptable, and that victims of sexual abuse should never be denied the support and counselling they need? Will she tell all police forces that they need to make sure that counselling is available, and will she ensure that a proper review takes place of the handling of this entire case, so that lessons can be learned from this dreadful tragedy?</p>

	<p pid="b.565.0/1">I am indeed sure that everybody across the House sends their sympathy and condolences to the family of the lady concerned. This was a terrible case and we all have sympathy with the family for what they have gone through. Improving the way in which the police deal with rape cases has been looked at by Governments over a number of years, because we all recognise the difficulty victims feel in coming forward. Sadly, when we see such incidents I fear that others may be put off, rather than encouraged, from coming forward. We need to look very carefully at what has happened in this case, and very carefully at how we can further improve the system to ensure that victims feel that they will be believed when they come forward and have the confidence to take their case through the courts.</p>

	<p pid="b.565.1/1">I welcome the Home Secretary&#8217;s concern, but I press her to do two specific things in response to this case, the first of which is to tell forces that they need to make sure that counselling is available in these cases. Guidance drawn up in 2002 by the Home Office, Department of Health and Attorney-General states very clearly that</p>
	<p pid="b.565.1/2">&#8220;vulnerable or intimidated witnesses should not be denied the emotional support and counselling they may need both before and after the trial.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.565.1/3">The 2010 guidance from Association of Chief Police Officers and Crown Prosecution Service is similarly clear, yet did not apply in this case and the Surrey police and crime commissioner is saying the opposite. Will she give very clear instruction to forces across the country that they must ensure counselling is available in line with national guidance? Will she also ensure that a proper review takes place of all aspects of this case, so that we learn lessons from this terrible tragedy and ensure that vulnerable victims get the help and support that was denied to Frances Andrade?</p>

	<p pid="b.565.2/1">As I indicated to the right hon. Lady, we will of course look to see what lessons should be learned from this case. She will be aware that the Home Secretary does not instruct police forces to take particular routes. They have operational independence on decisions about how they deal with particular cases. It is important for the guidance to be there, for police forces to be aware of the guidance, and for police forces to operate within the guidance. I will reflect on the right hon. Lady&#8217;s remarks on the attention being given to that guidance. I am sure that all of us across the House want a system in which rape victims feel able to come forward and that we are able to see more prosecutions taking place.</p>

Pope Benedict&#8217;s message on that visit&#8212;of working for the common good&#8212;is something that spoke to our whole country, and I am sure his successor will continue to provide a voice of inspiration for millions around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/2">Last week&#8217;s European Council agreed the overall limit on EU spending for the next seven years, starting in 2014. When these multi-year deals have been agreed in the past, spending has gone up, but last week we agreed that spending should come down. By working with like-minded allies, we delivered a real-terms cut in what Brussels can spend for the first time in history. As the House knows, the EU budget is negotiated annually, so what we were negotiating&#8212;initially at the Council last November and again last week&#8212;was not the individual annual budgets, but rather the overall framework for the next seven years. This includes the overall ceilings on what can be spent&#8212;effectively, the limit on the European Union&#8217;s credit card for the next seven years.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/3">During the last negotiation, which covered the period 2007 to 2013, the last Government agreed to an 8% increase in the payments ceiling, to &#8364;943 billion. Put simply, this gave the EU a credit card with a higher limit, and today we are still living with the results of allowing the EU&#8217;s big spenders to push for more and more spending each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/4">In fact, only last year, while member states were having to make tough decisions to tighten their belts at home, the big spenders succeeded in increasing the 2012 European budget by another 5% compared with the previous year. If no deal had been reached, the existing ceilings would have been rolled over and annual budgets could have continued to soar for the next seven years. Because annual budgets are negotiated by qualified majority voting, it can be difficult to constrain spending in these annual negotiations. By contrast, the seven-year limits are agreed by unanimity, so this was our chance to get the ceilings down in line with what could be afforded.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/5">The European Commission produced an initial proposal for increasing the payments ceiling still further to &#8364;988 billion. This was strongly supported by a number of member states. The first negotiation took place at the Council in November, and although the President did then reduce this during the Council itself, it was still some way short of the real-terms cut we were looking for. So together with like-minded allies from a number of countries, including Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark, we rejected the deal on the table and told them to think again.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/6">At this Council, we made further progress. Together with allies, many of whom like Britain write the cheques, we achieved a proper look across all the areas where spending in the Commission proposal could be cut. While there are areas where we could and should go further, not least on reforming the common agricultural</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/7">policy and reducing the bureaucratic costs of the European Commission, we agreed a real-terms cut in the payment limit to &#8364;908 billion. That is &#8364;80 billion lower than the original proposal; &#8364;35 billion lower than the deal agreed by the last Government, which is still in operation today; and &#8364;60 billion lower than the emergency arrangements that would have come into place if there were no seven-year deal. My aim was not simply to cut the credit-card limit; I wanted to set the limit at a level that would deliver at worst a freeze and at best a cut in actual spending over the next seven years. That is what this deal delivers&#8212;a real-terms cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/8">If we take the latest complete budget&#8212;the one for 2012&#8212;and freeze spending at that level for the next seven years, we would have spending limits of &#8364;932 billion. Our new payments limit means spending cannot rise above &#8364;908 billion, so we have slashed &#8364;24 billion off a real freeze on the last completed budget. Of course, the budget set in 2012, which Britain voted against, was unacceptably large, but even against the average of the last two completed years&#8212;2011 and 2012&#8212;this deal still delivers a real-terms cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/9">This deal must now, of course, be voted on by the European Parliament, and the European Council has said it is prepared to accept some flexibilities about how spending is divided between different budget years and different areas of spending, but we are absolutely clear that this must be within the framework that the member states have now agreed. The EU&#8217;s seven-year budget will now cost less than 1% of Europe&#8217;s gross national income for the first time in its history.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/10">Let me say a word about how this deal is likely to affect the UK&#8217;s contribution; a word about how it is likely to affect what the UK receives from the EU for research, for our regions and for our farmers; and a word about what this means for growth and competitiveness across the European Union as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.569.1/11">On the UK&#8217;s contribution, the House will remember how the last Government gave away almost half of our rebate. This has had a long-term and continuing effect on the UK&#8217;s net contributions. It is worth remembering why. It is because when the European Union spends money on structural funds and cohesion payments in eastern European countries, for example, the UK no longer gets a rebate on this money. As a result, almost whatever budget deal was done, our net contributions were always likely to go up. As a result of this deal, however, they will be going up by less. The only two sensible things we could do to protect the British taxpayer in these negotiations were to get the overall budget down and to protect what is left of our rebate.</p>

	<p pid="b.570.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman keeps on saying &#8220;Hear, hear&#8221;, but he was the one who gave away our rebate in the first place. Even he is welcome on a happy day like today. That is exactly what we have done.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.1/2">While the actual amount that the UK contributes will depend on technical factors, such as the size of the annual budgets, economic performance and exchange rates, as a result of this deal we now expect the UK&#8217;s contribution to the EU to fall as a share of our gross national income. As for the rebate that this Government</p>
	<p pid="b.570.1/3">inherited, it is now completely untouched. As ever, throughout the negotiations the rebate was attacked repeatedly, but I successfully rejected all the calls for change, and under this Government the British rebate is safe.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.1/4">In terms of what the UK receives, I wanted to make sure that our universities were well placed to receive research work, that our less well-off regions were treated fairly compared with others, and that our farmers continued to receive support for the environment schemes that they put in place. Let me deal with each of those points.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.1/5">The section of the budget that includes spending on research, innovation and university funding is up by over a third. The money is handed out on the basis of quality, so Britain&#8217;s universities are particularly well placed to benefit. We have ensured that structural funds will continue to flow to our less well-off regions, and Britain&#8217;s share will remain broadly the same, at around &#8364;11 billion. While we have cut spending on the common agricultural policy overall, we have protected the flexibility that will allow us to direct funds to support both the environment and the livelihoods of</p>
	<p pid="b.570.1/6">our farming communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.1/7">Overall, this is a better-framed budget in terms of growth, jobs and competitiveness. It is disappointing that administrative costs are still around 6% of the total, but overall spending on the CAP will fall by 13% compared with the last seven-year budget. Research and development, and other pro-growth investment, will now account for 13% rather than 9% of the total budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.570.1/8">Reform of EU spending is a long-term project, but this deal delivers important progress. Working with allies, we took real steps towards reform in the European Union. This is a good deal for Britain, a good deal for Europe, and above all a good deal for all our taxpayers. That is what we have delivered, and I commend my statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.571.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement. Let me first join him in paying tribute to Pope Benedict XVI. He is a spiritual leader for 2 billion people in the world, and a theologian of great distinction. His visit to the United Kingdom will be long remembered as a proud moment for millions of Catholics in this country, many people of other faiths, and, indeed, many Members of the House. His decision to stand down will not have been reached lightly, and it is right for Members in all parts of the House to acknowledge his service.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/2">I also join the Prime Minister in welcoming the agreement that has been reached on a cut in the seven-year payment ceilings for the European Union budget. At a time when so many budgets were being cut at home, the House voted for a real-terms cut last October, and it was right to do so. No doubt it was just an oversight that in his statement he forgot to express his thanks to Members on his own Benches and on those of the Opposition for giving him such a strong negotiating mandate. Even he must see the irony of his having sought to vote down a proposal that turned out to be the outcome of the negotiations. He was against it before he was for it: that is the reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/3">As well as restraint in the budget, however, we needed reform. We needed to prioritise growth within a smaller budget by cutting back even further on spending that was not a priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/4">Let me deal first with agriculture. The common agricultural policy fell as a proportion of the budget from 46% in 1997 to 33% in 2010. We welcome the modest continued decline in agriculture spending as a share of the European budget from 31% in 2013 to 27% by 2020, but does the Prime Minister agree that with agriculture making up just 1.5% per cent of the total output of the European Union and still accounting for nearly 30% of the budget, there is still much more to do?</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/5">Secondly, we welcome the increase in funds targeted towards growth, infrastructure, research and development and innovation, but can the Prime Minister confirm that the achievement of a declining budget compared to November&#8217;s proposal came not at the expense of agricultural spending but, in part, at the expense of that funding for growth?</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/6">Thirdly, the Prime Minister and I agree on the need for the EU to play its part in effective development, diplomatic and governance support in north Africa. Can he say what discussions took place about how the EU could play that enhanced role in the context of the decision in this budget round to effectively freeze the European development fund, which provides assistance for the region? Given the new emerging challenges across the Sahel, what information can he give us about how funding for that region will be affected? In that context, can he take this opportunity to say something about the transition road map for Mali, which formed part of the Council&#8217;s conclusions, or at least part of its discussions?</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/7">Fourthly, given the very significant and unprecedented difference between the ceiling on payments&#8212;to which the Prime Minister referred in his statement&#8212;and the ceiling on commitments agreed on Friday, can he tell the House what discussions took place about how this would be dealt with in the years ahead?</p>
	<p pid="b.571.0/8">While this budget brings restraint, Europe still needs a plan for recovery and growth. The Council&#8217;s conclusions talk about the importance of trade agreements. Will the Prime Minister update the House on developments on the possible EU-US trade agreement and on how he sees that being developed this year, including at the G8 summit? Does he recognise, however, that the long-term changes to the budget and the possible EU-US trade agreement are no substitute for a growth strategy for Europe? There are 26 million people looking for work in the European Union, and nearly 6 million unemployed young people looking for work&#8212;shamefully, 1 million of them here in the UK. The European economy is struggling and the British economy is flatlining. What Europe now needs, and what Britain now needs, is a plan for jobs and growth. That is the way Europe must change, that is the change that we need for Britain, and that must be the priority for the months and years ahead.</p>

	<p pid="b.572.0/1">I suppose we should take the welcome. We should take it from someone who never got a freeze, let alone a cut, who never protected our rebate but who gave it away, and who told us that we were going to be marginalised, isolated and picking</p>
	<p pid="b.572.0/2">fights in an empty room. But I welcome the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s welcome. Thank you. I did not quite get a thank you, but I will give him a thank you for the non-thank you.</p>
	<p pid="b.572.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman asked a lot of questions. Let me go through them. On agriculture, he asked whether there was more to do on reducing the budget, given that it represented only 1% of European industry. Yes, there is, although we have taken some steps forward. The common agricultural policy budget pillar one goes from &#8364;320 billion to &#8364;277 billion, which is a significant change. In terms of what grew in the budget that can help to deliver growth and jobs, we have the Connecting Europe Facility, which is about energy, transport and broadband networks. That goes from &#8364;8 billion in the last seven-year period to &#8364;19 billion in this period, so I do not think it is entirely fair to say that the right things were not increased or that the right things were not cut. I said in my statement that I was disappointed that we did not go further on the central bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.572.0/4">We did have a discussion on north Africa and Mali. The right hon. Gentleman is wrong to say that the European development fund will go down; it will go up by &#8364;1 billion. On Mali, there was very little time left at the end of the marathon Council to discuss those issues, but I took the opportunity to praise the French President for the brave action that the French have taken, to offer our strong support, and to say that we would contribute by training troops from west African nations. I have spoken to the Nigerian President, who is in London today, about that issue. Most of all, however, a political strategy is needed alongside the military efforts.</p>
	<p pid="b.572.0/5">On the gap between ceilings and payments, the gap is between &#8364;960 billion on commitments and &#8364;908.4 billion on payments. That is just over 5%, which is not untypical, given the experience of recent years. The European Commission thought that that gap was deliverable, so I think that answers that question. On EU-US trade, I spoke to President Obama about half an hour ago, and I think we are making progress. I will continue strongly to push and support that measure. On the issue of how we use the European Union to encourage growth, one of the greatest things we can do is to complete the single market in digital, in energy and in services, and it is this Government, working with allies, who are delivering precisely that.</p>
	<p pid="b.572.0/6">On the overall deal, there is a real need to ensure that the European Parliament supports it. We are often challenged about the friends we have in Europe, but I would challenge the right hon. Gentleman about his friends there. What is he going to say to his friends in the Party of European Socialists who are condemning this deal, condemning the British action and saying that we should not be constraining European spending? Will he confirm today that Labour MEPs will be voting for this budget? Answer? The head moved a little bit. While he is at it, is it not time to confirm whether his party will back an in/out referendum? Labour&#8217;s claim is that the greatest problem is uncertainty, but what could be more uncertain than not knowing whether you are for it or against it? Any progress? It is not a day for answers, but it is a day for celebrating the fact that we have cut the budget for the first time in history.</p>

	<p pid="b.573.0/1">The Prime Minister has been successful in winning the most important reform of the EU budget since Margaret Thatcher in</p>
	<p pid="b.573.0/2">Fontainebleau in 1984. Does my right hon. Friend agree that his achievement, and the success last week of a most acceptable reform of the common fisheries policy, demonstrates how many of the United Kingdom&#8217;s objectives can be achieved by serious and professional negotiation with our allies? Does he accept also that our objectives&#8212;for example, the working time directive&#8212;can be achieved, as he did with the EU budget and as the United Kingdom did with the CFP, by working with the close allies we have on so many of these subjects?</p>

	<p pid="b.574.0/1">I agree with my right hon. and learned Friend, and it is worth paying tribute to Baroness Thatcher, because what makes the British rebate different from the other rebates is that it does not have to be renewed in each seven-year term: it is there as part of the architecture of the budget, and unless you are foolish enough to give some of it away, which the last Government did, it is there and can only be amended by unanimity.</p>
	<p pid="b.574.0/2">I agree with what my right hon. and learned Friend says about working with allies, but I would also say this, which is relevant to what Margaret Thatcher achieved at Fontainebleau: everyone in the European Union has got to understand that you are prepared to say no if you do not get what you want.</p>

	<p pid="b.574.1/1">In welcoming the progress that was made, may I ask the Prime Minister about further efforts to cut the administrative costs of the European Union? He will be aware that, even in Germany, the high cost of salaries and the benefits that officials enjoy is now a matter of great public controversy. What progress does he think could be made on this budget to ensure that those who work for the European Commission are paid a reasonable salary and not one that offends European taxpayers?</p>

	<p pid="b.574.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is right to raise this. The Commission proposal&#8212;heading 5, on EU bureaucracy&#8212;was &#8364;63 billion over the seven-year-period. That was cut back to &#8364;61.6 billion, but it is disappointing. Looking at levels of pay, levels of benefit and some of the special payments that people receive, there is a range of reforms that could be made. We must go on arguing for them in the annual budget process and go on working with allies. I think it is now understood across Europe that there are generosities that simply are not defendable.</p>

All the UK MEPs account for a decent percentage of the European Parliament, so it makes a real difference if socialist MEPs and Liberal MEPs from Britain vote for this budget, and they should do so in an open, transparent manner. The idea of having a secret ballot in a Parliament seems to me completely wrong.

Gentleman&#8217;s party, in government, passed. Having said that, and given that we have to try to ensure that there is a deal, and it is better to have a deal than no deal, it is right to say to the Parliament, &#8220;It is important you can look at flexibilities between different years&#8212;between different budget headings&#8212;to try to ensure that spending is planned properly,&#8221; but I was very specific, and it was very specifically said at the Council, that this flexibility cannot result in the &#8364;908.4 billion ceiling being increased. That cannot go up. Money can be moved around to plan spending more effectively, although, of course, all that has to come back to the Council to be agreed, but the &#8364;908.4 billion, in my view, is inviolable.</p>

Britain is prepared to contribute some 200 troops to that purpose. I spoke this morning to President Goodluck Jonathan of Nigeria to offer our support to train Nigerian troops. It is our intention and that of the French that those west African troops will replace the French troops. Then two things need to happen&#8212;a political agreement in Mali that helps to bring that country together, and the rapid training of Malian forces so that they can take responsibility for their own security.

As I said, the best way to protect our net position which makes sense is to keep the rebate and keep the overall level of spending down. I absolutely agree with my hon.

We are better off outside it, but we have to understand the fact that, for some European leaders and politicians, the euro is an article of faith and they will do everything they can to save their currency.

Over the last MFF, there was something like a 7% gap, on average, between commitments and payments, so I would argue that a 5% gap is perfectly safe. I think that what we will see is lots of efforts by the institutions of the European Union, now that they are on a tighter budget, to try to spend their money more effectively and to try to use the headroom available. That is perfectly understandable and it might lead to better financial planning, but we can be confident that the ceilings are fixed and that, as a result, the spending will be less.</p>

	<p pid="b.584.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. It is important that we continue the work of shrinking the agriculture part of the budget and growing the part of the budget that goes towards research and development and investment, because we want a modern European economy that can win in the global race.</p>

	<p pid="b.584.2/1">In 2011, the Prime Minister vetoed the EU treaty. Earlier this year, he made the Bloomberg declaration, promising an in/out referendum. Last Friday, he forced the EU to cut the budget. Is he not proving that he is a traditional Tory? Surely this statesman is not the heir to Blair, but the heir to Thatcher.</p>

	<p pid="b.584.4/1">I congratulate the Prime Minister on a double first last week: the first real-terms cut to the budget and the first time that the overall budget has been less than 1% of GDP. That gives the lie, does it not, to the accusations of the Labour party that Britain has been isolated in Europe ever since he used the veto just over a year ago? Is it not a combination of the red lines that he has drawn, the negotiating strategy and the building of alliances that has led to this successful outcome?</p>

As with the fiscal treaty, it is important that if we cannot accept something and do not want to accept something, we are prepared to say no. It is also vital to build alliances.

It is important that other European leaders recognise that when we sit round that table, we listen not to the European Parliament, which has its legitimate views, but to our own Parliaments. That goes for the British Parliament and also for the German, Swedish, Dutch and Danish Parliaments. All Parliaments of the net contributors must be listened to.</p>

Margaret Thatcher got a fantastic deal, and the fact about the rebate is that it lasts through all MFF periods, rather than having to be renewed on every occasion.</p>

	<p pid="b.585.5/1">The people of this country waited nearly four decades for a British leader strong enough to promise them a say on the European juggernaut and to stop the budget from growing, so may I congratulate the Prime Minister on delivering both in nearly three weeks? I particularly welcome the shift of resources to research and development, which will do the economy and Britain a world of good. <i>Le Figaro </i>has described the Prime Minister as a tenacious negotiator, fuelled, no doubt, by Haribo and other great British exports.

	<p pid="b.589.1/1">I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for his steadfast support. The difficulty in answering his question directly is that until we have the exact breakdowns of spending on agriculture, structural funds and cohesion in each year, it is difficult to work out exactly how much the rebate will deliver. The rebate does not operate on the cohesion spending in eastern Europe, but it does operate on agriculture spending. It is only when we know those parameters that we can work out the position. I have been straightforward and said that the British contribution is likely to go up because of the changes to the rebate agreed by the previous Government. However, they will go up by less than they would have done, because we have constrained the budget and because we have kept the rest of the rebate intact.</p>

That is desperately unfair, particularly for those who have worked hard all their lives to pay off their mortgage, save for their future or have something to pass on to their loved ones, only to see their property sold and their savings wiped out. This is something that happens to more than 30,000 people every year or 100 people every day.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/3">The system we have also sends out the wrong message: that people are better off not saving for their future because any savings may only disappear in a puff of smoke. So today I can announce the Government&#8217;s radical plans to transform the funding of care and support in England&#8212;bringing a new degree of certainty, fairness and peace of mind to the costs of old age, disability and living with long-term conditions, while ensuring that the greatest level of financial support goes to those with the greatest need. We propose to introduce a cap on an individual&#8217;s financial contributions towards the cost of care and a significant increase in the level of assets a person may hold and still receive some degree of support from the state.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/4">In 2010, this Government asked economist Andrew Dilnot to look at the whole issue of funding for care and support. The independent Dilnot commission published its recommendations in July 2011. In response to those recommendations and following extensive engagement with the care and support sector, we published the care and support White Paper and the progress report on funding reform in July 2012. In the progress report, we accepted some of Andrew Dilnot&#8217;s main recommendations, including those for a consistent, nationally set eligibility threshold for care and support, and universal deferred payments, whereby no one will have to sell their home in their lifetime to pay for care costs. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Andrew and his team for their excellent work.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/5">A core principle set out by the Dilnot commission was that people should contribute to the costs of their own care, but those costs should be limited and protected against the potentially catastrophic costs of care. That should come through a cap on those costs and an extended means test. One person in 10 will be faced with care costs in excess of &#163;100,000, with a small number facing costs significantly higher still. To give everyone peace of mind, from April 2017, we will introduce a cap on the amount that someone over state pension age will be liable to pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/6">The Dilnot commission&#8217;s original suggestion was for a cap of &#163;25,000 to &#163;50,000 in 2010-11 prices&#8212;the equivalent of &#163;30,000 to &#163;61,000 in April 2017 prices. Despite the extremely challenging economic situation</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/7">in which we find ourselves, we have come as close to that range as possible. The cap will be set at &#163;61,000 in 2010-11 prices or &#163;75,000 once it is introduced in April 2017.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/8">The intention is not that people should have to pay up to &#163;75,000 for their care costs, but that by creating the certainty that this is the maximum they will have to pay, they can then make provision through insurance or pension products so that they are covered up to the value of the cap, thereby reducing the risk of selling their home or losing an inheritance that they have worked hard to pass on to their family. Young people who already have care needs when they turn 18 will now receive free adult care and support when they reach 18. People who develop a care need after 18 but before state pension age will be protected by a cap that is below the &#163;75,000 threshold.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/9">The other measure we propose is to increase significantly the amount of assets a person can hold and still receive financial support for their residential care home costs. Currently, this is set at &#163;23,250. If a person has assets valued above this level, including in some circumstances the value of their home, they receive no support. The Dilnot commission recommended this threshold be raised dramatically to &#163;100,000 in 2010-11 prices. We accept this recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/10">From April 2017, the threshold will be increased so that those with assets worth &#163;123,000 or less, equivalent to Dilnot&#8217;s recommended level, will all receive some degree of financial support for their care costs. People with the fewest assets will receive the most support. This will, for the first time, provide financial protection for those with modest wealth, while ensuring that the poorest continue to have all or the majority of their costs paid.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/11">Everyone will benefit from the peace of mind that a cap will bring. The introduction of a cap and the extended means-tested support will help many people in the most challenging circumstances. We expect up to 16% of older people who need care to face costs of &#163;75,000 or more&#8212;but, of course, none of us knows whether we will be in that 16%. Everyone will benefit from the peace of mind that these changes will bring, and by 2025 up to 100,000 more older people will receive financial support with their care costs as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/12">The Chancellor and the Treasury have rightly insisted that we identify how we pay for the additional costs of these proposals. In this day and age, making promises that cannot be paid for makes those promises meaningless &#8212;so we have identified exactly how to pay for them. These reforms will cost the Exchequer &#163;1 billion a year by the end of the next Parliament. With the agreement of the Chancellor, these will be met in part by freezing the inheritance tax threshold at &#163;325,000 for a further three years from 2015-16. The Chancellor and the Chief Secretary have agreed that the remaining costs over the course of the next Parliament will be met from public and private sector employer national insurance contributions revenue associated with the end of contracting out as part of the introduction of the single-tier pension.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/13">These two new proposals join others previously announced when we published the draft care and support White Paper last summer, and they include from 2015 the ability of people to defer the payment of residential care costs so that no one need sell their own home to pay for them during their lifetime. Also from 2015, a</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/14">national minimum eligibility threshold will be introduced to end the lottery of local access that can see support provided to someone in one area, but not in another. Taken together, today&#8217;s proposals and those already set out in the draft Care and Support Bill represent a new era of support for the elderly and disabled in England. Thanks to the certainty these proposals introduce, rather than people feeling they have to hoard every penny in case the very worst should happen, or that they are powerless and there is no point in saving at all, people will be able to plan and prepare sensibly for the future. They will be supported by a wider range of financial products becoming available in the market, which will be designed to help people to plan and prepare for their later years and to reassure them about how much they will pay. We will work with the care and support sector&#8212;with local authorities, charities, care providers and individuals&#8212;and with the financial services industry to develop the plans and introduce them practically.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/15">Our society is ageing. By 2030, the number of people over 85 will double, and the number of people with dementia will exceed 1 million. As the number of older people with such long-term conditions increases, we need to become a society in which people prepare and plan for their social care costs as much as they prepare and plan for their pensions. Sadly, that is an issue that Governments of all colours have long failed to tackle.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/16">While many other things need to be done to prepare for an ageing population, these reforms herald an historic change in the way in which care and support are funded. The economic circumstances are challenging, but these commitments demonstrate our determination to help people who have worked hard, saved, and done the right thing to prepare for the uncertain hand that fate deals all of us in old age. Because we are introducing these reforms within the time scale and at the thresholds set out, they will also be sustainable and consistent with our overriding priority, which is to reduce the deficit inherited from the last Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/17">We want our country to be one of the best places in the world in which to grow old. These plans will give certainty and peace of mind in regard to the cost of care, ensuring that we can all have the support that we need without facing unlimited costs, while also ensuring that the most support goes to those in the greatest need.</p>
	<p pid="b.592.1/18">I commend my statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-11b.594.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40361" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="594"  time="016:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#130211-0002.htm_spnew11">
	<p pid="b.594.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for his statement, and for early sight of it. I agree with him that our current social care system in England is the worst of all possible worlds: a cruel lottery whereby people go into later life with everything for which they have worked on the roulette table, and the most vulnerable are always the biggest losers. That needs to change.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/2">The Secretary of State has tabled a modest plan that will make the system fairer than it is today, and we congratulate him on that. We welcome elements of what he has announced today. A cap of &#163;75,000 will protect people from the catastrophic costs of care, and raising the means-test threshold will help more people on lower incomes to obtain some help with care charges. This is a step forward, but it is a faltering one. The House has been presented with a flawed prospectus today. Vulnerable people will still face rising care charges</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/3">and homes will still be lost, notwithstanding valiant attempts to put the best possible spin on things in the weekend media. Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister made the big claim that the Government were going to &#8220;crack&#8221; the care &#8220;conundrum&#8221;. Today, when we are faced with this meek package, that sounds suspiciously like overselling. Stephen Burke, the director of United for All Ages, has described the cap as</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/4">&#8220;the dampest of damp squibs&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/5">Yesterday, on The Andrew Marr Show, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/6">&#8220;I've been hauled before the Speaker before and I wouldn&#8217;t want that to happen again and so I don&#8217;t want to go into the details.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/7">Now that we have heard the details, perhaps the Secretary of State could explain on which part of his statement the media had not been pre-briefed. It is disappointing that the media rather than the House were briefed first on a statement that was of such importance to so many people. It is also disappointing that the Government have abandoned any effort to build a cross-party consensus before rushing to announce its proposals, and that they have chosen to rewrite the Dilnot report with figures of its own, breaking its careful logic.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/8">More specifically, there are four problems with what has been announced today, and I will address each in turn. First, it fails the fairness test. We will only have a durable solution if it can answer this question: will it help every person and every couple to protect what they have worked for, whatever their wealth and savings? I am afraid that the answer is no. According to Demos, a &#163;35,000 cap would benefit about 3.2 million pensioners. A per-person cap of &#163;75,000 will benefit just 1.4 million. For the average couple, the cap is &#163;150,000. That might be enough to protect detached houses, but it will not protect the average semi-detached home in large parts of England.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/9">As Andrew Dilnot said today, the cap</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/10">&#8220;is higher than we would have wanted &#8212;&#163;11,000 higher than the top end of our range&#8212;and I regret that&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/11">Will the Secretary of State confirm that people with modest to average homes and savings are not protected under his plan? Is this not a plan for the few and not the many, and further proof that we are not all in it together?</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/12">The Secretary of State claims that insurance companies will step in with new products to help more people to protect their assets, but in evidence to the Health Committee, the Association of British Insurers said that it did not believe that the capped cost model would result in a market for pre-funded care insurance. So what further confidence can the Secretary of State give the House today that such a market will in fact emerge?</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/13">Secondly, the plan is at best a partial solution. With this decision, the Government have prioritised the funding of a cap on care costs with new money, over and above addressing the crisis in council care budgets. Will the Secretary of State confirm that this was against the advice of Andrew Dilnot to the cross-party talks? In practice, it will mean that vulnerable people will continue to face rising charges, as councils put up fees to cope with the growing shortfall in their budgets, making it more likely that those people will, in time, have to pay right up to the new &#163;75,000 cap. To many people, that will not feel like progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/14">More than &#163;1.3 billion has been cut from local council budgets for older people&#8217;s care since the coalition came to power. Care charges are rising above inflation, and councils are warning that, by 2024, they will be overwhelmed by the costs of care. Does the Secretary of State accept that forecast, and if he does, how will the plans he has announced today help to address it? If he fails to face up to the current crisis in council funding, is it not the case that, with care charges rising, today&#8217;s announcement will feel like a con? It is true that the Government have raised the capital threshold, and I have said that we welcome that, but can the Secretary of State give the House any confidence that the extra support that people receive through a more generous means test will not be more than offset by increasing care charges caused by collapsing council budgets?</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/15">What people might not know is that the cap reflects not what people actually pay for care but a local authority average, and that it does not include accommodation costs. That was not mentioned in the Secretary of State&#8217;s statement. Will not people feel conned if the Government do not make that clearer?</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/16">The third problem is that this package disguises yet another coalition U-turn, this time on inheritance tax&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It is ironic, I must say. In 2007, a flagship pledge was made to increase the inheritance tax threshold to &#163;1 million. Just eight weeks ago, the Chancellor said that he would increase the threshold in two years&#8217; time. What has happened in the past two months to make him change his mind? Is not this the quickest coalition U-turn yet? The irony will not be lost on people that the Government are now increasing death taxes to pay for their plan. The Secretary of State has also said the rest will be made up from national insurance. Does he think it is fair to ask the working age population to pay for something else, rather than older people?</p>
	<p pid="b.594.0/17">Finally, the proposal fails to meet the scale of the challenge of the ageing society. It will not lead to more integration of care. Instead, it will entrench the separation between two separate systems: a free-at-the-point-of-use NHS and charged-for social care. Would it not have made more sense, rather than developing these piecemeal plans in isolation, to have set them out as part of a single vision for a sustainable health and care system in the 21st century? The Secretary of State has made progress, but he has missed an opportunity to produce a long-term plan that is fair to everyone and built on cross-party consensus. He has settled for a timid solution when what older people needed was a far bigger and bolder response.</p>

	<p pid="b.596.0/1">Really! The right hon. Gentleman talked about a flawed prospectus, but what we had from the Labour Government during their 13 years in power was no prospectus whatever. This was in Labour&#8217;s manifesto in 1997, then the Government had a royal commission in 1999. There was a Green Paper in 2005, followed by the Wanless review in 2006. The problem was going to be solved in the comprehensive spending review of 2007, but then we had another Green Paper in 2009. Let us compare that with a coalition that commissioned a report the moment it came into office, said after a year that it accepted the principles of the report, and has now, just two years later, announced how it will implement it and pay for that implementation.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/2">Let me go through some of the things that the shadow Secretary of State has said. He quoted one stakeholder,</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/3">Stephen Burke, but let us look at what some of the others have been saying. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has said that</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/4">&#8220;the cap and threshold are welcome measures, and a welcome sign that the government is taking responsibility for addressing care funding.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/5">Andrew Dilnot said today:</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/6">&#8220;I recognise the public finances are in a pretty tricky state and it doesn&#8217;t seem to me that&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/7">what the Government are proposing is&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/8">&#8220;so different from what we wanted&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/9">Or we could talk about Age UK, which says it</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/10">&#8220;has always supported the principle of a cap&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/11">and welcomes the fact that we are increasing what it describes as</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/12">&#8220;the current miserly upper means test threshold&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/13">A lot of stakeholders welcome today&#8217;s announcement, but recognise that we are in extremely difficult financial circumstances and that that is why we have to be responsible with public finances.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/14">The right hon. Gentleman talked about the cap of &#163;75,000, which is indeed higher than the upper limit proposed by Andrew Dilnot, but to describe this as only helping people on higher incomes is fundamentally to misunderstand how a cap works. First, potentially more than 70% of the &#163;1 billion a year that this will cost the Government by the end of the next Parliament is going to socially disadvantaged families. This is a highly progressive measure, and as well as increasing the cap we are increasing the threshold above which people do not get any help, from &#163;23,000 to &#163;123,000&#8212;exactly the kind of thing that some of the most disadvantaged families on the lowest of incomes will benefit from most.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/15">The right hon. Gentleman talks about the Association of British Insurers&#8212;he needs to get up to date. It describes this as</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/16">&#8220;potentially another positive step forward in tackling the challenges of an ageing society.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/17"><i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> If he wants some more quotes, let us look at what financial services companies are saying. Aegon UK says it</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/18">&#8220;welcomes today&#8217;s announcement and the clarity it brings on state support.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/19">Legal &amp; General says it is</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/20">&#8220;pleased the Government has decided to move forward with Andrew Dilnot&#8217;s proposals.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/21">As for local authority budgets&#8212;the shocking state of which, by the way, we inherited from the last Labour Government&#8212;the Government said in the spending review that the NHS health budget would give &#163;7.2 billion of support for health-related needs to local authorities during the course of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/22">On inheritance tax, what the right hon. Gentleman does not understand about today&#8217;s measures is that fundamentally, they are helping people to protect their inheritance from the lottery of social care costs. The randomness of someone not knowing whether they will be the one in 10 who suffers over &#163;100,000 in care costs is eliminated by a proposal that allows everyone to plan and prepare for their own social care costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/23">The right hon. Gentleman describes this as a modest plan and says we have neglected the scale of the problem. Of course, in dealing with an ageing population many other issues need to be dealt with. He talked about the problem of integration, which we are solving by devolving</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/24">power to clinical commissioning groups on the front line, a reform that Labour opposed, and by integrating technology, a reform on which Labour failed. Also, Labour did nothing about dementia, leaving us with less than half the people with dementia being diagnosed. We are now tackling that problem. We saw last week the issues of treating older people with dignity and respect. We are tackling that problem&#8212;Labour left it for far too long.</p>
	<p pid="b.596.0/25">The problem is not that our solution is too small, but that it was too big for Labour to solve when they were in office. When it comes to making Britain a better country to grow old in, this Government are taking action where the last Government failed.</p>

Does he further agree with me that when our right hon. Friend the Leader of the House was Health Secretary, he set up the Dilnot commission within weeks of this Government taking office, and that the package my right hon.

My right hon. Friend is also right about the fundamental randomness and unfairness. Of course, we are not saying that the Government will pay for all the social care costs we encounter&#8212;public finances could not possibly be in a state to allow that to happen.

In our inquiry into social care, we on the Select Committee on Health were told that this country has no market at all in long-term care insurance&#8212;not only that, but no country in the world has a working market in pre-funded long-term care insurance.

	<p pid="b.599.0/1">I am afraid that what the hon. Lady says sums up the attitude of the Opposition; they thought it was wishful thinking to try to solve this problem, whereas we are getting on with a solution. We do not have those financial products available at the moment, but the whole point of these structures is that we will help to create a market in which it is possible to have them. The point of the cap is to allow the hon.

First, children who reach adulthood&#8212; the age of 18&#8212;with care costs will continue to receive the support they need without any qualification at all. Adults who become disabled during their working life will have a cap, but it will be a lower one. So we will be able to offer very important support to both those groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.600.4/1">The Alzheimer&#8217;s Society has said today that capping care costs is a step in the right direction, but a &#163;75,000 cap is so high that it will help only the few. The Secretary of State knows that there are 800,000 people in this country living with dementia now, and his announcement today, however welcome it is, does not deal with the community care costs that those people face day to day. This costs a billion pounds in, but there is &#163;1.3 billion out of community costs to local authorities. How will he fill that gap?</p>

	<p pid="b.600.5/1">The right hon. Lady knows well the challenge and the crisis that we face because of dementia, and she has spoken movingly on the issue. What I would say about what the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society is saying is that to look at the cap in isolation is to misunderstand these proposals. For many people with dementia, the most significant thing will be the increase from &#163;23,000 to &#163;123,000 in the threshold at which they get state support. That is a big step forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.600.5/2">The cap is not saying that we expect people to pay &#163;75,000 towards their care costs. We are saying that that is the maximum anyone will have to pay, which makes it possible for people to make provision in their pensions and in insurance policies. One in three of us will get dementia, and we do not know whether we will be among those one in three. This proposal will allow people to put some certainty in place&#8212;to make plans now, which means that when they are dealing with the nightmare of either themselves or someone in their family having to cope with dementia, they will not have the double whammy of having to worry about losing their house as well.</p>

Is the Secretary of State aware that this approach has helped to reduce substantially the number of people requiring long-term hospital beds, has also helped to reduce NHS bed-blocking, and has enabled thousands of elderly, frail people in Scotland to live in their own homes, rather than face the crippling costs of moving into residential care?</p>

	Horsemeat (Food Fraud)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-11b.608.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40444" speakername="Owen Paterson" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs"  colnum="608"  time="017:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0002.htm#130211-0002.htm_spmin13">
	<p pid="b.608.1/1">I would like to update the House on recent developments with regard to horsemeat and food fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/2">The events that we have seen unfold over the past few days in the UK and Europe are completely unacceptable. Consumers need to be confident that food is what it says on the label. It is outrageous that consumers have been buying products labelled beef, which turn out to contain horsemeat. The Government are taking urgent action with the independent Food Standards Agency, the industry and our European partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/3">Let me turn first to the facts. On <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-15">15 January</phrase>, the FSA was notified by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland of the results of its survey of processed beef products on the Irish market. The Irish study identified trace amounts of horse and pig DNA in the majority of the sample, but identified one product, a Tesco burger, where there was evidence of flagrant adulteration with horsemeat. The investigations in Ireland are ongoing.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-16">16 January</phrase>, in order to investigate the implications for the UK market, the FSA announced a four-point plan. That included telling implicated food businesses to test their processed beef products and the launch of a full scientific study of processed beef products on the UK market.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/5">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-31">31 January</phrase>, the Prison Service of England and Wales notified the Food Standards Agency that traces of pork DNA had been found in a selection of meat pies labelled as halal. Although trace contamination does not necessarily indicate fraudulent activity, any contamination is clearly of concern to faith communities. The affected products were quarantined and the contracts suspended.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-04">4 February</phrase>, the FSA announced that it had tested a consignment of frozen meat that was being stored at Freeza Meats in Northern Ireland for horse DNA. That consignment had been detained by the local authority in October 2012 because of labelling irregularities. The consignment is under the secure control of the local authority. None of the consignment has entered the food chain and so no recall is necessary. As part of the investigation, Newry and Mourne local authority has tested current products from Freeza Meats and neither horse nor pig DNA has been found in any of those products. The FSA is undertaking a detailed investigation, which includes following the supply chain of Freeza Meats and any other producers that are implicated.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/7">On the evening of <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-06">6 February</phrase>, Findus informed the Food Standards Agency that it had confirmation of horsemeat in frozen beef lasagne products. The lasagne were produced in Luxembourg by a French company, Comigel, with the meat supplied by another French company, Spanghero. The test results were supplied to the FSA on the morning of <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-07">7 February</phrase>. The FSA is investigating the case urgently in liaison with the French authorities and the police. The FSA has assured me that it currently has no evidence to suggest that the products recalled by Findus represent a food safety risk. The <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-07">7 February</phrase> announcement that very significant amounts of horsemeat had been found in Findus lasagne moved the issue from one of trace contamination to one of either gross negligence or criminality.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-08">8 February</phrase>, Aldi withdrew two beef products after its tests found that they contained horsemeat. The products were supplied by Comigel, the same company that supplied Findus. Asda and Tesco also withdrew products from the same suppliers on a precautionary basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/9">Food regulation is an area of European competence. Under the European legal framework, main responsibility for the safety and authenticity of food lies with those who produce, sell or provide it to the customer. In the UK, the Food Standards Agency was set up by the previous Government as an independent agency, and I have sought to respect its independence. It leads the operational response, and I am today updating the House on progress with its investigations and on the action I have been taking with the industry and European counterparts. I have made clear my expectation that food businesses do whatever is necessary to provide assurances to consumers that their products are what they say they are.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/10">The Minister of State and the FSA met food retailers and suppliers on <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-04">4 February</phrase> and made it clear that we expect the food industry to publish results of its own testing of meat products to provide a clearer public picture of standards in the food chain. In response to the Findus announcement of <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-07">7 February</phrase>, the FSA asked in addition that all producers and retailers test all their processed beef products for the presence of horsemeat. On <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-09">Saturday 9 February</phrase> I called in the major food retailers, manufacturers and distributors to make clear my expectation that they verify and trace the source of all their processed beef products without delay.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/11">At that meeting with the British Retail Consortium, the Food and Drink Federation, the British Meat Processors Association, the Federation of Wholesale Distributors, the Institute of Grocery Distribution and individual retailers, I made it clear that I expected to see from them the following: meaningful results from testing by the end of this week; more testing of products for horse along the supply chain and that the industry co-operates fully with the FSA on that; publication of industry test results every three months through the FSA; and that they let the FSA know as soon as they become aware of a potential problem in their products. I made it very clear that there must be openness and transparency in the system for the benefit of consumers, and that retailers and processors must deliver on those commitments to reassure their customers.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/12">Let me reiterate: immediate testing of products will be done across the supply chain, including suppliers to schools, hospitals and prisons as well as retailers. The FSA issued advice to public service providers on <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-11">Sunday 11 February</phrase> in advance of the working week. I also reiterate that the FSA has assured me that it currently has no evidence to suggest that recalled products represent a food safety risk. The chief medical officer&#8217;s advice is that even if bute is found to be present at low levels, there is a very low risk that it would cause any harm to health. People who have bought Findus beef lasagne products are advised not to eat them and return them to the shop they bought them from as a precaution.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/13">The ultimate source of these incidents is still being investigated, but it is already clear that we are dealing with Europe-wide supply networks. I am taking action to ensure effective liaison with the European Commission and other member states, and I have been in touch with</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/14">Irish Minister Simon Coveney on several occasions since <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-28">28 January</phrase>. I have spoken to him twice again today and have also spoken to European Commissioner Borg, the French Minister St&#233;phane Le Foll and Romanian Minister Daniel Constantin. I emphasised the need for rapid and effective action, and I am grateful for the good co-operation there has already been.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/15">I have agreed with Minister Coveney that there will be an urgent meeting with Commissioner Borg of Ministers from the member states affected. In addition we agreed that this issue will be on the agenda of the Agriculture Council on <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-25">25 February</phrase>. At the moment this appears to be an issue of fraud and mislabelling, but if anything suggests the need for changes to surveillance and enforcement in the UK we will not hesitate to make those changes. Once we have established the full facts of the current incidents and identified where enforcement action can be taken, we will want to look at the lessons to be learned from this episode. I will make a further statement about that in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.1/16">In conclusion, I want to reiterate that I completely understand why people are so concerned about this issue. It is unacceptable that they have been deceived in this way. There appears to have been criminal activity in an attempt to defraud the consumer. The prime responsibility for dealing with this lies with retailers and food producers who need to demonstrate that they have taken all necessary actions to ensure the integrity of the food chain in this country. I am in daily contact with the FSA. This week I will be having further contact with European counterparts and I will be meeting the food industry again, together with the FSA, tomorrow. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.610.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for an advance copy of his statement. Four weeks ago, the Irish authorities alerted the UK Government that they had discovered horsemeat in burgers stocked by UK supermarkets, including Tesco, Iceland and Lidl. Last Monday, we discovered that meat labelled as halal and served in UK prisons had tested positive for pig DNA. On Thursday, the scandal spread from frozen burgers to frozen ready meals, as we discovered that Findus beef lasagne contained up to 100% horsemeat. On Friday, this incompetent Secretary of State and his food Minister went home&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.610.1/1">Order. Everybody wants to make their contribution, and the only way they will is by being a little quieter. People may not like what is being said, but they should at least have the courtesy to listen.</p>

	<p pid="b.610.2/1">On Friday, No. 10 told the press that the Secretary of State was working hard at his desk, getting a grip on this crisis. But in fact he had to be called back to London from his long weekend&#8212;crisis, what crisis? Until Saturday&#8217;s panic summit, he had not actually met the food industry to address this crisis. The food Minister had met with the food industry just once, exactly a week ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/2">On Friday, I received information that three British companies were involved, potentially, in importing beef that actually contained horse. I wrote to the Secretary of State, offering to share the information with him.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/3">I also handed it to the Serious Organised Crime Agency. On Friday, the FSA said that the police were involved, so I was reassured. However, on Friday night the Met police said that they had had talks with the FSA, but that there was no live criminal investigation. On Saturday, after a conversation with one of the food industry representatives, I realised that the Secretary of State had not revealed the names of those firms to the food industry at the meeting. Why not? If the Government want the food industry to test on the basis of risk, why did the Secretary of State not share the names of those companies at Saturday&#8217;s meeting?</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/4">On Thursday, DEFRA announced its statutory testing regime, with 28 local councils purchasing and testing eight samples each. Does the Secretary of State seriously expect people to wait 10 weeks for the results? Can he confirm that that will be the first survey of product content that his Department has carried out since his Government removed compositional labelling from the Food Standards Agency in 2010? He talks about the FSA&#8217;s operational independence, but it is not responsible for the content of our food&#8212;he is. When will he stop hiding behind civil servants and take some responsibility? Does he think that surveying just 224 products from across the country matches the scale of this scandal, when he has asked the supermarkets to test thousands of their products by Friday? Can he confirm today to the House that not all of those thousands of tests will be completed by Friday?</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/5">Can the Secretary of State tell the House how many products the large public sector catering suppliers will test and how many lines the members of the British Meat Processors Association will test? In his letter to me last Friday, he stated that some members of the British Hospitality Association and the British Retail Consortium have withdrawn products as a precaution. Can he tell the House which members have withdrawn which products, and whether any of them supplies schools, prisons and hospitals? The supermarkets have acted with speed and a degree of transparency on this that puts him to shame. I am disappointed that the hospitality industry and caterers have not been as candid.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/6">In his letter to me, the Secretary of State said that the FSA is taking up individual suspicious incidents with authorities and the police across Europe. He said in the media this weekend that there is an international criminal conspiracy at work. Does he think that international criminals are present everywhere in Europe apart from in the United Kingdom? The French Government estimate that the Findus fraud alone has netted criminals &#8364;300,000. This is clearly big criminal business. Why have the UK police not investigated on the basis of the intelligence supplied? Has he had the full results of the tests carried out by the Irish authorities?</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/7">At Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions nearly three weeks ago, I asked the food Minister about horses contaminated with bute slaughtered in the UK and entering the human food chain. It has now been confirmed that of the nine UK horses that tested positive for bute, one was stopped, five went to France, two to the Netherlands and one to the UK. However, when council officials approached the people who had supposedly taken the horse to eat it, they had no knowledge of what had happened to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/8">There has been talk of an EU import ban, but has the Secretary of State considered the possibility that horses are going to UK and Irish abattoirs and entering the food chain in the UK? Which horse abattoirs in the UK are on the FSA&#8217;s cause for concern list? Have any horses presented for slaughter in the past month been rejected by officials because of concerns over their passports? If so, where and how many?</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/9">The Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has clear evidence of illegal trade in unfit horse from Ireland to the UK for meat, with horses being re-passported to meet demand for horsemeat in mainland Europe. It says that there are currently 70,000 horses unaccounted for in Northern Ireland. Unwanted horses are being sold for &#8364;10 and sold on for meat for &#8364;500&#8212;a lucrative trade. It is convenient to blame the Poles and Romanians, but so far neither country has found any problems with its beef abattoirs.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/10">When will the Secretary of State get his story straight on bute? This horse medicine is banned from the food chain for a reason. On Friday, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/11">&#8220;I would have no hesitation at all in eating these products.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/12">Yet on Sunday he said that this food could be injurious to human health. The Health Secretary said it is just a labelling issue. Is this not symptomatic of the Government&#8217;s dangerous complacency?</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/13">I note the chief medical officer&#8217;s advice to people this morning. What levels of bute have to be present in the meat for it to be a human health risk? Will the Secretary of State tell us what the safe limits of bute consumption for human beings are, given that it is banned from the human food chain? The British public must have confidence that the food they buy is correctly labelled, legal and safe. When Ministers came to the Commons to answer my urgent question on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-17">17 January</phrase>, the food Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/14">&#8220;It is important that neither the hon. Lady nor anyone else in this House talks down the British food industry.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2013-01-17.1027"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 January 2013; Vol. 556, c. 1027</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/15">These invisible regulatory services protect our consumers and our food industry, and allow it to export all over the world. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I think Government Members would do well to listen as this issue is of interest to their constituents and the lack of information from their Government has been nothing short of a disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/16">This weekend consumer confidence in British food was sinking like a stone. Food is a &#163;12 billion industry that supports hundreds of thousands of UK jobs and exports. In common with No. 10, it is rapidly losing faith in this Secretary of State&#8217;s ability to lead them through this crisis.</p>

	<p pid="b.612.0/1">You would not think that we had inherited Labour&#8217;s system would you, Mr Deputy Speaker? You really wouldn&#8217;t. I always admire the hon. Lady&#8212;she really has a nerve.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/2">This issue is a European competence. As agreed by her Government, the independent Food Standards Agency was set up and we have followed their policy of respecting that independence. Today, I talked to its chairman, Lord Rooker, whom she knows well, and he agreed that we had respected its independence. In the early stages of this history, this was an issue of trace DNA in an Irish abattoir. Once it came to the Findus case, where there was a significant volume of horse material, it took on</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/3">a whole new dimension. He agreed that it was then appropriate that the Secretary of State should become publicly involved, as I have been in recent days. The hon. Lady is critical of the FSA&#8217;s survey&#8212;on which I wish it well. I raised it with the noble Lord this afternoon, and he agreed that April was the intended end date for these results, but that he could possibly publish some of them as he works through.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/4">The hon. Lady completely misses the point that the retailers are responsible for the quality and content of their food. That is laid down in European law. Her Government passed a statutory instrument in 2002. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> There is no point in the hon. Lady shouting. She must understand that under the current arrangements it is for retailers to decide. She has completely missed the point that they are responsible for testing, they are responsible for the integrity of their food and they are responsible to their customers. They have a massive self-interest in this, because obviously they want their customers to come back. She will be pleased to hear that we had a most satisfactory meeting on Saturday, and they will be bringing forward meaningful results by the end of this week.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/5">The hon. Lady went on a bit about the police. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I agree with my hon. Friends that she went on and on about the police. This is a serious issue, and the FSA has raised it with the Metropolitan police, but the hon. Lady must understand that until there is a criminal action in this country, they cannot take action. However, the FSA has been in touch with Europol, because it does look as though there have been criminal cases on the continent.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/6">The hon. Lady mentioned the Irish test. I have had a conversation this afternoon with Minister Coveney. We have agreed that there will be protocol between our two independent agencies to agree testing equivalents and to work extremely closely together, because our two food industries so often work in co-operation on either side of the Irish sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/7">The hon. Lady mentioned horses. Today, Lord Rooker will announce that further to our recent announcement that all horses slaughtered in this country will be tested for bute, no carcase will be released until it has been proven positive.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/8">Finally, the advice on food is very simple. I have been completely consistent. It must have been in an interview and I think she mis-heard the second part of a sentence when I was speaking. I have been absolutely clear. The independent agency that gives professional advice is the Food Standards Agency. I, the hon. Lady, hon. Members and the public should follow its advice. As long as products are free for sale and have not been recommended for withdrawal by the FSA, they are safe for human consumption. I recommend that she follows the advice of the independent agency that her Government set up.</p>

	<p pid="b.613.0/1">Is it not absolutely right that this is a European problem that requires a European solution? This contaminated meat should never have entered the UK food chain.

	<p pid="b.614.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, the Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, for her question. Commissioner Borg made it clear to me today that there were no grounds for banning imports on mislabelling or fraud, and that that could happen only if human safety might be imperilled. I have also spoken to Minister Constantin in Romania, who was very emphatic on this point&#8212;we have to be fair to all countries involved. He made it quite clear to me&#8212;I am happy to share this with the House&#8212;that the two main named abattoirs, one of which only deals with horsemeat, shipped products that were correctly labelled. Horsemeat was shipped and it was labelled as horsemeat. I therefore think that this case has some distance further to travel, and we should not jump to conclusions, which is why I am pleased that my discussions with Minister Coveney have led to an agreement that the Agriculture Ministers of the half dozen countries concerned will meet. We all want to get to the bottom of this.</p>

	<p pid="b.614.1/1">The Secretary of State says that there is no evidence of criminal activity in this country, but may I remind him that inaccurate labelling is illegal? Why has it taken him more than three weeks to summon the retailers and four weeks to come to the House?

	<p pid="b.614.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that inaccurate labelling is an offence. At the moment, we have to establish exactly what is in these materials and who is responsible for the label. In the Findus case, that material has been withdrawn.</p>

	<p pid="b.614.3/1">We have the red tractor and other farm assurance schemes that guarantee that meat from those sources is guaranteed through to processed product. May I urge the Secretary of State to urge people to eat that type of meat, which is completely traceable? Finally, Europe has been far too lax on this type of meat processing for many years, so we need a tightening up across the whole of Europe in order to know exactly what we are eating.</p>

The ultimate arbiters when it comes to the safety, quality and integrity of food products are the retailers. The hon.

Too much is taken for granted under the present system. Too often, although the paperwork is supposed to describe what is on the pallet or the truck, it goes through the system and no one actually checks. I think that we could make a massive improvement within the current constraints of European competence and all the other arrangements, but I think that random testing would make a real difference. I am pleased that Lord Rooker was so sympathetic to that idea today, as was Commissioner Borg.</p>

	<p pid="b.628.6/1">It is a pleasure to move amendment 1, and to consider amendments 2 and 3 with it. As hon. Members who are following the Bill closely will realise, the substance of the amendments lies in amendment 3, which proposes to leave out paragraph (b) of clause 1(2). That would have the effect of making the Bill apply only to subsections (1) and (2)(a). It would no longer include any reference to</p>
	<p pid="b.628.6/2">&#8220;the draft decision to establish a Multiannual Framework for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights for 2013-2017 (document number 10449/12).&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.628.6/3">On Second Reading, the Minister expressed the view that we would be able to go into the issue of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights in more detail in Committee, and the amendment gives us the opportunity to do just that. I want to reassert the concern that I expressed last week on Second Reading that, although this Government and this country were always against having such an agency, we are tremendously relaxed about extending its budget and its range of activities now that it has been established. There must come a time when we say to the European Union, &#8220;Enough is enough. You have gone too far already and we want to rein back the range of activities of the Agency for Fundamental Rights in the coming five-year period.&#8221; I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some words of encouragement on the action that our Government are taking to rein back the activities of the agency and, in particular, to prevent it from encroaching on the competences and activities of the Council of Europe, which covers 47 member countries, including the 27 members of the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="b.628.7/1">Will my hon. Friend tell the House exactly what this Agency for Fundamental Rights does? As I understand it, its job is to collect and give evidence on data regarding fundamental rights in all the EU countries. Given that we are all already signed up to the European convention on human rights&#8212;much against my will, but there we are&#8212;which apparently has nothing to do with the European Union, can he explain why on earth we need this body in the first place?</p>

	<p pid="b.629.0/1">The Government at the time had grave reservations about this being included in the provisions of the Lisbon treaty, for the very reason to which my hon. Friend refers&#8212;namely, that it represented a duplication of activity that was already taking place.It was an attempt to set up in the European Union a duplicate body to the European Court of Human Rights and the European convention on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.629.0/2">My hon. Friend asks what the agency does. It was intended to try to create what was called a fundamental rights culture within the European Union, and to that end, the organisation does an enormous amount of research. It holds conferences, one of which I have attended. As I said on Second Reading, it was more a propaganda exercise than anything else. The agency produces large tomes of documentation relating to what it describes as fundamental rights in different countries in the European Union. However, it is clear from everything that it does that its ultimate agenda is to be not an advisory body but a legislative body. I hope that the Minister will be able to reassure us that the Government realise that that is the agenda, that they have seen through it, and that they are vigorously opposing it, given that it involves the duplication of so many activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.629.2/1">In essence, the Agency for Fundamental Rights tries to deal with collective rights, rather than individual rights, whereas the European Court of Human Rights deals with individual rights. That is a moot point, however. As with so many things, the European Union comes along and confuses the issue by giving a new institution a very similar name to that of an existing body. We have a Council of Europe, and, although we do not have a council of the European Union, we have a European Union Council. We also have a Commission of the European Union. The European Union has stolen the flag that was originally the flag of the Council of Europe. It has even stolen the anthem of the Council of Europe, and it is now intent on stealing the main part of the Council of Europe&#8217;s activities&#8212;namely, looking after human rights under the European convention on human rights.</p>

	<p pid="b.629.3/1">This is part of a creeping sickness, is it not? The European Union is trying to claim rights over trans-frontier broadcasting so that it can tell the whole of Europe what we may and may not broadcast. Upstairs, the House heard this afternoon that the European Union is trying to take over the European Space Agency, which of course goes much wider than the European Union; and now we have this, this evening. Where does my hon. Friend think this might stop?</p>

	<p pid="b.629.4/1">I know my hon. Friend has been doing very valuable work in scrutinising trans-frontier broadcasting &#8212;he is, I believe, a rapporteur on that subject for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.629.4/2">Trans-frontier broadcasting exemplifies the problem we have. The Council of Europe set up a convention on trans-frontier broadcasting which has been signed up to not just by its 47 member countries, but by a lot of other countries as well; it is a very important convention. However, the European Union has come along and said that the convention cannot be brought up to date because it cuts across a fundamental competence of the Union. Therefore, the Council of Europe has been prevented, amazingly, from updating the convention because the European Union has said it cannot do so. Of course, because the Union has 27 of the 47 member countries of the Council, if it says, &#8220;You cant&#8217; do that&#8221;, the Council&#8217;s member states collectively have no option but to obey the Union. This is an example, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40447" name="Roger Gale">the Member for North Thanet (Sir Roger Gale)</phrase> rightly says, of the European Union&#8217;s plan to encroach further upon the territory and responsibilities of the Council of Europe, to the extent that ultimately, it wishes to take over the whole organisation. That is what is so sinister about this measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.629.4/3">If this were for free, we could all be relatively relaxed about it and deal with it as an academic abstraction, but it is costing us serious money: some &#8364;83 million at the moment, as we heard on Second Reading. The Agency for Fundamental Rights was set up fewer than 10 years ago with a budget of virtually nothing; now, it already has accrued that amount of expenditure, and the plans for 2013-17 are to expand it much further.</p>
	<p pid="b.629.4/4">As we heard in my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister&#8217;s brilliant statement today, he and colleagues in the European Union are saying, &#8220;Enough is enough: we&#8217;ve got to rein back on the European Union&#8217;s expansionist programme&#8221;. When people put forward the challenge, &#8220;What are we going to rein back?&#8221;, my view is that this is a good starting point. We never wanted this in the first place, and I hope we are going to hear from the Government what we are doing to push back in the opposite direction.</p>

	<p pid="b.630.0/1">I am somewhat concerned about this issue myself, but I want such rights to be strengthened, rather than weakened. However, I will come to that in my speech. Does the hon. Gentleman not agree that some fundamental rights ought to apply to workers and trade unions taking strike action&#8212;for example, that we should determine those nationally, rather than internationally?</p>

	<p pid="b.630.1/1">I am absolutely in favour of our having control over these issues as a sovereign country, which is why I do not really buy into the concept that there is some standard of fundamental rights across the whole of Europe. Now, the European Union is trying to identify and interpret common factors across all member countries&#8212;the Council of Europe is probably as guilty of this&#8212;and then impose them on all the countries through the agency, the Council of Europe or the European Court of Human Rights. These are very serious issues, and I look forward to hearing in due course where the hon. Gentleman thinks the agency should go.</p>
	<p pid="b.630.1/2">The agency was only set up as a compromise to provide something based in Vienna. The Austrians had said that they did not have a European Union agency there, and, the agency having duly been set up, the Austrians are in the forefront of wanting to give it more powers, responsibilities and money, so that more Eurocrats</p>
	<p pid="b.630.1/3">can be based in Vienna and contribute to the Austrian economy. That is the cynical way these things develop. It was a compromise deal, and we have now seen that this organisation has a life of its own. I hope that Ministers will say they are going to snuff this out before the end of the 2017 multi-annual framework. That is why I have great pleasure in moving amendment 1, but if the issue comes to a vote, I will seek a vote on amendment 3, which is where the substance lies.</p>

	<p pid="b.631.0/1">I am very concerned about this issue because before my time in Parliament, I was involved in the trade union movement, in which I have a strong interest, and my feeling is that the agency and fundamental rights in the European Union are a bit of a paper tiger when it comes to defending workers&#8217; rights. As I said when I intervened, I want fundamental rights to be strengthened. Whether they are strengthened by legislation in this Parliament or at the European Union level is a matter for debate, but they certainly need to be strengthened. The rights of trade unionists were weakened considerably by previous Conservative Governments and they have not been restored to anything like my satisfaction.</p>
	<p pid="b.631.0/2">The &#8220;paper tiger&#8221; nature of fundamental rights in the European Union was shown in the Viking Line case. Industrial action was taken and, strangely, the fundamental right to take strike action was overridden in favour of the interests of employers. Profits and the rights of employers were seen to have primacy over the fundamental rights of trade unionists. So, I am not impressed by the fundamental rights guaranteed by the European Union. If they are fundamental, the trade unionists taking that action should have been found to be in the right, and the European Court of Justice should not have ruled against them, finding in favour of employers. There have been two such cases, major cases, and they have shaken the confidence considerably of many trade unionists who mistakenly put their faith in the European Union to defend their rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.631.0/3">I was never impressed with the European Union. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> knows, I am a critic from a left-wing, rather than right-wing, point of view. I was never as confident as perhaps some of my colleagues were that the European Union would defend trade union and worker rights. I will not necessarily be voting with the hon. Gentleman on this issue&#8212;if a vote is indeed called&#8212;but I do want the fundamental rights of workers and trade unionists strongly supported and defended, be that in the European Union or in the United Kingdom.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-11b.631.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40198" speakername="Chris Heaton-Harris" colnum="631"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0003.htm#130211-0003.htm_spnew11">
	<p pid="b.631.1/1">It is a pleasure to speak in this debate, and I want to talk about the agency in general terms. I am very concerned about the growth in the number of agencies at European level: the European &#8220;quangocracy&#8221;, as many call it. As a Member of the European Parliament, I sat on the Committee on Budgetary Control, whose purview extended to the agencies when we approved their accounts or gave them a statement of assurance each year. People always moan about the risk of fraud, mismanagement and maladministration in the European Commission, but it was fairly obvious that the further away from the Commission&#8212;from the centre&#8212;agencies were, the less the scrutiny of their accounts.</p>
	<p pid="b.631.1/2">My concern is that giving the Fundamental Rights Agency a multi-annual financial framework and such a big budget increase could lead to issues with the way it runs its accounts. I am not saying it had issues in the past&#8212;actually, it did have one&#8212;but we are talking about a massive expansion in its budget. It is an arm&#8217;s length body that has very little oversight from the European Commission, the European Parliament or national Governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.631.1/3">Over the years, the European Court of Auditors has sporadically looked at projects run by the agency. It is fair to say that they have been of mixed value. They have certainly improved over time, as one would expect, but I understand why concerns are being raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase>, among others, about including an agency whose work obviously duplicates other bits of work going on within the European Commission, the Council of Europe and possibly in other places.</p>
	<p pid="b.631.1/4">We are talking about quite a lot of money here. The Prime Minister made a good point in his statement when he said that, in these times of austerity, we should expect the European institutions to act appropriately. I am not trying to undermine the work that the Fundamental Rights Agency does, but I hope that the Minister will talk about the value for money it gives. The reports from the European Court of Auditors on the agency&#8217;s spending regularly show that it has come in under budget and has been transferring moneys from different parts of its budget into either staffing or buildings and rent over the past few years&#8212;in European terms, that is a good way of coming in slightly under budget rather than having a big surplus. So giving the agency such a huge amount of money in a multi-annual financial framework deserves questioning and deserves our having a proper debate on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.631.1/5">I understand where my hon. Friend is coming from in trying to remove reference to the agency from this Bill, because perhaps it is time we had a proper look at one of the agencies of the European Union. In the two and a half years I have been here, I have not seen this place carry out oversight into the agencies in any sort of way, and we should do our job for UK taxpayers, who will be funding this agency come what may. If the Minister would say a few words on how the agency has spent its money and on his hopes for how it will spend the money that we will give it in the future, I would very much appreciate hearing them.</p>

Bizarrely, we face enacting something and, in doing so, supporting a wholly unnecessary agency. It is unnecessary because, as my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch said, it does the work that the Council of Europe already does. We are already signed up to the European convention on human rights, which is bad enough&#8212;if I had my way, we would not be signed up to that&#8212;but now it appears that the Government want us to have an EU version of exactly the same thing.</p>

	<p pid="b.633.1/1">I rise to speak because I am shocked by what the hon. Gentleman has just said. The European convention on human rights came about at the initiative of the British Government in the beginning; it was done to bring people together to find ways of applying common standards across the whole of Europe in order to prevent what had happened leading up to the catastrophe of the second world war. Surely he is not saying that he thinks the UK would have been better off not having taken that initiative and that Europe should remain a place of conflict where people do not agree on what human rights everyone deserves in Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.633.2/1">I know that the hon. Gentleman takes a pride in living in the past, and that is fine and dandy, but of course he was talking about what the convention was set up to do in the first place, many years ago, whereas I am talking about the present. I am sure that he did not envisage our having to have ridiculous things such a votes for prisoners as a result of our membership of the European convention on human rights. I do not want to get sidetracked on to something that is not, strictly speaking, dealt with in this group of amendments, Mr Evans. The hon. Gentleman was tempting me down a path that I fear you might have intervened on had I pursued it any further. My point is that whether we are in the convention rightly or wrongly, we are in it and so it is utterly pointless to have the agency trying to mimic what is already being done there.</p>
	<p pid="b.633.2/2">My second point relates to the agency&#8217;s desirability. Even if it was not pointless, it would certainly be undesirable. Let me give hon. Members an example of the types of issues the agency is trying to interfere in. It had a speaker on a panel discussing:</p>
	<p pid="b.633.2/3">&#8220;Guaranteeing access to healthcare for undocumented migrants in Europe&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.633.2/4">We now have a new term&#8212;undocumented migrants. I think my constituents know them as illegal immigrants, but in the politically correct-speak of the EU they are undocumented migrants these days. Of course what</p>
	<p pid="b.633.2/5">the agency is trying to do is encourage all these illegal immigrants to access health care in countries such as the UK. My constituents are sick to the back teeth of the national health service being used by illegal immigrants and rather prefer these people to go back to the country that they should be in to access the health care in the country they come from. I hope that the Minister will address the following question: are the Government really using taxpayers&#8217; money to fund an agency within the European Union that is actively encouraging people from within the EU illegally&#8212;this discussion was on illegal immigrants&#8212;to access this country and use the services provided for people in this country? It would be a ridiculous state of affairs if it was the official policy of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government to use taxpayers&#8217; money to fund an agency to give out that kind of advice. If the Government&#8217;s policy is that they do not like this particular organisation and do not approve of what is it doing, what on earth are we doing with this Bill? Why are we being encouraged, in effect, to allow taxpayers&#8217; money to be spent this agency?</p>

	<p pid="b.634.0/1">I am sure that my hon. Friend will not welcome this information, but this all goes wider that what he has described, because what is often being suggested is that these people seeking to access health care should be able to do so without disclosing their own identities.</p>

If we are in this situation because the Minister is utterly powerless to do anything about it because he has no influence whatsoever, I hope he will admit that.

	<p pid="b.634.3/1">My right hon. Friend, as ever, is absolutely right. We certainly need no lectures from other countries in the EU about how to protect people&#8217;s freedoms; this country has a far better track record than member states of the EU will ever have. I suspect that the Minister will be trying to defend the indefensible, but it is a sad state of affairs when it appears that we in this House are powerless to do anything about these sorts of bureaucracies. We all know what happens with these types of bureaucracies: they grow and grow, and they empire build. They will grow their influence and they will try to do things that they are not supposed to do&#8212;things they were not set up to do. They will grow the number of staff and grow their budget, and it appears from what I have heard so far that we are utterly powerless to do anything about it. If the Minister can give me some comfort that we can and will do something about it, fair enough, but it seems to me that</p>
	<p pid="b.634.3/2">either the Government approve of all this nonsense, which would be a terrible state of affairs, or we are powerless to do anything about it, which in my view is equally unacceptable.

Friend the Member for Christchurch is right to draw the matter to the attention of the Committee and to pursue his amendment, which I support with gusto.</p>

Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase>. If I really believed that the people of Shipley did not want to have human rights and participation in a convention that tries to guarantee for people across the wider Europe the same human rights that we&#8212;as he said, proudly&#8212;think we have in our own country, I would be shocked, but I believe that the people of Shipley deserve better. They deserve to hear an explanation of what this is about.</p>
	<p pid="b.635.0/2">As a Member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I hear these issues debated at every quarterly session and, I hope, participate with colleagues from both sides of the House to try to point out to many countries that are not in the EU that they are not giving human rights in the right quantity to their citizens, but this is about saying that the EU will have an organisation that will also monitor those things. Some might say, &#8220;If you have it in the Council of Europe, why require it in the EU?&#8221; The reality is that unless a body has economic and legal might, such as exist in the EU, many decisions, such as those taken by the Council of Europe, do not, I am afraid, carry much weight.</p>
	<p pid="b.635.0/3">There are thousands of cases against countries in the Council of Europe, which have been found in the Court of Human Rights to be in breach but which are not acted upon by the countries covered by it. There are many cases raised by Conservative Members of countries within the EU where there is a requirement for some muscle to be applied so that people cannot be locked up without trial. One case raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40447" name="Roger Gale">the hon. Member for North Thanet (Sir Roger Gale)</phrase>, who sadly is not in his place, relates to Malta&#8212;our own constituents locked up in other countries.</p>
	<p pid="b.635.0/4">The point of introducing the change that has been made in the EU is to allow the EU to start to participate in that activity&#8212;a role that I believe will be parallel to and supportive of what is happening in the Council of Europe and what is debated in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.635.2/1">I hope that the people of Shipley are not believing the mythical nonsense that has just been spoken. I have sat on the House&#8217;s European Scrutiny Committee since 1998, and the reality is that the European Commission can initiate proposals for legislation, but</p>
	<p pid="b.635.2/2">legislation cannot be agreed in the EU unless it is passed by the European Council, and we are one of 27 countries that take those decisions.

	<p pid="b.636.3/1">No, I do not want to continue with the Council of Europe. I have spoken at length in the House in debates on the functions of the Parliamentary Assembly, which I think is an excellent organisation that brings people back to why we come to Parliament. It is about the application of human rights. We often get tied up in playing our parties off against each other, but if we look through the lens of human rights we can very quickly see where the breaches are. There were huge outcries under the previous Government when we were locking up people for long periods without trial, which I objected to. Many of these things come back to the fundamentals.</p>
	<p pid="b.636.3/2">The EU is adding its weight. It has more power than the Council of Europe to deliver judgments and make those judgments stick, because penalties apply to things that the EU gets involved in. If we decided to break away from a European directive, we could, as a country, be fined. When, for example, Bulgaria refused to come up to scratch with its legal system, it had all its EU finances frozen until it brought itself up to a standard that was acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.636.3/3">The EU might attract many criticisms, and at times I find it greatly irritating, but I am pleased that it is adding its weight to the need to look at things on a human rights basis and to report on that. That is what the proposal is about.</p>

	<p pid="b.637.2/1">I recall that well, because I have been a Member of the House since &#8217;92, and I remember the very lengthy debates that took place, but this is not about the Maastricht treaty; it is about the proposal in the Bill, which is basically to set up a</p>
	<p pid="b.637.2/2">&#8220;Multiannual Framework for the Fundamental Rights Agency&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.2/3">That is the point that is of interest to me, because that is an important thing to do and we should be going forward with it. I hope that we do. If the Government really are about to do an about-face and vote against that, I wonder what their position was in the Council, when this went through. Were they voted down in the Council? Are they about to change their position?</p>
	<p pid="b.637.2/4">I am interested in the Government&#8217;s position as much as anyone else, but I am speaking from my point of view, looking at this as someone who has been on the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Scrutiny Committee for a long time. It is important, I believe, for us to realise that, while we might not like the fact that the EU sometimes asks us to do things that we might not have wished to do ourselves&#8212;for me, some of those are in fishing and agriculture, neither of which has been massively amended by anything that has happened recently under this Government&#8212;human rights will not be harmed in this country but will be advanced markedly in other countries by having the EU alongside the Council of Europe and the Court of Human Rights, fighting for human rights for all in Europe.

	<p pid="b.637.3/1">Is there not a concern, though, about the duplication and growth of those agencies? Even the European Commission, through Commissioner &#352;efcovic, said at the end of last year that we need to reform many of these agencies, which have unruly-sized governing boards, and try to prevent conflicts of interest. Just in this particular field, we have the Fundamental Rights Agency based in Vienna, the European Institute for Gender Equality based in Vilnius, and the European Asylum Support Office based in Valetta. Surely the question is, should we be growing this agency and giving it such a big budget and a multi-annual financial framework of such a size before we have undertaken some reform of those agencies?</p>

	<p pid="b.637.4/1">I take the point. It is well made by the hon. Gentleman, who speaks from the dual perspective of looking in from the European Union at the effect on other countries, and looking out now from this Parliament at what the European Union is doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.4/2">I find it remarkable that every time the European Union grows, we have a convention that the new member state gets a new Commissioner. At my first meeting in Brussels, I believe I raised the matter with UKRep&#8212;why did we need a new Commissioner every time we added a country? Why does every member state have to have an office of some kind because it does not have an office of some other kind? We did it. We were fighting over the universal patent recently, and the most important thing to the UK was where the patent court would be based. It had to be based in London. It was not about whether the patent was a good or a bad thing. There is a problem with the EU in that it sprays benefits around. I believe it has put some institution on Crete&#8212;a wonderful island where I have holidayed often, but I could not work out why a major institution of the European Union had been located on Crete, apart from the fact that the Greeks wanted to have their turn.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.4/3">That has to be looked at fundamentally, but the principle is correct. If the European Union sets up the agency, it will monitor what is happening with human rights, and I hope it will then begin to ask how it can help the Council of Europe, the European Court of Human Rights and those who want, as Churchill and many others did after the last war, to base Europe on human rights. The questions will continue about the corpus juris, which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase> will no doubt talk about, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> will no doubt talk about economic interference.</p>
	<p pid="b.637.4/4">After all that is discussed, I hope we will all be able to agree that if the EU supports the Council of Europe and does the business, making human rights available to all the people in the EU and then beyond, it will advance Europe in accordance with the original principles of the people who set up the convention, which should be at the heart of our politics.</p>

	<p pid="b.639.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point, which gets to the heart of one of my major concerns about the organisation and why I support entirely the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch. It highlights the confusion in the minds of our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.639.1/2">I wonder how many of our constituents even know that that body exists. I suspect that if I conducted a poll on the streets of Bury, I would have to wait a very long time and ask a large number of people before I found anyone who had even heard of the agency, never mind understood what it was intended to do. That is not surprising, because it was introduced in 2007 by the back door. It was introduced under the provisions of section 352 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union, the Lisbon treaty, which allows for such new bodies to be established without any proper discussion. As I say, it was introduced through the back door.</p>
	<p pid="b.639.1/3">The EU goes on about the principle of subsidiarity, but then we find that it is creating an EU-wide body to do things which, as we have heard in tonight&#8217;s debate, are not only being done elsewhere in Europe, but ought to be and can be done properly here in the UK. This is not a cheap body. We know that in 2013 the agency will get a subsidy of &#8364;21.3 million from the EU budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.639.2/1">Is it not anomalous that the agency should have a separate multi-annual financial framework for the five years from 2013 to 2017, rather than being rolled into the overall multi-annual financial framework from 2014 to 2020, which the Prime Minister has ably ensured will be significantly reduced?</p>

	<p pid="b.639.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. The question arises what would happen in a situation which has partly happened now and will certainly happen in the next multi-annual framework, where the agency straddles two financial periods. How can an agency properly budget when its framework straddles two budgetary periods? It does not make sense. That is just another example of muddled thinking in Europe, and of an organisation that has no intention of being transparent or open to the people whom it seeks to serve.</p>

	<p pid="b.639.4/1">I am sure my hon. Friend has noticed that in the supporting documentation it is asserted that there will be no impact on public sector manpower or cost. Having to deal with yet another one of these fiddly agencies means huge legal bills, on top of the ones that</p>
	<p pid="b.639.4/2">we have for the European Court of Human Rights and on top of our domestic ones. Is that not an awful lot of extra money?</p>

	<p pid="b.640.0/1">Yes. My right hon. Friend again makes an excellent point. We will find that someone who is concerned about a particular right in this country is faced with a plethora of bodies, and those involved in this field in this country have an extra body to liaise with on the European front. Whereas in the past they would just have looked to the contents of the European convention on human rights and the findings of the European Court of Human Rights, they now have to think, &#8220;I wonder what the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights will think about all this. I wonder what it has said about it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.640.0/2">I will not go down that road, as we have other amendments to consider and there is a further debate afterwards. I doubt whether we need that body at all. That is why I will support my hon. Friend&#8217;s amendments tonight. The body is unnecessary and it adds confusion to what is already a very crowded playing field in the area of human rights. I simply ask the Minister how the agency will benefit my constituents in Bury, North. How would they notice if it were simply abolished? That is what I think should happen.</p>

	<p pid="b.640.1/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> and I do not always agree on matters relating to the European Union, but we generally agree on matters relating to human rights. He does sterling service in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of the Europe as chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/2">Many of us agree, across the spectrum of views on the European Union, that because all 27 members of the European Union are members of the Council of Europe and signatories to the European convention on human rights, the Fundamental Rights Agency represents unnecessary duplication. I had rather hoped that in the Council document on the multi-annual framework that is mentioned in the Bill we would find a distinction between the legitimate area of activity for European Union institutions and what is done in the general field of human rights. Article 2 of the document lists the thematic areas that the Fundamental Rights Agency will deal with during the multi-annual framework period, the first of which are &#8220;access to justice&#8221;, which I thought was dealt with under the European convention on human rights;</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/3">&#8220;victims of crime, including compensation to victims of crime&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/4">issues on which there have been decisions in the European Court of Human Rights; the</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/5">&#8220;information society and, in particular, respect for private life and protection of personal data&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/6">on which much work is going on in the Council of Europe; &#8220;Roma integration&#8221;, which is one of the key problem areas that the secretary-general of the Council of Europe has identified for his five-year term; and</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/7">&#8220;judicial cooperation, except in criminal matters&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/8">which might be an area where the European Union has exclusive competence, particularly in commercial law, but I wonder whether even this is a necessary reason for the existence of the Fundamental Rights Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/9">The list continues with the &#8220;rights of the child&#8221;. I heard <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40369" name="Michael Connarty">the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> talk about that subject, on which he is a great expert in the Council of Europe, where he serves as a member of the Parliamentary Assembly. Why is it within the remit of the Fundamental Rights Agency? The next area is</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/10">&#8220;discrimination based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/11">This is all the red meat of what is discussed in the Council of Europe and the red meat of the implementation of the European convention on human rights. Then we have</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/12">&#8220;immigration and integration of migrants, visa and border control and asylum&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/13">Several committees are looking at that very subject at this moment within the Council of Europe. The final area is</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/14">&#8220;racism, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.640.1/15">Again, those issues are on the agenda of the Council of Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.641.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is a simple matter of fact that for many of the issues that he is delineating we in this country have been practising a proper discourse and addressing them coherently in UK jurisdictions, in many cases before the European Union even existed?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-11b.641.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40432" speakername="Robert Walter" colnum="641"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0003.htm#130211-0003.htm_spnew45">
	<p pid="b.641.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is partly why we were one of the founder members of the Council of Europe and one of the original signatories to the European convention on human rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.641.1/2">Article 3 of the document gives one a little hope, because it talks about</p>
	<p pid="b.641.1/3">&#8220;Complementarity and cooperation with other bodies&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.641.1/4">but one has to read all the way through it to find that it does not even mention the Council of Europe until the final sentence, in paragraph 5, which refers to the</p>
	<p pid="b.641.1/5">&#8220;Agreement between the European Community and the Council of Europe on cooperation between the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.641.1/6">That is all well and good. However, I hope that the Minister will deal with the question of resources. The Council of Europe has been constantly under pressure from all 27 member Governments, including our own, on how it disburses its budget. The ever-increasing work load in the European Court of Human Rights means that the majority of the budget goes towards its operation. Now we have another body, funded by exactly the same taxpayers in the 27 member states of the European Union, that apparently might not have the same financial constraints placed on it. Would it not make absolute sense if we, as the 27 members of the European Union, agreed to chuck the little packet of money that we are going to give to the Fundamental Rights Agency into the budget of the Council of Europe to make it the much more effective body in promoting human rights and respect for all the rights outlined in article 2 of the document? We could then ensure that we in the European Union can promote human rights much more effectively, particularly in the new states of Europe and the states to the east, as partners through our membership of the Council of Europe.</p>

	<p pid="b.642.0/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> provoked a very wide-ranging debate covering a large number of issues, some of which are to do with the Bill and a few of which are even to do with the amendments. They include the question of whether the Fundamental Rights Agency represents value for money and concern about the potential for duplication with the work of the Council of Europe, about which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40432" name="Robert Walter">the Member for North Dorset (Mr Walter)</phrase> spoke so eloquently.</p>
	<p pid="b.642.0/2">The Bill is limited to seeking parliamentary approval for an EU decision to agree the agency&#8217;s new five-year work programme. The programme simply identifies the thematic areas under which the agency will undertake its tasks. The amendments&#8212;my main contribution to the debate, Mr Evans, will be to talk about the amendments&#8212;have as their common purpose a desire to remove clause 1(2)(b) from the Bill, the effect of which would be to withhold parliamentary approval of the draft decision that seeks to establish the next five-year work programme for the agency. Without that parliamentary approval, the UK cannot vote in favour of this measure at EU level. I do not believe that withholding such approval is the right course of action. I urge my hon. Friend to withdraw the amendment, or the Committee to vote against it, for the following reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.642.0/3">The work programme is agreed by the Council. Agreeing the work programme provides member states&#8212;including, of course, us&#8212;with the opportunity to define the focus for the agency&#8217;s work for the next five years, encouraging it to concentrate its resources on a limited number of areas and to undertake targeted, in-depth research within the boundaries defined by the framework. The UK has participated actively in the negotiations that have led to the new draft programme being drawn up and is satisfied with the results. It is important for the Committee to be clear that the agreement of a new work programme does not alter the core tasks of the agency, nor does it change the agency&#8217;s role. The work programme does not set out or define these elements. They are set out in a completely different instrument&#8212;the agency&#8217;s establishing regulation, which is not under review in the Bill or in the amendments. I hear the views of many of my hon. Friends about the merits of the agency&#8217;s work, but neither this Bill nor the draft decision that it approves can do anything to bring about changes in those areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.642.1/1">I think that we have all been entirely in order and that the Minister should reconsider. We are saying that we want this thing to do a lot less and to do it much more cheaply. That is entirely in order, and it is our one opportunity to say it. We in this Government are meant to be looking for cuts. This would be an exceedingly popular one, so will the Minister cut the thing?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-11b.642.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="642"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0003.htm#130211-0003.htm_spnew47">
	<p pid="b.642.2/1">I was not suggesting for a moment that my right hon. Friend, my hon. Friends or anyone else who has contributed to this debate were out of order; I was merely making the point that I want to address the amendments. My right hon. Friend has expressed his views with characteristic force, but I have to disappoint him by saying that the amendments would not achieve what he hopes they would.</p>
	<p pid="b.642.2/2">Let me be clear about the consequences of the UK not approving the draft decision. Failure to agree the work programme would deprive the Council of the opportunity to set the direction of the agency by defining the themes. However, the absence of a work programme would not mean that the agency would go away or down tools. My right hon. and hon. Friends should bear that important point in mind when considering whether or not to support the amendment. If there was no draft framework, the agency would still be able to carry out its role. However, its focus would shift to answering requests for work from other EU institutions. Not supporting the framework therefore means that member states, including the UK, would have less influence on the work that the agency does. I do not think that that would be a good result for the UK and I suspect that my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch would agree with that.</p>
	<p pid="b.642.2/3">The themes set out in the work programme continue those in the current one, and I welcome the European Scrutiny Committee&#8217;s analysis that the proposed work programme can indeed be considered to be equivalent to the former one. Although there are some adjustments between the two work programmes with regard to terminology, the changes will not alter the work that the agency has been doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.642.2/4">During negotiations the UK Government were successful in ensuring that the themes set out in the work programme should continue to be limited to Community law. Other member states proposed the inclusion of themes on police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters. That would have been an extension of the agency&#8217;s work and it was successfully resisted by the UK Government. The draft decision records that we were successful. Agreeing to the draft decision will ensure that that is a binding decision of the EU institutions. That is why we are asking Parliament to approve it.</p>
	<p pid="b.642.2/5">Moving on to some of the specific points that have been raised, the issue of duplication of the work of the Council of Europe has been a feature of this debate. The agency&#8217;s role is to provide the EU institutions and member states with independent evidence on how fundamental rights are respected. It does so through undertaking research and producing comparative data of the situation of rights across those member states, and through producing indicators that can be applied across the EU. Some of my hon. Friends were treating it as though it were an alternative to either the European Court of Justice or the European Court of Human Rights. It is, in essence, a data collection and dissemination agency that does not do any of the work of the ECJ or the ECHR. I agree that that would be unnecessary duplication. The same point applies to those in this country who, quite reasonably, would not want to lectured by the Fundamental Rights Agency about our performance on human rights. It does not do that sort of thing&#8212;that is not the work that it does.</p>
	<p pid="b.642.2/6">There has been much discussion and concern expressed about money. This, of course, has to be set in the context of the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister earlier today. As he made clear&#8212;I think this was widely welcomed by all parties&#8212;the Government will continue to push for a good deal for UK taxpayers through agreement on the next multi-annual</p>
	<p pid="b.642.2/7">financial framework. The agency&#8217;s budget for the period covered by the next MAFF will form part of our negotiations following the agreement of that framework.</p>

	<p pid="b.644.1/1">The dissemination of hard facts and data on human rights performance across the European Union is intrinsically useful for British citizens and, indeed, those of other countries, because it enables us to assess how one of the basic things that we all wish to preserve&#8212;not just in our country, but in neighbouring countries&#8212;namely a basic commitment to human rights, is actually happening. It is extremely desirable for the citizens of democratic countries to enjoy human rights almost as a matter of habit, and it seems to me that any body that promotes such a state of affairs, in however small a way, is doing useful things for the British people.</p>

	<p pid="b.644.3/3">The decision to approve a new five-year work programme for the agency will continue to provide the Council with the authority to direct its work.

	<p pid="b.644.4/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Minister for responding so frankly. What he has said illustrates the farce we are in. As a result of the commendable passing of the European Union Act 2011, we are being asked to approve, among other things, the work programme of the Fundamental Rights Agency for the next five years. If we do not approve the programme, we have been told, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry&#8212;they&#8217;re going to go ahead with it anyway and choose their own programme.&#8221; Similarly, as the Prime Minister told us earlier with regard to the multi-annual financial framework&#8212;the next seven-year budget for the European Union&#8212;if a real-terms reduction had not been agreed, it would have carried on spending more than had been agreed anyway. That shows the extent to which we have been tied up in knots by the European Union and its institutions. The evidence coming out of this debate will be prayed in aid by people such as me when we get into the hard issues of debating whether or not it would be better to stay in or leave the European Union. I see this as part of that debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.644.4/2">This debate has raised a number of interesting points beyond the Minister&#8217;s insight into what our powers amount to in this case. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40432" name="Robert Walter">the Member for North Dorset (Mr Walter)</phrase> undertakes with extreme diligence his job as leader of the UK parliamentary group in the Parliament Assembly of the Council of Europe. He raised a number of serious issues. Such issues are being raised not just by him as leader of the UK delegation, but by a lot of other delegations. One such issue is that, at a time when the European Court of Human Rights and the Council of Europe are being starved of resources, we can see with our own eyes that the 27 member countries of the European Union feel that they can throw money at the gravy train that is the Fundamental Rights Agency. Sadly, I did not hear an assurance from my right hon. Friend the Minister about what the Government are doing to stop that. They may be powerless to do anything about it, for the reasons given in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.644.4/3">I do not think that that is good enough. We now have a situation in which we know that a lot of that money is being wasted. My hon. Friend the Member for Shipley referred in his excellent speech to undocumented migrants in Europe having access to health care. That was the very subject on the agenda at the Warsaw conference that I attended and on which I expounded on Second Reading. What a waste of money that was.</p>
	<p pid="b.644.4/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40369" name="Michael Connarty">The hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> was concerned about the five-year delays in getting judgments. The European Court of Human Rights needs more money if it is to increase the speed with which it deals with its casework. It is not getting extra money because the 27 members of the European Union would prefer to spend their money on the Fundamental Rights Agency.</p>

	<p pid="b.646.0/1">Again, I believe in the concept of reasonable expectations. Once a draft Bill has been produced and the Government have said that it will be put before a Joint Committee, I expect the Joint Committee to be appointed within a reasonable space of time.

	<p pid="b.646.0/2">I would love to recommend to my colleagues that we divide on this subject, but having heard from the Minister that even if we carried a Division, it would be of no use whatever and might even be counter-productive, I am minded to say that the best thing to do is to hope that the Minister will take back the concerns over the misallocation of resources between the Council of Europe and the Fundamental Rights Agency, and that he will see what he can do to change the system so that the next time we have a debate like this, we have the power to control the agenda and the work programme, rather than being presented with a fait accompli, the alternative to which is even more latitude for the agency concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.646.1/1">Clause 1 refers to the draft decisions on the Official Journal and the Fundamental Rights Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/2">I will refer to those two issues in a moment, but I would first like to say a little about clause 1(1), which sets out that when a decision is reached under article 352 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union, or the Lisbon treaty as it is known as, under section 8 of the European Union Act 2011 that decision must come before Parliament for ratification.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/3">As connoisseurs of these matters will be aware, article 352 is quite controversial. It is the so-called flexibility or enabling clause, which allows decisions to be taken when there is no legal base for them. Its predecessor was article 308 of the European Community treaty. When I was a member of the European Scrutiny Committee, we produced an excellent report on article 308.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/4">I am pleased that we have this new parliamentary power under the 2011 Act. I am sure that the Minister for Europe will recall that the Opposition consistently supported more powers for national Parliaments when the Bill was going through this House. The procedure with regard to article 352 is an important new power.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/5">I was, however, concerned that the former Lord Chancellor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke)</phrase>, said last year in evidence to the European Scrutiny Committee that an Act of Parliament was not required to enact the decision on the Fundamental Rights Agency because it satisfied the exemption requirement under section 8(6)(a) of the 2011 Act. That was rightly questioned by the European Scrutiny Committee. In a letter to the Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-22">22 November</phrase>, the Government stated that they had had second thoughts and that legislation would be brought forward after all. That is one point to the European Scrutiny Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/6">I find it strange, given the initial difference of opinion between the Government and the European Scrutiny Committee, that there is not even a passing reference in the explanatory notes to why the Government at first considered the decision to be exempt and then had a change of heart. Perhaps the Minister could tell the Committee what changed between the summer and winter of last year that prompted the Government to alter their position. Eventually, the European Scrutiny Committee cleared the document, but it stated that the Government&#8217;s uncertainty&#8212;I would say vacillation&#8212;had led to an inordinate delay.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/7">Clause 1(2)(a) is about giving binding legal effect to the electronic version of the Official Journal, as only the printed version currently has such veracity. This may be called the libation clause. I say that because, as I mentioned on Second Reading, this paragraph is required, in part at least, because of a ruling by the European Court of Justice on a case concerning the importation of red dessert wine into the Czech Republic.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/8">After being fined for breaking customs law, Skoma-Lux, the company that imported the dessert wine, brought an action in a Czech regional court in an attempt to cancel the fine. The company argued that the wine should not be classified as standard red wine and that the Act of accession for the new member states that joined in 2003 was not legally binding because it had not been published in Czech in the paper version of the Official Journal.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/9">After expert examination by the customs technical laboratory in Prague, the wine was indeed reclassified because, unlike most wines, it was made from grape juice that had added sugar and corn spirit. It was said that that did not change the</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/10">&#8220;organoleptic characteristic of the beverage&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/11">but did cause the wine to have a sweet taste that cannot be achieved by &#8220;standard wine production&#8221;. Because the regional court was not sure whether that could be discerned by customs officers, the issue was referred to the European Court of Justice. Sadly, I have been unable to find out the view of the European Court of Justice on that matter. Perhaps the Minister for Europe can help us.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/12">Although that is unclear, what is clear is that the European Court of Justice made a number of unequivocal statements with regard to the other point that was brought before it, namely the availability of EU law in the paper form of the Official Journal. The Court ruled that &#8220;making the legislation available&#8221; on the internet</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/13">&#8220;does not equate to a valid publication in the Official Journal of the European Union in the absence of any rules in that regard in Community law&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/14">In the light of that ruling, the European Commission agreed to bring forward a proposal. Political agreement was achieved at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of March 2012. Undoubtedly, easy access to EU law makes for speed and is economic, and it would obviously be advantageous to have legal certainty.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/15">Earlier I mentioned reservations in this House about the use of article 352, but it is worth noting that scrutiny reservations are not confined to this Parliament. I understand that other Parliaments, especially those in the Czech Republic and Germany, also had concerns about article 352 and the possibility of decisions being</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/16">taken without a given treaty base. On the legal status of the online Official Journal, I understand that Germany entered a parliamentary scrutiny reserve and therefore the German Government were unable to confirm their agreement. Will the Minister confirm whether the situation in Germany has been clarified, and that there are no problems in other member states?</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/17">The second part of the clause concerns the future thematic areas of work of the Fundamental Rights Agency. At the Justice and Home Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2013-05-31">31 May</phrase> last year, nine areas of work were agreed. Since then the European Parliament has formally approved the text. It will, of course, have legal effect only once the Council has adopted it&#8212;hence the relevance, once again, of this Bill. The FRA is limited in its work because it is confined to collecting and analysing data while providing advice and seeking to raise awareness of fundamental rights. It works alongside the European Court of Human Rights and its efforts are very much complementary to the work of the ECHR.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/18">As we heard this evening and on Second Reading, a number of Conservative Members have questioned the appropriateness of a body such as the Fundamental Rights Agency. In particular, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> asked whether it is really necessary for the European Union to concern itself with fundamental rights. Would it not be better, he argued, if we relied simply on the European convention on human rights and the European Court of Human Rights? That is not a spurious argument by any means and the hon. Gentleman put it well this evening. However, I ask Members to dip into the report by the House of Lords European Union Committee which addresses that point specifically, and although I would not concur with everything in that report, it makes the case extremely well.</p>
	<p pid="b.646.1/19">The report points out how the European Union can bring added value to the work of the ECHR, and refers to a number of areas where it can do that. Its first point is that the ECHR does not provide comprehensive coverage of the fundamental rights agenda. Last week my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40668" name="Emma Reynolds">the Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds)</phrase> gave a good, specific example of where the FRA has conducted useful comparative research on the position of gay people&#8212;research that is not being undertaken by any other body, including the ECHR. There are many more substantive examples of value that can be added by the European Union and the FRA.</p>

	<p pid="b.648.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has cited examples of where the Fundamental Rights Agency is investigating areas into which the European Commissioner for Human Rights&#8212;a Council of Europe appointment&#8212;has not delved. Surely it would be more logical if we were to use those resources for the benefit of all 47 member states of the Council of Europe. It is in the 20 member states that are not members of the European Union that those rights are inevitably most at risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.648.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes the point: there is a mismatch between the Council of Europe and the European Union, not least in terms of the membership of those two constituent organisations. It can become awkward and cumbersome, but that obvious overlap</p>
	<p pid="b.648.1/2">should be recognised and efforts are being made by both parties to minimise the duplication of work. It is significant, for example, that the Council of Europe has an independent expert who sits on the board of the Fundamental Rights Agency. A physical interrelationship takes place, which is to be warmly welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.648.1/3">One conclusion of the important report from the other place was that:</p>
	<p pid="b.648.1/4">&#8220;EU legislation brings a considerable added value over the ECHR in that it can be effectively enforced&#8230;It can also cover matters not adequately covered by the ECHR and is more flexible&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.648.1/5">Those are important considerations. We are talking about two different beasts. The work is complementary but it is also different and it is important to recognise that.</p>
	<p pid="b.648.1/6">In conclusion, it is not my intention to trespass into the debate about whether or not the UK should exercise next year its block opt-out of so-called third pillar issues. That is a debate for another time, but I say simply that these issues need careful and rational consideration. Given the interest in related issues, I hope that this House will have umpteen opportunities to consider the profound decision that will have to be made next year. This clause has the support of the Labour party and we are pleased that time has been allocated for the discussion of the Bill on the Floor of the House. We hope Members from all sides will feel able to support the clause.</p>

	<p pid="b.649.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40137" name="Wayne David">the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)</phrase> for the Opposition&#8217;s support for this clause. He asked a couple of specific questions including why the Government changed their mind about the applicability of the exemption in the European Union Act 2011 to these measures. Originally, the Government thought that section 8 exemptions applied to a decision previously adopted under article 308 of the treaty. However, having reconsidered the issue of exemptions, and partly owing to the sterling work of the European Scrutiny Committee and its equivalent in another place, the Government concluded that decisions previously adopted under the legal base of article 308 do not fall within the exemptions in the 2011 Act. Therefore, along with future article 352 decisions that were previously adopted under article 308, such decisions will require parliamentary approval through primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.649.0/2">The hon. Gentleman also asked about the state of play in Germany, and I am happy to assure him that Germany and all other member states have completed parliamentary scrutiny of this issue. The Council is awaiting the decision of the UK Parliament before the decision can be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="b.649.0/3">We have discussed exhaustively the work programme of the Fundamental Rights Agency, and the hon. Gentleman made a good point that the other part of this clause is about allowing the electronic version of the Official Journal of the European Union to be regarded as an authentic version. I am sure the Committee will agree that in the modern world in which electronic communications are now as normal as paper communications, that is a sensible measure that will not increase costs for the UK and its taxpayers.

	<p pid="b.650.5/1">It is difficult for me to speak for them, but perhaps some countries feel that only if they have a Commissioner of their own will they have sufficient patronage to distribute. It is within the patronage of any Government to appoint an EU Commissioner. For example, we have heard rumours that the way out for the Deputy Prime Minister will be to be appointed the next UK EU Commissioner.</p>

	<p pid="b.650.7/1">My hon. Friend makes a telling point, and I am sure that the Minister will respond to it with the benefit of his knowledge when he winds up. So often we talk hard on these EU issues&#8212;sometimes the Government and Ministers talk hard on them&#8212;but when we have it in our power to do something about them, we pull our punches and let the matter slide away. Especially now, in the build-up to the decision that the British people will be invited to take on whether we should leave the European Union, it is vital that the Government do not duck these issues, but face up to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.650.7/2">I very much welcome what the Prime Minister said in his statement to the House earlier today. It was against the background of it being pointed out in the German newspaper <i>Die Welt</i> that the Prime Minister was wrong to suggest that hundreds of eurocrats were paid more</p>
	<p pid="b.650.7/3">than him or Chancellor Merkel, because its research had shown that the actual figure is 4,365. The Prime Minister said how disappointed he was that the administrative costs will still be some 6% of the EU budget, and he said that reducing the level of those costs would be &#8220;a long-term project&#8221;. Well, this modest amendment would be a start.</p>
	<p pid="b.650.7/4">Just because there will be more EU Commissioners, it does not mean that the expenditure incurred by them should increase pro rata. The amendment does not ask for any real-terms reduction in the total spent on EU Commissioners, but it suggests that the total amount spent at the moment should be redistributed among the 28 or 29 Commissioners.</p>

	<p pid="b.651.1/1">I hope that that is not the case, although I do not know whether my hon. Friend has been tipped off about what the Minister will say in response to the debate. I cannot see the point of the Bill if we cannot pass an amendment that has been accepted as in order. The amendment would simply make it a condition of our acceptance of having an EU Commissioner for each member country that the total budget should not be increased if the number goes above 27, but should be shared among however many Commissioners there are. I would be amazed to be told that such a modest amendment was not within our power, especially when we know that it would be going in the direction of travel&#8212;to use that ghastly expression&#8212;of many other members of the European Union who are concerned that its administrative expenditure seems to absorb far too much money.</p>

	<p pid="b.651.3/1">That is a fair point, and it was reflected in what the Prime Minister said earlier. He said that the European Commission simply has not looked at what it can do to constrain its administrative expenditure. He has a lot of knowledge about that issue because he sees it face to face every time he goes to Brussels or any other European institution. He can see the amount of money wasted on bureaucracy in Brussels. There is obviously scope for a modest reduction, and that is why I had hoped that I would have already received notice that the Government intended to accept my amendment.</p>

Are we really serious about these issues, or are we just going through the motions? I look forward to hearing from a Member of this House who thinks it is wrong to limit the expenditure of the European Commission to what it is at the moment so that it cannot be increased. If there are such Members, I hope that they will have the courage of their convictions and stand up. If that does not happen, then I hope the Government will accept the amendment. It gives me great pleasure to have moved this modest amendment. Looking at it, I wonder whether it is too modest. On the other hand, it would be better to get this on the record than to create too much controversy.</p>

	<p pid="b.652.3/1">With characteristic modesty, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> has presented his amendment. He also discussed the scope of clause 2, and I wish to speak to that before I come on to his amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.652.3/2">The hon. Gentleman highlighted the fact that there is a live debate on both the shape or membership of the European Commission and on financing it. Clause 2 provides for the current formula of one Commissioner per member state to be maintained at least for the next Commission. According to the explanatory notes, it also provides for a review of that decision either before the 2019 European Commission is formed or before the 30th member state joins the EU, whichever is sooner. We are having this debate today, we had a debate on it on Second Reading and it will continue to be debated. I want to highlight some of the points that were made on Second Reading.</p>
	<p pid="b.652.3/3">There are two sides to this debate. On the one hand there is a complaint&#8212;one that I think we should listen to, and one I am sure other hon. Members will make&#8212;that the European Commission College of Commissioners has become too big and unwieldy. As the EU has grown to 27 member states&#8212;soon to be 28&#8212;there are simply too many Commissioners and that has had an effect on how it can take decisions. The other side of the argument, put powerfully and effectively by the Irish Government in recent years, is that for small member states the</p>
	<p pid="b.652.3/4">current formula of one Commissioner per member state guarantees an equality that would not otherwise be secured. That point has been made in the intergovernmental conference and the convention, in the constitutional treaty discussions and the Lisbon treaty negotiations by Ireland and other small member states, although not all. I mentioned last week that Denmark is of the opinion that although it does not want to give away that equality, it is worth giving it away in order to make the European Commission a more effective decision-making body.</p>
	<p pid="b.652.3/5">Those are the two sides to the debate. On Second Reading, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40137" name="Wayne David">the Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)</phrase> and I suggested that there is a case for considering different degrees of seniority. If we were to keep one Commissioner per member state, then, as with our system of government where there is a Secretary of State and Ministers beneath that level, we could keep one Commissioner per member state, but with degrees of seniority, which might make for more effective decision-making.</p>

	<p pid="b.653.0/1">Does the shadow Minister think there would be any merit in a system whereby only those countries that were net contributors to the EU had a Commissioner?</p>

	<p pid="b.653.1/1">All I would say to the hon. Gentleman is that that is a fluid situation, so it would be unfair to both new and existing member states. For example, the Polish economy is the only economy that I can name, certainly in Europe, that did not go into recession after the global financial crisis hit, and so its trajectory is healthy. We would do well to remember that the success of the Polish economy might mean, sooner than the hon. Gentleman might think, that it will become a net contributor rather than a net recipient.</p>
	<p pid="b.653.1/2">On Amendment 4, which was tabled by the hon. Member for Christchurch, last autumn he and I were in the same Division Lobby calling on the Government to seek a cut in the EU budget, and we strengthened their hand in the negotiations. To an extent I agree with the spirit of his amendment and see some merit in it.</p>
	<p pid="b.653.1/3">It would be better, however, if the hon. Member for Christchurch called on the Government to prevent an increase in the administration ceiling in the EU budget. According to the comparative table we received following last Friday&#8217;s negotiations, however, that ceiling will increase by 8% over the MFF period. I do not think that such a big victory. We heard a lot of cheers earlier during the EU Council statement, but very little attention was paid to that point, and it is a point worth considering. That would be a more powerful demand for him to make of the Government than their writing into this fairly minor Bill the conditions he has set out. For that reason, I am not in favour of the amendment, although, as I said, I agree with its spirit.</p>

	<p pid="b.653.2/1">The amendment aims to freeze the number of staff and resources available to Commissioners at the level provided for 27 Commissioners, no matter how many such Commissioners there are. It seeks, therefore, to make the UK&#8217;s approval of the draft decision to revert to the system by which every EU member state has its own Commissioner dependent on that condition being implemented. I have</p>
	<p pid="b.653.2/2">to disappoint my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> as I cannot recommend that the Committee accept his amendment. There are three reasons for that that I hope will provide him with a measure of reassurance.</p>
	<p pid="b.653.2/3">First, there are technical reasons concerning the consequences of my hon. Friend&#8217;s amendment. Secondly, there are certain safeguards within the current structure of the EU budget that mean that some of the dangers about which he is concerned ought not to arise. Thirdly, I hope to give him clear reassurances both about the Government&#8217;s robust commitment to seeking every opportunity to secure greater economies and efficiencies in EU expenditure and about some of the negotiations and instruments where those objectives that he and I share might be achieved.</p>
	<p pid="b.653.2/4">I completely share my hon. Friend&#8217;s concern about the need to improve efficiency in all EU institutions, including the European Commission, but we need to be clear about what the consequences would be were this amendment to be carried. The Bill provides simply for the approval of the draft EU Council decision on the number of EU Commissioners. The draft decision provides neither the scope to change the allocation of resources within the Commission nor the power or opportunity to influence the overall EU budgetary ceilings, the individual budget headings, either on a multi-annual or annual basis, or the allocation of resources within each of those budgetary headings. Were it to be carried, therefore, the amendment would leave the UK unable to agree to the change proposed to the number of Commissioners, but would not provide the means by which to alter EU expenditure in the way that he is seeking.</p>

	<p pid="b.654.1/1">That brings me to my second point, which is that if British Ministers were to open that kind of conversation with our partners, their immediate response would be to say that such is already provided for in the European Union&#8217;s budgetary set-up. Even if the number of Commissioners increases to 28 or beyond, that cannot result in any increase in the ceiling set by the multi-annual financial framework, which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister negotiated last week at the European Council; nor can an increase in the number of Commissioners lead to an increase in annual spending limits. To paraphrase what I think my hon. Friend said in moving his amendment, if there has to be additional expenditure to provide for a new Commissioner and his or her team, it would need to be found from elsewhere in the European Union budget, subject to the ceilings set unanimously by the European Council in respect of the multi-annual framework and, subsequently, each annual budget negotiated and agreed by qualified majority vote on a 12-monthly basis, so there is a measure of safeguards already.</p>
	<p pid="b.654.1/2">Let me also make this point to my hon. Friend. I am the first to agree that when we look for efficiencies and economies, we should not be shy about looking for savings in small matters as well as large. However, we also need to be clear about what an extra Commissioner would entail. It is true that it would mean providing somewhere in the budget for a salary for that Commissioner and their immediate cabinet. That money would have to be found, within the ceilings, by sacrificing spending opportunities elsewhere, but the process would not mean the creation of entirely new directorates-general. Indeed, I can tell the House that the discussions already under way about provision for a probable new Croatian Commissioner involve the splitting up of existing directorates-general and parcelling them in a slightly different way, not adding to the overall number of new people working for the Commission. We are talking about a redistribution of responsibilities among a larger number of Commissioners.</p>

	<p pid="b.655.1/1">What I am saying to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch is that the objective that is explicitly sought in the amendment&#8212;to ensure that the budget does not increase as a consequence of the appointment of additional Commissioners&#8212;is a principle that is already embodied in the European Union&#8217;s budgetary arrangements, both multi-annual and annual.</p>
	<p pid="b.655.1/2">My third point is about what is perhaps the most important area. It should remain a key priority for the Government of the United Kingdom&#8212;and, I should add, for a fair number of other national Governments around the European Union&#8212;to look for ways to make the European Union more efficient in everything it does and to look for every opportunity to eliminate wasteful or unnecessary expenditure. There are a number of ways that that could be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.655.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40668" name="Emma Reynolds">The hon. Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds)</phrase> talked about a possible reconfiguration of the Commission along a senior Minister/junior Minister model. That is not something to which the UK Government are committed at the moment, but it is certainly one idea that is being discussed in think-tanks and elsewhere as a means of trying to impose not just greater efficiency, but greater coherence on the operations of the Commission. If we look at the Commission today, to provide one illustration, we have a Commissioner for External Relations, who is the High Representative on foreign policy, and we have separate Commissioners for international development, for disaster relief and for European Union enlargement. One conceivable model would be to see those four portfolios given to a Commissioner who was head of department and to subordinate Commissioners reporting to that more senior post holder. That is one way of seeking greater efficiency, but there are many others, too.</p>

	<p pid="b.656.7/1">I may be able to put on record the exact figure later on, but I do not have it in the notes in front of me at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.656.7/2">The other opportunities lie in measures such as the staffing regulations for EU institutions, which are the subject of negotiations at the moment. It is those regulations that govern the salaries, the pensions, the tax status&#8212;or perhaps the non-tax status&#8212;of EU staff. Those regulations govern such matters as allowances, on which I think my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch and I would be in agreement. It is impossible to justify objectively the payment of an expatriate allowance to staff who are working in Brussels rather than London or Paris and</p>
	<p pid="b.656.7/3">who have in some cases been working there for well over a decade yet still receive this expatriate allowance to recognise the apparent hardship of having to work in the Berlaymont.</p>
	<p pid="b.656.7/4">There are many opportunities that we can and should seek for reform. The Government are determined to do that, and I believe that they have strong support in the House for so doing. However, it remains in the interests of the United Kingdom for this decision to be ratified. I hope that, having heard what I have said, my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch will feel able to withdraw his amendment, and to be confident in the Government&#8217;s resolve to continue to work for the greatest possible economy and efficiency in every part of the European Union&#8217;s work.</p>

	<p pid="b.657.0/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend the Minister for his full response to the concerns that have been expressed this evening and the concerns that gave rise to my modest amendment, and I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40668" name="Emma Reynolds">the hon. Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds)</phrase> for agreeing with me in spirit, which is something that I certainly value.</p>
	<p pid="b.657.0/2">I am also grateful to the hon. Lady for drawing the Committee&#8217;s attention to the prediction that the administrative ceiling will rise by some 8%, a figure that seems to be pretty much undisputed. That demonstrates the truth of an observation made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40134" name="David Nuttall">the Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall)</phrase>. If it is as difficult as it seems to have been to bring about a zero increase in the EU&#8217;s administrative budget, how difficult will it be to win back those powers and responsibilities for our own Parliament during the negotiations leading up to the referendum? That just shows how tough a job it is to make any progress in the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.657.0/3">I accept my right hon. Friend&#8217;s view that there are difficulties with my amendment, and that it would have, as he put it, technical consequences. However, one does despair when, following all the excitement associated with the power effectively to veto these proposals under the European Union Act 2011, as soon as we start threatening to use the veto&#8212;or even arguing for a modest amendment, or for the attachment of a condition to something that the European Union wants to change &#8212;we are told &#8220;Oh, we cannot do that, it would be ever so difficult&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.657.0/4">I am sure that you share my frustration, Mr Hoyle. We discuss all this stuff, and then, when we reach the end of the debate, it seems that we have travelled no further in terms of substance. We appear to have thrown in the towel in allowing an increase in the number of Commissioners, and it will be very easy for the Commission to increase its expenditure if there is an 8% increase in its ceiling for administration.</p>
	<p pid="b.657.0/5">However, the debate has provided an opportunity for everyone to see exactly what battle we must fight with the European Union if we are to win back any substantive powers. Furthermore, because I am as concerned as many of my hon. Friends about the hard deal that people in rural areas have had as a result of the local government settlement, I do not want to eat into the time that is available for the debate on that subject by pressing for a Division. I therefore beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="b.658.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="b.658.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I want to thank all right hon. and hon. Members who have participated in our debates on the Bill. I thank the hon. Members for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds) and for Caerphilly (Wayne David) for the support that the official Opposition have given to the Bill. It has been a significant piece of legislation on two counts. First, it has been a useful test of the procedures included in the European Union Act 2011. In the Act, we committed ourselves to providing Parliament with more opportunities to scrutinise European Union business, and the Bill is evidence that we are delivering on that commitment. The requirement for debate and primary legislation to govern these decisions has added to Parliament&#8217;s hold over EU business.</p>
	<p pid="b.658.0/3">Secondly, the proceedings on the Bill have shown that the Government have been prepared to listen carefully to the views of parliamentary Committees. As was said earlier, the Government originally thought that the decision about the work programme of the Fundamental Rights Agency was exempt from the requirement for primary legislation under the 2011 Act. However, we took careful note of the serious argument put forward by the European Scrutiny Committee of this House and the European Union Select Committee of the House of Lords that that was not the case. Our legal advisers looked again at the matter, and we accepted that, on this occasion, Parliament was right. We accordingly brought forward the necessary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.658.0/4">I should like to put on record my gratitude for the outstanding work done by officials in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Justice on this legislation, and my thanks to my right hon. Friend the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice and the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40103" name="Mark Simmonds">the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> for their work on the earlier stages of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.658.0/5">The Government believe that all three measures contained in the Bill are in the best interests of the United Kingdom, and that they are sensible and reasonable proposals. None of them will have a significant domestic impact, and none will result in any additional financial burdens being imposed on this country. I commend the Bill and its Third Reading to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.658.1/1">As the Minister for Europe has said, this is the first Bill that the Government have introduced under the European Union Act 2011. It has constitutional significance for that reason, even though it is small. When we are debating European matters in the House, I often look to the other place for wisdom and learning, but on this occasion, I looked at <i>Hansard</i> and found that there had been no debate on the Bill in the other place. That was quite a disappointment. I am pleased to say that we in this House have spent many more hours deliberating on the Bill, and enunciated many more words than their lordships on it. That is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.658.1/2">We have had good debates on Second Reading and in Committee. The Bill deals with three draft decisions, which have been well discussed. The first will give legal effect to the online version of the Official Journal of the European Union. The second will establish a multi-annual framework for the Fundamental Rights Agency. The third, which is much more controversial, deals with the maintaining of the status quo regarding the formula for the number of commissioners&#8212;that is, one commissioner per member state. As I said on Second Reading and in Committee, the debate on that matter is still live and ongoing, and we will return to it when the Commission of 2019 is created. The three decisions that are dealt with in the European Union (Approvals) Bill have the support of the Opposition. They are sensible ways forward and we support the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.659.0/1">I just want to put on the record the Liberal Democrats&#8217; support for the Bill. The various measures it introduces, which we have rehearsed at length on Second Reading&#8212;the multi-annual framework for the Agency for Fundamental Rights, the deal on the number of commissioners, and the e-publication of the European Parliament journal, on which we had an important debate&#8212;demonstrate the belt-and-braces approach the coalition has now brought to European scrutiny in this place.</p>
	<p pid="b.659.0/2">As should be noted, this is an historic first use of the European Union Act 2011. I congratulate the Minister and his whole team on steering the Bill through the House of Commons. Although its course was not exactly perilous, one or two rocks and stones had to be overcome.</p>

	<p pid="b.659.1/1">It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40163" name="Martin Horwood">the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase>. I congratulate the Minister on pursuing this Bill. Despite some of the things I have been told about the lack of</p>
	<p pid="b.659.1/2">scrutiny in Parliament of EU matters, tonight&#8217;s debate, unlike that in the other place, has demonstrated an appropriate degree of scrutiny of matters that require unanimity at the Council and a change in our domestic law.</p>
	<p pid="b.659.1/3">I am persuaded that it is perfectly sensible to allow the electronic version of the official register to be binding. The multi-annual framework for the agency is not a financial framework, and therefore is perhaps not quite as important as the own-resources cap and the need to consider an EU finance Bill in this Chamber. However, under article 312(4) of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union, it is far from certain that, even if the framework were a financial framework, it would enable the inter-institutional agreement to come into effect and allow inflation increases in that budget without the proper sanction of this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.659.1/4">The debate on the number of commissioners is really significant. The previous Labour Government entered into a deal at the European Council, whereby they would agree to a commissioner for every member state and implementing the necessary legislation at a later point, in order to try to drive the Lisbon treaty through a second Irish referendum. Had we known then that we would have this level of scrutiny here and that the decision would be dependent on a vote in this Chamber, where a Conservative-led Government have a majority, we could have made it clear that we did not agree with the Lisbon treaty. In such a situation, why should a Conservative-led Government regard themselves as signed up to a deal, negotiated by Labour, to force the Lisbon treaty through Ireland, without our having the same opportunity for a referendum in this country?</p>
	<p pid="b.659.1/5">That is a key thing we have learned, and I hope Ministers will reflect on that when they seek to renegotiate our relationship with the EU, and that they are certain that anything they may agree on at a political level will have to be delivered by the legislatures of the member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.659.1/6" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.659.1/7" class="italic">Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.</p>

	<p pid="b.661.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.661.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House has considered the matter of the local government finance settlement for rural local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.661.2/3">We have only a short time for this debate&#8212;just over an hour. We were expecting a three-hour debate, but unfortunately we have been squeezed by various statements during the day and a substantial debate on Europe. However, I am happy to take interventions and will try not to speak for too long.</p>
	<p pid="b.661.2/4">One can tell by the number of Members in the Chamber that this is a very important debate&#8212;on the share of grant that rural authorities are receiving from Government &#8212;that we take extremely seriously. I very much welcome the meetings I have had with the Minister and the sympathy he has shown. What we want to do this evening is take away not just sympathy but a little money, which is a little easier to put in our pockets.</p>
	<p pid="b.661.2/5">The Department for Communities and Local Government announced the local government financial settlement for 2013-14. It will reduce central Government support to councils while doing nothing to address the long-standing inequality in funding between rural and urban councils. We are not asking for a change in the Government deficit reduction strategy, as we support the Government in taking tough decisions to tackle the budget deficit inherited from the previous Administration; a quarter of all public expenditure is accounted for by councils and that must be addressed. Instead, we are here this evening, even at this late stage, to press the Secretary of State to revise the proposed settlement and make good on the long-standing promise to correct this historical imbalance and give rural local authorities their fair share of central Government funding, in line with the summer consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.661.3/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the rural penalty, which sees 50% more per head going to urban councils than to rural councils, cannot be justified, even by increased levels of deprivation in the urban areas? The additional cost of delivery in rural areas and of need in rural areas means that there is a demand across the country for a fairer settlement.</p>

He chairs the Rural Fair Share campaign, and I thank him for pursuing this issue with Ministers with such tenacity and for helping to secure this debate. I agree with him entirely that the current situation just is not fair. We are not here to rob urban authorities of their money, but we are saying clearly to the Government that there are inequalities and they must be put right.</p>

	<p pid="b.663.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and there should be rural weighting. We are talking not only about the distances between villages and hamlets, but the distances between schools and the number of small schools in rural areas that are the heart of the village. If the local schools were to be destroyed, the village itself could be destroyed, so there is an awful lot to play for here.</p>

	<p pid="b.663.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that in rural areas there are often a lot of self-employed people who are reluctant to apply for benefits such as free school meals, which are sometimes a measure of deprivation? Rural areas therefore lose out in that way as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.663.2/1">My hon. Friend raises an interesting point about how we define the rural population and how we define depravity&#8212; <i>[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps I should refer to those who are deprived, rather than to depravity. I still want to make a serious point, because there is a problem with how the statistics are compiled and how judgment is made on rural areas. We in rural areas are all supposed to be wealthy and are asked to pay a great deal more of overall local government spending in our council tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.663.3/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that sometimes the rural authorities that have been the most careful&#8212;doing the right thing&#8212;are the most penalised? For example, Devon has saved &#163;100 million in the past three years, yet its gross value added has declined over seven years and is now 78% of the UK average.</p>

	<p pid="b.663.4/1">Again, one of my hon. Friends raises a good point, because this has been going on for a long time. It went on under the previous Government and, dare I say, probably went on slightly under the previous Conservative Government. In those days, I was in local government. Savings were made and we cut our cloth accordingly, but along came the Government saying, &#8220;You have been so careful with your spending that you can now cut it some more.&#8221; I wonder whether central Government recognise those authorities, such as Devon and others, that have spent money wisely and made savings, yet are asked to make further reductions. The Minister is extremely concerned to make this fair, but we need not only to talk about it, but to sort it out.</p>
	<p pid="b.663.4/2">Let us consider, for instance, the amount raised in council tax. Rural authorities such as Mid Devon and East Devon, which I represent, will raise in council tax nearly twice as much as, say, a local authority such as Greenwich. Therefore, rural populations are not only not getting a fair share of grant, but have to fund much more of local government spending from council tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.663.4/3">The Government spend a lot of time talking about the overall spending power of a council, but I would argue that it is how we get to that spending power that matters. If we are asking our local residents and council</p>
	<p pid="b.663.4/4">tax payers to provide much more of that spend via their council tax than those in urban authorities do, we in the countryside are being over-taxed and, dare I say, urban authorities are being slightly under-taxed. We were told last year that that would be put right.</p>

	<p pid="b.664.0/1">Will my hon. Friend consider the fact that the higher council tax paid by many rural authorities is a reflection of the increased cost of service delivery? It is hardly likely to be due to inefficiencies.</p>

	<p pid="b.664.1/1">Yes. My hon. Friend makes a good point, because there is an extra cost in delivering services in rural areas and rural authorities. However, whatever the cost of delivering a service, we cannot get away from the inequality in how much is given in Government grant to rural authorities compared to urban. I expected and still expect&#8212;I have great expectations of the Minister and of the coalition Government&#8212;the promise of equal shares for rural authorities to be delivered on.</p>

	<p pid="b.664.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. Back in 2004 we saw funding drift away from rural authorities towards urban authorities and we thought that now there would be a rebalancing, but that is not happening and, as he says, we will have to wait until almost 2020 before that is put right.</p>
	<p pid="b.664.3/2">If we do not get this year&#8217;s settlement right, lower funding for rural authorities will follow in subsequent years. We will see many changes, especially in district councils, where business rates will be retained, but the amount that they are able to spend will still be controlled by central Government. That is why this year&#8217;s settlement is particularly important.</p>

	<p pid="b.664.4/1">On that point, in my 15 years as a Member of Parliament I do not think I have seen such anger on the part of rural council leaders in Mid Suffolk district council. One of the most numerate of councillors I have ever met, Councillor Derrick Haley, who has cut services to the bone and been incredibly efficient and innovative, is incredibly angry. Has my hon. Friend picked up that sense of anger from very competent, diligent and loyal Conservative council leaders?</p>

	<p pid="b.664.5/1">My hon. Friend is right. The position is the same in Devon, where the Devon county council leader made enough savings to get through the current budget and was going forward well, but his budget was cut yet again. That is the problem. Devon is reputed to have more roads than Belgium, for instance, which is why the cost of repair, particularly after the floods, is so large. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is absolutely true. There are more roads in Devon than there are in Belgium.</p>
	<p pid="b.664.5/2">Rural authorities have to deal with high fuel prices, and the cost of education in schools is much higher. Devon is the 244th lowest in the table for school funding.</p>

I shall be interested to hear what he says this evening about bringing back some of the funding that has been taken away by damping. That is what we are after tonight.

	<p pid="b.666.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. On roads, for example, in my constituency there is not only the cost of their upkeep but of dealing with the snow, and the bus network covers 900 sq km. He will immediately see that huge costs are falling on Durham county council.</p>
	<p pid="b.666.1/2">We need to have more community centres and village halls&#8212;extra facilities to deal with the fact that people cannot be expected to travel all the time to reach their public services. Last month I had a particularly poignant example involving a training centre in a village that is needed because the bus fares are so high to get to the further education college in the main town. Unfortunately, because of the cuts in the local government settlement, Coundon and Leeholme community partnership found that the training centre was going to have to close. That is a terrible problem for the people in the village, who will not be able to afford the training that they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.666.1/3">School transport is also a significant problem. It is absurd for children to be walking 3 miles to and from school every day, as is possible under the law at the moment. Such laws were instituted in the days when there was not a lot of traffic on the roads as there is now. We really need to pay attention to these special rural issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.666.1/4">I want to say a couple of things about the system. The summer consultation showed that rural areas were gaining more than &#163;30 million, but those gains were lost because of damping, as the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton said. A one-off grant of &#163;8.5 million has been provided to some authorities for 2013-14, but there is apparently no plan to continue with the grant beyond that period. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us his plans for future years, because rural areas have lost proportionately more than urban areas. I want to raise with him a specific point about Durham.</p>

	<p pid="b.666.2/1">Will the hon. Lady provide the House with the information that she suggests exists?

	<p pid="b.666.3/1">Given that Durham county council faces a 40% cut over the spending period, I could not possibly agree with the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s contention.</p>
	<p pid="b.666.3/2">At the start of last week, the Government announced an extra &#163;8.5 million for rural areas. A list was published on Monday by the Department for Communities and Local Government indicating that County Durham would benefit by &#163;224,000. Later in the week a further, revised list was published in which Durham&#8217;s &#163;224,000 had disappeared. The allocations for other areas had also been taken from the list. What is happening to Durham? Why were we on the list in the first place?</p>
	<p pid="b.666.3/3">Why are we not on the list now? What has the Minister done, not just with our county, but with others that have been moved off the list?</p>
	<p pid="b.666.3/4">It is clear that rural fire authorities have suffered a larger fall in their grant than urban ones, even when their share of the &#163;8.5 million is included. Rural council taxes are an average of &#163;75 a head more than urban council taxes. That is because of the extra costs of delivering services in rural areas, not because rural authorities are less efficient. The result is that rural authorities will be at least &#163;60 million worse off than they might reasonably have expected to be next year.</p>

One of its problems, not just now, but over many years&#8212;this goes back a long time&#8212;is that it has battled against various Government cuts.

	<p pid="b.667.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. She knows from her own constituency how difficult it is to live in rural areas where the cost of care, of the</p>
	<p pid="b.667.3/2">school run and of everything else is high. I know that she does a marvellous job for her constituency and that she will continue to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.3/3">Sedgemoor district council is at the other end of my constituency. It has a much more successful base, but it is still under enormous pressure because of the differential. It builds huge warehouses and does so much to bring in industry. It has been very successful, but it is still 20% behind. If we do not address this situation now, not only will a lot of councils opt out, but how will we get councillors? Why would somebody become a councillor in an organisation that may well disappear on their watch? It is just not going to happen. It is becoming more obvious that, unless a decision is made quickly, local government may not last until 2020. The decision has to be made in this financial year, or the next at the outside.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.3/4">The two options are either to cut urban or put up rural. That is it&#8212;there is not a lot else we can do. The Minister has to decide which way we go. It will not be easy, because we do not have the money, but quite simply something must be done if we do not want all our district councils to disappear and turn into great unitary councils and if we are to keep the local democracy that so many people across Torridge and West Devon and so much of this House hold dear.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.3/5">I plead for West Somerset council, because I think that it needs to survive. The Minister and everyone else have done their best, but the odds are still skewed against it. On that note, I will not detain the House any longer.</p>

	<p pid="b.668.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.668.0/2">I chair the Rural Fair Share campaign with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40430" name="Dan Rogerson">the Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40672" name="Tony Cunningham">the hon. Member for Workington (Sir Tony Cunningham)</phrase>. The campaign has support across the House, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" name="Helen Goodman">the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase> suggested in her powerful speech, which I hope Ministers listened to closely.</p>
	<p pid="b.668.0/3">The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland highlighted the cost of delivering services. One does not need to be a public service economist to understand that point; one just needs to look at a map. If one adds to that the fact that rural areas have older populations than urban areas&#8212;populations that are ageing quickly&#8212;and the costs of domiciliary care, one can feel the immense pressure that there is on the system in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.668.0/4">As has been said, rural areas have been poorly funded for a long time compared with urban areas, despite the fact that the costs of delivery are often higher. Overall, rural residents earn less than people in urban areas, but pay council tax that is &#163;75 per head higher. Therefore, rural people, having paid more out of a lower income base, have a level of spending power for services that is lower than that in urban areas. There is no evidential base for that fundamentally unfair situation. That is the point that I hope Ministers will take on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.668.0/5">There is a rural penalty that sees urban areas get 50% more per head in central Government funding than rural areas. That position is indefensible. If it is not indefensible, we would like the Government, who must have done the analysis, to explain to us why it is</p>
	<p pid="b.668.0/6">just and reasonable for people in rural areas, many of whom are elderly and on low incomes, to be so unfairly treated.</p>

	<p pid="b.669.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I know that I am not on your list, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I want to challenge my hon. Friend because he has rightly referred to the Department&#8217;s statistics and comparisons. Over the past few weeks since this has become a topic of such serious concern, there has been a lot of dispute between Ministers and sparse rural local authorities. Will my hon. Friend spare a minute or even half a minute of his speech to explain what that difference of opinion is and why those of us who represent rural local authorities differ seriously from the Department?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-11b.669.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40076" speakername="Graham Stuart" colnum="669"  time="021:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#130211-0004.htm_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.669.1/1">I thank my right hon. Friend. I will explain the position. A year ago, a delegation went to see the Prime Minister to deal with this issue. In the summer, the Department consulted on a new way of looking at things that recognised the increased cost of sparsity in the formula. It came out with a figure that looked very promising in respect of reducing the 50% rural penalty. It then damped 75% of the gain away so that there was a 2 percentage point closing of the gap from a 50% rural penalty to one of merely 48%.</p>
	<p pid="b.669.1/2">When the December settlement came out, our first analysis showed that that 2 percentage point gain had been wiped out. In fact, it had been entirely reversed and we were looking at a 2 percentage point increase in the rural penalty. We met the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40286" name="Brandon Lewis">the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis)</phrase>, who is responding to this debate&#8212;he has been most helpful in having meetings&#8212;but we struggled to get the position of the officials on the numbers that the Rural Services Network had come up with. It turned out that 500,000 people had been added to the population of London. When that information is put in, the 2 percentage point increase per head turns into a 0.2 percentage point narrowing.</p>
	<p pid="b.669.1/3">The good news, which I can share with the House, is that the Government&#8217;s settlement takes a 50% rural penalty and reduces it by 0.2 percentage points to 49.8%. As I understand it, that is why technically the Government can claim that there has been a narrowing of the gap. It is pretty minuscule and nothing like the closing of the gap that we were talking about in the summer, which even then was derisory. Ministers are right, if they are doing so, to hold their heads in shame at that situation. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Was that too harsh?</p>
	<p pid="b.669.1/4">I say to those on the Front Benches that Members participating in this debate come from across the House. We are looking for a fairer settlement and we hoped and expected that the Government would look at the issue on an evidential basis. We are not seeing that and it is not good enough. There will be a vote on Wednesday, and I hope that those on the Front Benches will consider carefully the speeches made this evening. All Government Members support the need for austerity and strict control of the spending envelope, and we do not argue for greater Government spending. We are saying, however, that at a time of limited resources, the allocation of those resources is more, not less, important. It may be politically more difficult and challenging and take some courage, but if less resource is around, we cannot afford</p>
	<p pid="b.669.1/5">to punish further those who have already put up with too much. That is our message to those on the Front Benches, and I sincerely hope they will listen.</p>

	<p pid="b.670.0/1">My hon. Friends who preceded me have expressed with elegance and precision the real points, and I hope that Ministers on the Front Bench&#8212;it is good to see the Secretary of State in his place today&#8212;will discover deep down a will to remedy this issue. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40118" name="Ian Liddell-Grainger">the Member for Bridgwater and West Somerset (Mr Liddell-Grainger)</phrase> set out the problem for West Somerset, and said that other districts in similar positions will face precisely the same predicaments just a year or two down the line.</p>
	<p pid="b.670.0/2">I represent one or two such districts&#8212;Torridge district council and West Devon borough council are small, highly rural councils both facing an existential threat from the proposals in this settlement. Although West Devon council&#8217;s needs assessment was raised by 60%, the effect of damping is to reduce the overall funding settlement by 2.5%. Over the next three years it must take out &#163;1.4 million from a budget of &#163;7.5 million. It has already saved &#163;1.5 million over the past three years, and the five years before that it saved &#163;2.5 million by sharing back-office services with South Hams district council. My question to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is: where is the council to find the money?</p>
	<p pid="b.670.0/3">West Devon council scrutinised with anxious care the &#8220;50 ways to save&#8221; document published by the Department which is, if I may say so, a practical manual full of common sense. There is one problem, however, because it has already implemented 47 of the 50 measures. Only three are left and they might have a marginal and peripheral effect. That is why West Devon council&#8212;which I use as a case study only&#8212; is facing over the next three years the need to take &#163;1.4 million from a budget of &#163;7.5 million. It has no serious revenue asset base; its council tax is already at a high level and it has been obliged to disobey the strictures of the Secretary of State by failing to freeze council tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.670.0/4">Since the Secretary of State is present, let me say that I appreciate his robust style. Government Members love him; we think he is an asset to the Conservative party and to the Government. However, I plead with him: could he temper his language just a little? There are hundreds of good Conservative councillors up and down the length and breadth of the country who from time to time listen to his words and misunderstand. We know he does not mean it; we know it is just a joke. We know he is only teasing and that he is doing it in a loving way. The truth is, however, that those Conservative councillors&#8212;and other councillors&#8212;need to be loved and not always criticised. They are facing precisely the problem that my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater and West Somerset so eloquently set out, and a situation that is simply untenable over the next three or four years.</p>
	<p pid="b.670.0/5">It is no good producing &#163;8.5 million from the back of the sofa for this year only; they will have to produce it over the next few years as well. I say to Ministers on the Front Bench that we cannot go on fudging and dodging the issue. These small district and borough councils are facing a serious threat, and I urge Ministers to take it as seriously as it deserves.</p>

	<p pid="b.671.0/1">I shall be brief. My constituency has four principal authorities, with a mix of urban and rural that makes life quite difficult. In any event, I see clearly the concerns of Purbeck district council, part of which lies in my constituency. It is obvious that rural councils will be subject to extra costs when delivering services, but the question is, &#8220;How much extra cost?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/2">I would like to make a plea for some work to be done on this question. Presumably, there was some work done on it, because originally the local government settlement was looking most promising, with some consideration given to increasing funding in relation to sparsity, which was excellent. But then along came damping, followed by the &#163;8.5 million grant, which is positive, but for one year only. I want some transparency. What is the deficit? If we knew that, and we could all see what the position was, people would feel happier. Hearing about 1% and 2%, or that rural councils are really better off, is confusing. Why cannot we have a clear, pat answer &#8212;the position is this, because of that. I do not see that that should be beyond the bounds of possibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/3">While the average awarded in Government grant per head of population last year was &#163;487, or &#163;324 for rural areas, Purbeck received only &#163;215 per head. Average council tax in England is &#163;398, but in Purbeck it is &#163;594. Everything is exaggerated as we go through the figures. The pre-damping figure for Purbeck was &#163;295,000, but post-damping it is &#163;121,000. Surprise, surprise, when we get the share of the &#163;8.5 million grant, it is a mere &#163;6,879 for Purbeck, which will not give a great deal of scope for finding more efficiencies, if indeed there is any more to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/4">We have a problem. We have reduced local government expenditure and they have implemented so many cuts. We have the battle between the councils, but we can only be sure that we are getting the best deal for our residents if we have total transparency and figures provided to us that actually explain the situation rather than blurring it.</p>

	<p pid="b.671.1/1">The stark contrast between rural and urban areas is clearly demonstrated in my constituency, part of which is drawn from the urban unitary area of Southampton and the rest from the rural area served by Test Valley borough council and Hampshire county council. They are good councils working hard to deliver top-quality services at the most economic cost. They are rightly proud of their combined record in that regard, but they face difficult challenges because of the very nature of the geography they must cover.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.1/2">Hampshire is a county where town and country often meet, and where it is not unusual even within boroughs for there to be massive contrasts between the relatively highly populated urban centres and the vast rural areas where populations are much more spread out; where schools serve vast areas but comparatively fewer children; where refuse collection is much more challenging just because of the sheer miles to be covered; and where there are real problems in delivering adult social care because the distances for carers to travel between elderly residents in need of assistance are significant.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.1/3">Those of us representing rural areas can point to examples, and what we see as the challenges, but the difficulty is that there is little hard evidence. Instinctively, we may feel and see differences between rural and urban, but research by the Department is desperately needed to assess the extent of the disparity. Rural councils cannot demand comparative evidence from their urban neighbours in order to make a proper comparison, but such a comparison is desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.1/4">In Hampshire, a population of 1.3 million is spread over 1,400 square miles&#8212;it is the largest county in the south-east of England. But its size brings about very real challenges. The 5,000 miles of road not only need to be maintained properly, at a cost of &#163;60 million a year, including Operation Resilience, which completely resurfaces Hampshire&#8217;s roads, but&#8212;as we can see today&#8212;those same roads need to be gritted and snow-ploughed.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.1/5">Of course, we cannot guarantee that residents will live in the most accessible parts of the county. We cannot be assured that schools will be easy to access. In Hampshire, there are 500 schools varying in size from just 50 pupils up to 1,800. In small villages in particular, delivering education presents a challenge and prevents councils from achieving economies of scale. In the Southampton part of my constituency, primary schools have an average number on roll of nearly 250, whereas in some of my village schools the figure is only 50. That is not to say that provision is any harder or easier; it is just different.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.1/6">Councils that have to provide services such as education and transport have become expert at doing so. However, in many instances it is more and more of a struggle to cut their cloth sufficiently sparingly to go around. As I said earlier, it is important to have comparators and that a reassessment be done, so that when we stand in this Chamber and make the case for rural areas we can do so from a base of knowledge and evidence</p>

	<p pid="b.672.0/1">Today we have seen a welcome announcement in the House: a rise in the threshold for eligibility to social care to &#163;123,000 and the improvement of having a total cap on care costs. However, this will have huge implications for local authorities, because it will bring many more people into statutory eligibility for care. This will not come into force for several years, but the settlements in place now will have long-term implications for the future, and great implications for rural areas and rural authorities such as Devon, the fifth-oldest of all the local authority areas in England. The implications will combine with the similar kind of arrangements that occur, for example, in health.</p>
	<p pid="b.672.0/2">Increasingly, there is a trend towards prioritising funding to address health inequality, rather than focusing on health need. The older one is, the greater one&#8217;s care needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.672.2/1">It is ageist. We need to consider what elderly people require. How can we justify the fact that older patients in inner-city authorities have three times the amount spent on their cancer care than those living in a rural authority? For any condition that we might want to consider&#8212;be it diabetes, arthritis or dementia&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.672.2/2">rural local authorities&#8217; needs will be higher. How do we justify to our elderly constituents, or to a carer for someone with dementia, that they are entitled to less? Why do we rate the value of an elderly person with dementia so much less in a rural area such as Devon than we do in an inner-city area?</p>
	<p pid="b.672.2/3">We have to consider health inequalities, but other parts of the budget are more appropriately considered as modifiable areas for change. However, many conditions are not modifiable as health inequality issues. Will the Minister say what can be done to address health and social care needs? It is not just about addressing need, but the cost of delivering care. It might take a care worker in Devon 40 minutes to travel between appointments, whereas distances and costs will be far less in inner-city areas. There is also the consideration of whether a care worker can be found at all in many rural areas. Will those on the Front Bench consider the challenge of rurality? To be deprived in a rural area is to be additionally deprived. I hope that Ministers will address that by distributing funding more equitably to rural areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.673.0/1">There is the possibility that those on the Front Bench will have a weary cynicism about this debate&#8212;a feeling that statistics are being thrown around, that special pleading is going on, names of councils being showered down on them, and figures of 50% or 2% and different definitions and so on being mentioned, but the point, of course, that hon. Members are making on both sides of the House is not about councils, but about rural communities and the very particular situation in which rural communities in Britain find themselves after 50 years of intense fragility.</p>
	<p pid="b.673.0/2">We are talking not about individuals, wealthy second-home owners or people who retire to the countryside, but about organic, living communities of the sort that we prize in this country and that everyone in the Chamber prizes&#8212;communities containing young families, living small farms and a living school. Those things desperately depend on how rural councils are funded, however, and they face a perfect storm. Ministers are not the only people putting pressures on them. It is important to understand the overall context in which agri-environmental schemes, the huge movement towards supermarkets and capitalism itself have eroded rural communities. This is simply the last straw on the camel&#8217;s back. For all the reasons we have heard in the House&#8212;sparse population, fuel poverty, cost of living&#8212;these communities now face a serious crisis. Whatever we do with the 50% or the 2%, rural councils have inherited a situation in which they are significantly less well funded per head than urban councils.</p>

	<p pid="b.673.1/1">As my hon. Friend points out, this situation has been going on for a long time, so does he share my disappointment that, although we thought that this would finally be dealt with and that rural communities would get their fair share, that does not appear to be happening?</p>

	<p pid="b.673.2/1">That is an excellent point. Perhaps Ministers will address the fact that this is an inherited situation, stretching back to the &#8217;60s and the &#8217;70s, and relating to the debts of urban councils and the types of</p>
	<p pid="b.673.2/2">assets that urban councils possess. The financial settlement was not designed to address real instances of deprivation or to take into account the indexes of deprivation that we all experience day to day&#8212;the cost of heating rural homes, the cost of living and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.673.2/3">The nub of the argument, however, has to be about the communities themselves&#8212;about why we care about them and wish to keep vibrant, living, organic communities alive. There are three reasons: first, there will come a time when we treasure the food security offered by those small farms, which do not exist independent of the funding that the council is prepared to provide for schools, transport or housing; secondly, tourism, which is one of the most rapidly growing sectors in the rural economy, is dependent not on our weather or food, but on a living landscape of humans; and finally, the fact that this is something deeply precious to Britain. In this the 21st century, our country has the privilege of being one of the most advanced developed countries in the world. We can set an example to other countries of how an advanced industrial economy should behave, what kind of civilisation and future we want and what kind of landscape we imagine for our grandchildren. The decision that Ministers make today will determine that: it will determine whether instead of a network of small farms, organic communities and vibrant villages, we end up with nothing but a wilderness for millionaires.</p>

	<p pid="b.674.0/2">The Opposition would not support a drift of funding from deprived urban authorities in order to make up the shortfall in rural authorities, but that is not to say that the rural authorities do not have a important case &#8212;a case that has been eloquently put by hon. Members this evening.</p>

	<p pid="b.674.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will know that that has been the situation over decades, as we have heard from other Members, but we are not talking about just an urban-rural split. Larger county councils in other parts of the country, such as the south-east, are demonstrably overfunded, whereas councils and authorities such as Cornwall are underfunded. This is not an urban-rural thing; it is about looking at where the need is and ensuring the money gets there.</p>

	<p pid="b.674.2/1">The complexity of local government funding is certainly an issue, but when the hon. Gentleman refers to an historic problem, I remind him that in every year of the Labour Government, local government saw growth in its budgets. Only since the election of the Conservative-Liberal coalition have we seen a huge reduction in funding for local government. Of course we must argue for a fair share for rural authorities, but that should not be achieved at the expense of urban authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.675.0/1">My hon. Friend draws attention to a real problem with the council tax freeze grant, as have Government Members this evening. Local authorities of every political persuasion have seen through the Secretary of State&#8217;s wheeze. For many local authorities, taking the grant would clearly create significant problems down the road. That is why we are seeing Conservative, Liberal Democrat and Labour authorities refusing to take the grant, for very good reasons.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.0/2">We have heard contributions this evening from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" name="Helen Goodman">the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase>, who we have just heard from again, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40076" name="Graham Stuart">the hon.

	<p pid="b.675.1/1">This is about the allocation and getting a fair share&#8212;hence the name of the Rural Fair Share campaign.

	<p pid="b.675.2/1">I hope the hon. Gentleman would agree, however, that it would be completely unfair to impose even deeper cuts on some of the most deprived local authorities in urban areas. The real issue is that the Secretary of State volunteered to accept unprecedented funding cuts&#8212;far higher than those for any other Department&#8212;in local government. The blame rests fairly and squarely on his shoulders; he has let down local government in rural and urban areas alike.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/2">We also heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>, who made a significant contribution in calling for greater clarity about funding for local government. She made the point that there is no scope in her local authority for more efficiencies. She and others have seen through yet another scam from the Secretary of State: his &#8220;50 ways to save&#8221; document. Let me tell him that all local authorities have been doing that for years. I do not understand what he is talking about when he issues such a document. It might make a good soundbite in a press release, but he is not living in the real world.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/3">We also heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40614" name="Sarah Wollaston">the hon. Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston)</phrase>, who talked about the cost of delivering health and social care needs in rural areas and referred to the cost of rurality. It was interesting that the Secretary of State, sotto voce, did not seem to understand the term &#8220;rurality&#8221;. Perhaps that is an indication of the sort of problems that local government in rural areas is suffering from.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/4">Finally, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" name="Rory Stewart">the hon. Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase> talked about the importance of communities, but when the Secretary of State agreed the unprecedented</p>

	<p pid="b.676.0/1">I regret the tone and the personalisation.

	<p pid="b.676.3/2">What I regret is the Secretary of State letting down or betraying local government. Again, it is important to understand that it was this Secretary of State who volunteered for the biggest single reduction in Government funding of every Government Department. Government Members might not like to hear that, but that is the truth of the matter. If the Secretary of State had stood up for local government, local councils would not be in the parlous situation in which they find themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.676.5/1">It is clear that the rural authorities are by no means the only authorities to have been dealt an almighty body blow by this Government&#8212;far from it. Councils in the north, councils in the south, councils in the east, councils in the west, county councils, district councils, borough councils, metropolitan councils, unitary councils, councils that serve urban areas and councils that serve rural areas: all have suffered at the hands of this Secretary of State. As I have already said, if he had done his job properly, today&#8217;s debate would not have been necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.676.6/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for eventually giving way. Of course, his Government reduced the number of councils in Wiltshire and Cornwall that were underfunded in rural areas by abolishing them.

	<p pid="b.676.7/1">Not at all. We are not making that point in any way, shape or form. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has made it clear that Labour&#8217;s policy is to give a fair deal, a new deal, for local government and to allow local government on the ground to determine the shape of local government, rather than it being imposed from the top. The local authorities to which the hon. Gentleman refers wanted the local changes brought about by the Secretary of State at that time.</p>

	<p pid="b.677.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40608" name="Neil Parish">the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)</phrase> on securing today&#8217;s important debate. It seems ironic that the first time I am at the Dispatch Box at this time of night since the last time I was here at this time of night, we are debating rural areas looking for fair funding. Last time, it was about urban areas, and Newcastle Members and others made the same sort of case for those areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.677.3/2">I shall have to keep my remarks relatively short, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40201" name="Chris Williamson">the hon. Member for Derby North (Chris Williamson)</phrase> talked for some time, and I want to ensure that my hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton gets the chance to sum up. If I do not cover everything Members have brought up this evening, I would be happy for them to come and see me&#8212;now or over the next few months&#8212;as we continue to argue passionately and with great determination over the issues raised tonight. However, as one of my hon. Friends commented a few moments ago, the tone of the debate changed dramatically when the hon. Member for Derby North decided to avoid the fact that it was the last Government who had pledged &#163;52 billion in local government cuts. Labour Members have seemed not to want to discuss that in any way, while opposing every change and every reduction that we have introduced to deal with the deficit that we inherited from their Government. That cannot give any credibility to what they say about the money that is needed for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.677.3/3">The hon. Gentleman spoke of standing up for local government. What he should have observed tonight, and over the past few weeks, is the Secretary of State and other Government Members standing up for their local residents, for their communities, and for the hard-working taxpayers for whom we have introduced the council tax freeze option.</p>

	<p pid="b.677.4/1">In that spirit&#8212;the spirit of Government Members standing up for their communities &#8212;will the Minister invite the Secretary of State to stand up for local government throughout the country, and argue with the Treasury the case for giving it a fairer share of the cake? Does he accept that its funding has been cut by 28%, which is a far larger reduction than any imposed by other Departments?</p>

	<p pid="b.677.5/1">I thought that the hon. Gentleman had something to say that was different from what he had already said. Again, he avoided mentioning the &#163;52 billion of cuts that his party had pledged to make. My point is that Government Members, including the Secretary of State, are standing up for the people whom we are elected to stand up for&#8212;the hard-working residents who will benefit from the council tax freeze that this Government are providing.</p>
	<p pid="b.677.5/2">Let me say in the few moments that I have left that the thinking behind this local government financial settlement took into account ways in which councils can make progress in the years ahead, and that we believe it to be fair to both north and south and to both rural and urban communities. As others have pointed out, we have managed&#8212;although, I recognise, not to the extent that some would have liked&#8212;to reduce the gap between rural and urban. We have made adjustments to relative needs formulas to reflect the greater cost of providing services in rural areas. That is one of only three formula changes in the settlement. We have increased the weight of super-sparse areas in the formula, doubled the sparsity weight for older people&#8217;s social care, reinstated the sparsity adjustment for county-level environmental protective and cultural services, and introduced a sparsity adjustment for fire and rescue. As a result, funding per head is falling by less in predominantly rural authorities than in predominantly urban authorities, in all classes.</p>

In particular, I would like to thank Gill Bjork, Michelle Blair and Gavin Rattray for their commitment to keep fighting the corner of Burscough residents.

	<p pid="b.681.1/4">Declares that the Petitioners reject the proposed developments by West Lancashire Borough Council in their West Lancashire Local Plan because of the following detrimental effects; the loss of Green Belt and agricultural land, the loss of a safety buffer between residential and industrial areas, the further strain on inadequate infrastructure; roads, sewers, health services and schools, the damage to the environment through pollution and loss of habitat, the devaluation of property, the loss of identity as a village and finally because there is no guaranteed benefits to local residents.</p>

	<p pid="b.682.2/1">I secured this debate to highlight the antisocial and criminal behaviour of a tiny minority of individuals who cause havoc in the countryside. These rural ruffians are blood sports enthusiasts who have been getting away with this lawless behaviour for far too long. To my mind, they are no different from the mindless yobs that blight some of our urban housing estates, but the police, regrettably, are turning a blind eye to their lawless behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.682.2/2">I have been a trustee of the League Against Cruel Sports since 1979, and I was the press officer and then the chair of the Hunt Saboteurs Association 35 years ago, so I know from first-hand experience what these characters are capable of. I was regularly assaulted and threatened by hunt supporters, and I would like to give the House just one example of an incident that happened to me. Following a lengthy car chase, my vehicle was rammed by a supporter of the Quorn Hunt who was driving a Land Rover. Just a few minutes later, several other Quorn Hunt supporters used powerful catapults to fire steel ball-bearings at me. I was therefore delighted when Parliament struck a blow for decency by passing the Hunting Act 2004.</p>

	<p pid="b.683.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely correct. People cannot understand why some Government Members want to bring back this barbaric activity. The overwhelming majority of the British people want blood sports to remain consigned to the dustbin of history. As my hon. Friend points out, the vast majority of the British public want the Hunting Act to be retained.</p>
	<p pid="b.683.0/2">The Act should have consigned hunting to the dustbin of history, yet such is the arrogance of some members of the hunting fraternity that they think they are above the law. However, they need to understand that nobody in this country is above the law&#8212;not even them. Organisations including the League Against Cruel Sports, Hunt Watch, Protect Our Wild Animals, the Hunt Saboteurs Association and the International Fund for Animal Welfare, along with many other conscientious individuals, have continued to monitor hunt activity. They all tell a consistent story: hunt violence and hunt havoc continue to blight the lives of ordinary people living in and visiting our beautiful countryside.</p>
	<p pid="b.683.0/3">I have been genuinely shocked by the evidence that has been passed to me about the behaviour of these common criminals. Antisocial behaviour, intimidation, harassment and even violence directed towards those monitoring their activities are all too commonplace. I could not believe that the violence and intimidation, which I witnessed in the 1970s, is even worse today. The disregard for the wider rural community is another feature of their selfish, arrogant behaviour, which includes road blocking; invading and damaging private property; rampaging hunting dogs killing livestock and beloved pets; causing road traffic accidents; and recklessly trespassing on railway lines.</p>
	<p pid="b.683.0/4">I am not suggesting that everyone who participates in hunting is an arrogant, violent thug. Indeed, I am sure that most hunt followers obey the law. However, worryingly, a significant minority are arrogant, violent thugs, which is why urgent action is needed to tackle this flagrant disregard for the law. Of course I understand that the police numbers have been reduced, but where the law is being routinely abused, the public must have confidence that the authorities will take action. That is why the Government must act to give the police the tools they need to do the job.</p>
	<p pid="b.683.0/5">Since I secured this debate, I have been inundated with examples of the lawless behaviour of sections of the hunting fraternity. The incidents are too numerous to list them all tonight, but I wish to give just a few examples to illustrate the kind of people and the sort of incidents I am talking about. In December, a hunt monitor reported to Okehampton police an assault that was captured on film. She was told to attend the police station with evidence of the assault, but, after reviewing the DVD, police officers told her that no offences had been committed. They said that there were just some driving issues that the offenders would be advised about, that any assault was part of a hunting issue and that she should not have been on the public footpath in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.683.0/6">Last summer, a south Pembrokeshire hunt supporter was jailed for three and a half years for firearms offences while at a hunt, after a hunt monitor was shot in the head by what transpired to be a modified single-shot handgun. The man also had a sawn-off shotgun and ammunition inside his van, and a further 16 guns were found in his home. In Devon, two separate home owners sold their houses and moved away from the area after</p>
	<p pid="b.683.0/7">being victimised by the local hunt. The hunt master of the Crawley and Horsham hunt, Kim Richardson, was recently filmed telling hunt monitors,</p>
	<p pid="b.683.0/8">&#8220;You&#8217;re all fair game now&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.683.0/9">On <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-04">4 January 2012</phrase>, a female hunt monitor was violently assaulted by a supporter from the Cottesmore fox hunt. The woman was on her own when she saw the hunt&#8217;s hounds illegally chasing a fox. When she intervened, she was thrown to the ground by a man who smashed her over the head with an aluminium bottle before pinning her down and pouring the bottle&#8217;s contents over her face.</p>
	<p pid="b.683.0/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-18">18 March 2012</phrase>, supporters of the Ross Harriers hunt broke the window of a vehicle belonging to a monitor and attacked the monitors with an iron bar. One of the victims of the attack suffered injuries to the leg and head.</p>

	<p pid="b.684.3/1">I have a lot to say and I want to make some more progress. If I have time, I will let the hon. Gentleman in towards the end.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.3/2">One of the monitors was left with welts on his back and a serious eye injury after the attackers tried to throw him down a ravine. An ambulance was called to treat him, but could not reach him after it was deliberately held up by vehicles belonging to hunt supporters, who hurled abuse at the paramedics.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.3/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-03">3 November</phrase>, the Crawley and Horsham huntsman Nick Bycroft was filmed breaking the wing mirror of a moving vehicle and then trying to smash the window with his whip. However, the West Sussex police, who were on the scene, refused to take action. On Boxing day, five armed men from the Southdown and Eridge fox hunt attacked a solitary hunt monitor, beating him around the head and injuring his hands. Keys and equipment were stolen from the vehicle, yet the East Sussex police refused to visit the hunt meet to identify the culprits.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.3/4">Earlier this afternoon, I watched a short DVD produced by the International Fund for Animal Welfare, which illustrates the intimidation, theft and assault to which its monitors have been subjected. I have to say that I found the footage shocking.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.3/5">I also have evidence&#8212;a letter from Thames Valley police&#8212;of one particular hunt incident dating back to January 2011. It involved a Thames Valley police detective inspector who told a complainant that the case was</p>
	<p pid="b.684.3/6">&#8220;fundamentally flawed (principally due to the delay in time since the offences)&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.3/7">Is an offence not an offence whenever it takes place? Is the passage of time a valid reason not to pursue?</p>
	<p pid="b.684.3/8">It is not just hunt monitors who are the victims of these militant blood sports fanatics. I also have recent examples of other types of antisocial behaviour where these rural ruffians have run amok. In Kent, a farm manager&#8217;s wife was pushed off a public footpath by</p>
	<p pid="b.684.3/9">horse riders who were galloping across a narrow area. She was pushed into a hedge after grabbing her pet dog to save him from being attacked. The Goathland and Staintondale hunts killed a pet cat. In Devon, a Staffordshire terrier was attacked by hunt hounds. In Yorkshire, recovering horses at a sanctuary were distressed by rioting hounds. The owner of the sanctuary subsequently received threats&#8212;incredibly&#8212;from a member of the hunt. A Surrey cattle farmer had his herd disturbed on a number of occasions, causing severe distress to many of the cattle. In Somerset, a sheep farmer complained of sheep being distressed by hunting hounds. In Gloucester, horses were distressed by trespassing hounds that killed a fox on private property. In north Cornwall, animals from a small holding were disturbed by rioting hounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.3/10">Those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. In what other part of society would that be acceptable? The simple answer is that it would not be. The irony is, of course, that none of this is necessary. If those recalcitrant hunt supporters and their unacceptable practices were not tolerated by the hunting fraternity&#8217;s hierarchy, those incidents would stop. By complying with the terms of the Hunting Act, all the transgressions I have outlined could be avoided.</p>

	<p pid="b.685.0/1">Does my hon.

	<p pid="b.685.2/1">I respect the fact that the hon. Gentleman has given way. We could both stand here all evening making such comments. I have spent 20 years compiling a list of incidents of violence against legitimate country people and hunt supporters, particularly by members of the hunt saboteurs in balaclavas and all that. Will he accept two things? First, could he not at least seize this opportunity to apologise to all those people&#8212;women and children included&#8212;who have been on the receiving end of violence from the hunt saboteurs? Secondly, could he not recognise that in every instance that he has mentioned there is existing law to deal with the matters that he has brought to the attention of the House?</p>

	<p pid="b.685.3/1">If anybody is owed an apology, it is the victims of the hunt violence that I have referred to. I regret the fact that the hon. Gentleman has not taken the opportunity, as a former chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, to offer that apology tonight.</p>
	<p pid="b.685.3/2">If the hunting fraternity complied with the terms of the Hunting Act, the hunt monitors, whom they seem so frightened of, would be welcomed because the hunts would not be doing anything unlawful. However, the Masters of Foxhounds Association and the Countryside Alliance have singularly failed to deal with the lawless behaviour in their midst.</p>
	<p pid="b.685.3/3">Will the Minister reassure me that he will issue an instruction to chief constables stating that the Hunting Act must be upheld? Will he also ensure that chief</p>
	<p pid="b.685.3/4">constables take steps to prevent hunt supporters from intimidating anyone who is lawfully monitoring hunting activities? Will he state for the record that, as far as this Government are concerned, no one is above the law? Does he agree that the mixed messages from senior Ministers could be misinterpreted by some people as tacit approval for breaking the law? Will he urge his senior colleagues, including the Prime Minister, to stop criticising the Hunting Act?</p>

	<p pid="b.686.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40201" name="Chris Williamson">the hon. Member for Derby North (Chris Williamson)</phrase> on securing this evening&#8217;s debate. It is not often in an Adjournment debate that the full emotions behind it are apparent, but they already have been this evening. The House will be aware of the strong emotions and feelings held on both sides of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.686.0/2">In the last few minutes of his speech the hon. Gentleman set me some challenges, so let me address them directly. Violence at hunts is unacceptable, whether that is violence towards those who are hunting or towards those who are protesting against hunts. As with any violent crime, I would expect the police to take appropriate action should violence occur at a hunt.</p>
	<p pid="b.686.0/3">The hon. Gentleman also said that he wanted me to direct chief constables to do certain things. I should point out to him as gently as I can that it is not for Ministers to tell chief constables how to do their job. One of the things that we most cherish about British policing is that the police are operationally independent, and when politicians try to direct police in detail as to how they should do their job, they enter very murky&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.686.4/1">Let me get to the facts. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40151" name="Simon Hart">the Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (Simon Hart)</phrase> said, on both sides of the hunting debate it is possible for people to compile a list of grievances. That is what has happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.686.4/2">Let me turn to the question of policing at hunts very directly. There are over 325 registered hunts in England and Wales. Together they have carried out over 70,000 days&#8217;</p>
	<p pid="b.686.4/3">hunting since the Hunting Act came into force in 2005. From 2005 to 2011, the latest year for which official figures are available, a total of 332 individuals were prosecuted under the Hunting Act. Of these, 239 were found guilty.</p>
	<p pid="b.686.4/4">The Association of Chief Police Officers has issued guidance to forces on the enforcement of the Hunting Act. This guidance reinforces the general position that the deployment of police officers, including for enforcement of the Hunting Act, is an operational matter for the police force concerned. The police, of course, have an important duty to enforce the law, but this general duty to enforce the law is subject to the normal discretion of chief constables, who are required to balance resources and priorities. The Hunting Act is no exception to this principle. It is up to the police to decide what resources they use to enforce and prioritise the Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.686.4/5">The hon. Gentleman indicated that he thought the police were perhaps neglecting this because of the absence of sufficient resources. The Government have no choice but to deal with the deficit and that means that all public services must constrain their spending. Her Majesty&#8217;s inspectorate of constabulary has made it clear that there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels, between numbers and the visibility of the police in the community, or between numbers and the quality of service provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.686.4/6">I hope that hon. Members in all parts of the House and on both sides of this passionate debate would welcome the fact that in the first two years of this Government, crime fell by 10%. On both measures of crime it is clearly falling and it is perfectly clear that the police, even with the constraints on resources, are able to do their job better than ever before. There is no argument to be made at all that resources are restricting the police from doing their basic job of cutting crime. That applies across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.686.4/7">Let me turn to the right of protest, which the hon. Gentleman rightly mentioned. I agree with him that peaceful protest is a vital part of a democratic society.</p>

	<p pid="b.687.0/1">The right to protest is not what I was talking about in relation to hunt monitors, who are engaged in a perfectly legal and lawful activity in monitoring the activities of the hunting fraternity, partly to make sure that they do not transgress the law. Indeed, evidence garnered by hunt monitors has led to numerous successful prosecutions. It is not about protest: it is about monitors being allowed to go about their lawful business.</p>

	<p pid="b.687.1/1">Indeed. I have already, I hope, enlightened the House with the number of prosecutions. If the hon. Gentleman is arguing that hunts are not being properly policed, I simply point out that there have been 332 prosecutions and in 239 of those people were found guilty. Whether he regards monitors as protestors or as something else, it is clear that the police are doing their job, as is the rest of the criminal justice system, and people are being prosecuted successfully.</p>
	<p pid="b.687.1/2">The rights of monitors, protestors, or whatever we wish to call them need to be balanced with the rights of others to go about their business without fear of intimidation or of serious disruption to the community. The police have a responsibility to assess and manage</p>
	<p pid="b.687.1/3">this balance to ensure public protection and safety, and to engage with protestors, monitors and event organisers to enable peaceful activities to take place. It is clear that on either side of this debate none of these rights extends to violent or threatening behaviour. It is not acceptable for peaceful and law-abiding people to be attacked by others for expressing their views, and the police will and do act if that happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.687.1/4">The police have a range of powers available to deal with violent crime, whether at a hunt or elsewhere. Where a violent crime has been committed or alleged, or a complaint has been made to the police, it is the responsibility of the police to investigate and determine whether there are sufficient grounds to launch a criminal investigation. The hon. Gentleman gave a number of examples, in some of which the police had clearly looked at evidence and decided that a prosecution would not be successful. That is normal police activity; it is what the police do every day. They detect more crimes than end up in court because they may well, on looking at the evidence in any type of crime, decide that perhaps a crime has not been committed or that there is not enough evidence to&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.688.0/1">The Minister sensibly mentioned the issue of intimidation. Would he like to express a view about whether it is necessary for people involved in hunt monitoring or hunt protesting to wear paramilitary gear and balaclavas? Is not that in itself intimidatory? Could the police exercise the powers they already have to make sure that people who want to protest do so in a legitimate and non-confrontational way?</p>

	<p pid="b.688.2/1">For the sake of clarity and setting the record straight, I have seen evidence&#8212;I have it here on this DVD and I have seen other footage&#8212;of hunt supporters wearing the paramilitary uniforms and balaclavas that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40151" name="Simon Hart">the hon. Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (Simon Hart)</phrase> mentioned, being extremely intimidatory and, indeed, physically assaulting hunt monitors. I hope that the Minister and the hon. Gentleman would admonish those individuals as well.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-11b.688.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="688"  time="022:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130211/debtext/130211-0004.htm#130211-0004.htm_spnew60">
	<p pid="b.688.3/1">I say to the hon. Gentleman what I have just said to my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire: I will condemn violence and intimidation wherever it comes from. We are all aware of how strongly felt the views are on this matter, but they should not lead to violence or intimidation.</p>
	<p pid="b.688.3/2">If the police have evidence of violence, intimidation or any other criminal activity, they will consult the Crown Prosecution Service, which will decide whether an offence reaches the threshold required for prosecution under the relevant legislation. The code for Crown prosecutors prohibits a prosecution from continuing if there is not a realistic prospect of conviction.</p>
	<p pid="b.688.3/3">Once criminal proceedings are brought in an individual case, it is for the courts alone to determine whether the police have acted correctly in enforcing the law and whether there is sufficient evidence to convict the defendant of the charges brought. Where a defendant is convicted, it is for the court to decide, within limits laid down in legislation, what sentence should be imposed, taking into account any aggravating or mitigating features of the case. That is a fundamental principle of our criminal justice system and no Government Minister has the power to influence the courts in the exercise of their judicial discretion&#8212;and a very good thing, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.688.3/4">On hunting more generally, this has been a highly contentious issue for many years, both in this House and among the general public. It has been brought home to me this evening, as it has on other occasions, that that remains the case. I know that the hon. Gentleman in particular is passionate about the issue, as is my hon. Friend. It is right and proper that Government and Parliament should reflect on this matter from time to time.</p>
	<p pid="b.688.3/5">I should make it clear that, while I appreciate that this is a sensitive issue that needs to be discussed from time to time, the Government are not proposing any immediate reform at this stage. We recognise the strong views held on both sides of the debate and&#8212;this point is important to the House&#8212;that it is an issue of personal conscience. Members of all parties in the House hold different views on the subject of hunting and it has traditionally, and rightly, been subject to a free vote in Parliament. I was a Member at the time of the Hunting Act and voted against it. My personal views are on the record. I should say as a declaration of non-interest that I have never been hunting in my life. Nevertheless, I voted against the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.688.3/6">The Conservative election manifesto promised that Parliament would be given the opportunity to repeal the Hunting Act on a free vote. There are many greater priorities facing the Government at the moment, but we plan to honour that commitment by tabling a motion on hunting at an appropriate time.</p>

	<p pid="b.690.2/1">I thank the Minister for giving way again. Does he agree that that commitment and the rhetoric of senior Ministers are, as I said in my speech, tantamount to tacit approval for those who are transgressing the Hunting Act to continue to do so? They may be misinterpreting them&#8212;I am sure that Ministers would not encourage people to break the law&#8212;but does the Minister not understand how the hunting fraternity might take that as tacit approval to break the Hunting Act?</p>

	<p pid="b.690.3/1">No, absolutely not. Every party at every election makes promises to change the law. Nobody takes that as tacit approval to break the law. If they did, no party would, responsibly, ever promise to change the law at any election and, therefore, there would be no point in having elections or election manifestos. As I hope the House will have observed, I am trying to steer a course, but I have to say to the hon. Gentleman that I absolutely reject his interpretation of my party&#8217;s policy at the election.</p>
	<p pid="b.690.3/2">As I have said, the time is not appropriate and we are not prioritising reform of the Hunting Act at the moment, but the right to protest peacefully and within the law is one that this Government hold dearly. Violence against those who do or do not support hunting is unacceptable. I know that the police will take appropriate action to identify and prosecute the perpetrators of violent crime, using the range of powers at their disposal to deal with any violence or unlawful activity. That is what the police should be doing, that is what the police are doing and that is what they will continue to do.</p>
