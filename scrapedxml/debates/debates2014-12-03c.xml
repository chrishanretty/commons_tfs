They can only get a place if they apply for three hours a day, five days a week at a state-run nursery school, which is useless if they work. Given that that means that parents in Wales are worse off than those in England, will the Minister speak to Assembly Ministers to ensure that parents can access their entitlement to free child care places in a way that suits them and not the Labour council?</p>

	<p pid="c.284.0/1">That is a step forward, but the Minister will be aware that good, affordable child care is key to economic development. He is probably also aware that in the UK we pay far more for child care than most other OECD countries&#8212;40.9% of the average wage compared with 18%. In Sweden, by contrast, the figure is 7.1%. Does he think that we have anything to learn from the Nordic countries in that regard?</p>

	<p pid="c.284.1/1">It is important that we learn from wherever good practice is in place. The greater choice will help to drive down costs, but it is important that we provide the right level of care, and the quality of care is important. I have no doubt that the stronger role that parents have to play in exercising that choice will also drive up the quality of care.</p>

	<p pid="c.285.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his question and his kind remarks. He is absolutely right. It was precisely because we did not want to leave those valley communities behind that we worked so hard with the Welsh Government to secure the full electrification package, electrifying the great western line all the way through to Swansea, plus electrifying those valley lines, which, as he says, will have a transformative economic and social impact for many years to come.</p>

	<p pid="c.285.3/1">The Welsh Government have published figures on proposed roads expenditure showing that spending per head of population in south-west Wales will be &#163;89, whereas the figure will be &#163;815 for south-east Wales. Carmarthenshire, Ceredigion and Swansea will not have a single penny spent on roads, which means that there will be no money for relief roads for Llandeilo, Ammanford and Pencader in my constituency, and nothing for upgrades to the link between Newcastle Emlyn and Carmarthen. Is it not the case that the stitch up between the UK Government and the Welsh Government to spend all Wales&#8217;s new borrowing capacity on a new M4 relief road means that there will be no transport infrastructure for the rest of Wales?</p>

	<p pid="c.285.4/1">With respect to the hon. Gentleman, he has got this wrong. A Plaid Cymru former Transport Minister in the Assembly championed the upgrade of the M4, but could not achieve it, because the money was not available, but we are providing the resources for that upgrade. That does not mean that no other project can happen throughout Wales, however, and I agree with the hon.

The quality of that company&#8217;s management, vision and business plan was precisely why I wanted the project to be included in the national infrastructure plan.

	<p pid="c.286.3/1">The biggest danger to Wales, including north Wales, would be to abandon our clear long-term economic plan, which I know Labour Members are calling for.

Tax receipts in Wales have fallen by &#163;2 billion since 2010, and benefit spending has gone up by &#163;1.5 billion. That has piled an extra &#163;6,000-worth of borrowing on every Welsh worker, and what have they got for it? They have got a twentyfold increase in food bank usage, the lowest wages in Wales and a cost of living crisis. The Tories have failed on the deficit, failed on the cost of living crisis, and they are failing in Wales once again.</p>

	<p pid="c.290.5/1">The shadow Secretary of State has clearly got his facts wrong. The long-term economic plan is working for Wales. If there has been a reduction in tax receipts from Wales, it is because of our increase in the personal allowance, under which next year the average worker will pay less than &#163;800 as a result, taking 155,000 people in Wales out of income tax altogether by next April.</p>

Friend and other Norwich MPs at Norwich research park to talk about the expansion of infrastructure in our country, and particularly the improvements that we are going to make to the A47, which will not just help Norwich and Norwich research park but help all of East Anglia right out to Lowestoft. I know how important it is to make sure that that important part of our country also benefits from our long-term economic plan.</p>

	<p pid="c.301.5/1" qnum="906414">Skelmersdale in my constituency is the second largest town in the north-west without a railway station&#8212;a station that would bring social and economic benefits to the town, as we have heard happened in Shrewsbury. As the Prime Minister is in spending mood, albeit a little bit further south, I wonder whether he could give the people of Skelmersdale an early Christmas present with the promise of a railway station.</p>

	<p pid="c.302.0/1">I am very happy to look at what the hon. Lady says. What we are seeing are more railway lines opening, more stations opening and more railways being electrified. In the entire period of the last Labour Government, I think they electrified just 13 miles of track&#8212;an absolutely pathetic record for a Government who had 13 years to do something about it. We now have the biggest road programme since the 1970s, the biggest rail investment programme since the Victorians and, under this Government, stations, lines and electrification are all taking place.</p>

Obviously, we want to see continued improvements at the Hereford hospital. There are pressures from people from Wales crossing the border and wanting to use services in England. That is why it is so important that the Welsh NHS has the improvements that we have been talking about. As to meetings and visits to my hon.

	Autumn Statement
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-12-03c.305.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40599" speakername="George Osborne" speakeroffice="The Chancellor of the Exchequer"  colnum="305"  time="012:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141203/debtext/141203-0001.htm#141203-0001.htm_spmin43">
	<p pid="c.305.1/1">Four years ago, in the first autumn statement of this Parliament, I presented the accounts of an economy in crisis. Today, in the last autumn statement of this Parliament, I present a forecast which shows that the United Kingdom is the fastest-growing major economy in the world. Back then, Britain was on the brink. Today, against a difficult global backdrop, I can report higher growth, lower unemployment, falling inflation, and a deficit that is falling too. Today, the deficit is half what we inherited. Our long-term economic plan is working.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/2">Now, Britain faces a choice. Do we squander the economic security that we have gained, and go back to the disastrous decisions on spending, borrowing and welfare that got us into this mess, or do we finish the job, and go on building the secure economy that works for everyone? I say: we stay the course. We stay on course for prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/3">Today, we do not shy away from the problems that remain unresolved in the British economy. Although the deficit is falling, it remains too high, so the measures that I announce today are not a net giveaway, but actually tighten the public finances a little. I could have eased up on our determination to deal with our debts; I have not.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/4">Although business investment is rising strongly, we know that there is still much more to do on productivity, so today we boost our skills, our exports, our science and our infrastructure. Although employment is at a record high, we must never give up on the task of finding work for all young people, so today we move further towards full employment by supporting the businesses that create jobs and apprenticeships. For decades our economy has been too unbalanced, so we do more now to build the northern powerhouse. And today we back aspiration&#8212;the aspiration to save, to work, and to own your own home&#8212;in stark contrast to those who would hit people&#8217;s pensions and jobs and homes with higher taxes, for that is an approach that we entirely reject. Instead, we support people who want to work hard and get on, and it is for their sakes that we resolve to stay on course for prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/5">I now turn to the report from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Let me again thank Robert Chote and his team for their hard work, and for restoring integrity and independence to our country&#8217;s economic forecasts.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/6">Since the Budget, new international statistical standards have changed the assessment of the British economy in recent years. We now know that, contrary to claims that were made at the time, there was no recession in this Parliament, and no double dip. Indeed, the only recession was the great recession under the last Labour Government. We also know that the economy has grown faster than previously reported. It is up by more than 8% over the current Parliament: that is the third fastest growth in any major advanced economy since 2010. We know, too, that growth has been more balanced. We were told that business investment had risen by 4% over this Parliament; in fact, it has risen by 27%.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/7">That is what we know about the recent past. Let us turn to the future. The warning lights are flashing over the global economy. Japan is in recession, the eurozone</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/8">is stagnating, and the geopolitical risks are rising. I can tell the House that the OBR has therefore revised down its forecast for global growth this year and in every year. It notes that the slowdown is particularly acute in our main export markets, such as Europe, where growth is a full 1% lower this year than previously forecast. It makes it even more imperative that we connect British firms to the faster growing emerging economies of Africa, Asia and south America. Today I am providing a &#163;45 million package to do that and to provide new support to first-time exporters.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/9">As one of the most open trading economies in the world, with a large financial sector, Britain cannot be immune to the risks in the global economy, but nor are we powerless&#8212;provided we go on working through our plan to put our own house in order.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/10">That brings me to today&#8217;s forecast. In the Budget, I reported that the OBR had revised up its forecasts for growth this year. A year ago, we expected GDP to grow by 2.4%. In March we expected 2.7%. Today, the British economy is forecast to grow by 3%. Over the last year we have grown two and half times faster than Germany; over three times faster than the eurozone; and over seven times faster than France. I think we can safely reject the advice of those in this House who told us on the steps of the &#201;lys&#233;e palace that we should be doing to Britain what has been done to France.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/11">Growth in the UK next year is also forecast a little higher at 2.4%, with quarterly growth moderating as it returns to trend, then 2.2% in 2016, 2.4% the year after, then 2.3% in 2018 and 2019, and the growth we are now seeing is more balanced. Manufacturing is growing faster than any other sector, and investment is set to be up 11% this year&#8212;growing faster in the UK than in any other major advanced economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/12">This balanced growth is creating jobs, too, with a record number in work. At the Budget, the OBR expected that over the last year employment would rise by 265,000. Today, I can tell the House that it doubles that number. Over the last year, half a million new jobs have been created. In March, it forecast that in the first three quarters of the year the number claiming unemployment benefit would fall by 7%. Today, it says that it actually fell by 23%. The number of young people on long-term unemployment benefit has almost halved in the last year alone. Unemployment is revised down in every single year of the OBR forecast, falling from the 8% we inherited to 5.4% next year, before settling at 5.3%.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/13">On average, for every day this Government have been in office, 1,000 new jobs have been created, 1,000 new opportunities for people, new economic security for 1,000 families every single day. Britain&#8217;s long-term economic plan is working.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/14">In response to the caricature that some like to draw&#8212;that these jobs are being created only in London, that they are part time with women losing out&#8212;I say, look at the facts. How many of the jobs being created are full-time? Eighty-five per cent. Where are the jobs being created fastest right now? In Scotland and in the north of England. What is happening to the gender pay gap? It has just fallen to its lowest level in the entire history of this country. That is progressive politics in action.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/15">Regular earnings growth is now faster than inflation. For those in full-time work for over a year, earnings grew 4% over the last year. The compositional effect of</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/16">many more people finding work, particularly young people, is weighing down on overall average earnings, but the OBR today predicts that &#8220;meaningful real wage growth&#8221; will pick up through next year and grow above inflation for the next five years. Indeed, I can tell the House that GDP per capita has grown faster on average in this Parliament than over the last two Parliaments combined.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/17">Living standards are also supported by our robust monetary policy arrangements with the Bank of England. Today, there is welcome news that the OBR has significantly revised down its forecast for inflation: it is expected to be down to 1.5% this year, 1.2% next year and 1.7% the year after, before it returns to target. So we have lower inflation, lower unemployment and higher growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.305.1/18">That brings me to the forecasts for debt and deficit. There are those in this House who have been predicting from the Opposition Dispatch Box in recent weeks that I would have to announce today that the deficit was rising and that borrowing this year would be higher than last year. We discover today&#8212;I am afraid not for the first time&#8212;that their predictions are wrong: the deficit is falling this year and every year, and, not only that, but in the final four years of the forecast, borrowing is actually lower than predicted in the Budget. <i>[Interruption.] </i>The Office for National Statistics has made revisions to the way the national accounts are measured&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]&#8212;</i>and one of the advantages of having created an independent OBR is that it has ensured that the figures presented today are comparable on a like-for-like basis with the forecast made in the Budget. <i>[Interruption.] </i>On this revised basis, the forecast at the Budget would have shown borrowing falling from the &#163;150 billion we inherited to &#163;99.3 billion last year, &#163;86.4 billion this year, &#163;68.3 billion next year, then &#163;41.5 billion, &#163;15.8 billion, and then a small surplus of &#163;3.7 billion in 2018-19. <i>[Interruption.] </i>That is the Budget forecast.<i>[Interruption.]</i> Today&#8217;s forecast shows borrowing falling from &#163;97.5 billion last year to &#163;91.3 billion this year, then &#163;75.9 billion next year, then &#163;40.9 billion, &#163;14.5 billion, and then a surplus of &#163;4 billion in 2018-19. So borrowing falls every year. It falls slightly less than expected in the first two years, but then falls slightly more than expected in the four years after that. <i>[Interruption.] </i>We end in a marginally stronger position than expected at the Budget, and I can tell the House that by 2019-20 Britain is now predicted to have a &#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="c.307.0/1">Order. There is now excessive noise in the Chamber. The Chancellor should not have to shout in order to make himself heard, and to some degree he is having to do so at the moment, and that is not right.

	<p pid="c.307.1/1">I can tell the House that by 2019-20 Britain is now predicted to have a surplus of &#163;23 billion&#8212;out of the red and into the black for the first time in a generation, a country that inspires confidence around the world because it seeks to live within its means.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/2">As a percentage of GDP, today the deficit is also forecast to fall this year, down by 0.6% of GDP&#8212;down from what the OBR describes today in its own report as</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/3">&#8220;the post-war record deficit of 10.2% of GDP&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/4">in 2009-10 to 5% this year. The deficit is no longer down by a third, but is now cut in half. It is still too high, but with our plan it falls again to 4% next year, then 2.1%, then 0.7% before we move into surpluses of 0.2% and 1% of GDP. The structural deficit also falls and moves into surplus at the same pace over the next five years, as forecast at the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/5">We continue to meet the debt mandate a year late and the fiscal mandate two years early. Again, because of the statistical revisions and the reclassification of Network Rail&#8212;given that Labour tried to put it off balance sheet&#8212;the OBR has given us a like-for-like comparison on debt as a share of GDP. On the new basis, it is 80.4% this year, next year it peaks at 81.1% &#8212;half a per cent. lower than previously forecast at the Budget&#8212;and it is then lower in every subsequent year, at 80.7% in 2016-17, 78.8% the year after, then 76.2%, before reaching 72.8% in 2019-20. Again, this is less than was forecast at the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/6">Borrowing is falling. The deficit is down this year to half what we inherited. Debt is falling in the same year predicted, and lower in every year thereafter. There will be a surplus that is higher and by the end of the period worth &#163;23 billion. Britain is back living within its means. Our long-term economic plan is on course.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/7">The House will want to know why the public finance numbers are much better than some were predicting, even though tax receipts have deteriorated. The answer is that we cannot look at taxes alone; we have to look at spending, too. As has been widely reported, tax receipts have not been rising as quickly as the OBR had previously predicted. The OBR now forecasts that revenues will be &#163;23 billion lower by 2017-18. However, that is more than offset by three things. First, we are paying less in welfare and saving money on public service pensions because of lower inflation and more people being in work. That saves &#163;4 billion a year.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/8">Secondly, the revisions to our national accounts have slightly increased the measured rate of spending cuts in this Parliament. We have a choice: we can ease up, or we can continue with our plans. Our policy of continuing the spending cuts in the first two full years of the next Parliament, at the same pace as we achieved in this Parliament, now produces &#163;4 billion less spending. Thirdly, and crucially, the interest we pay on our national debt is &#163;16 billion lower in that year. That is, by a large margin, the biggest saving and demonstrates the value of our fiscal credibility around the world. Some have pointed to lower tax receipts and put forward policies for higher taxes. I prefer lower tax receipts offset by lower debt interest payments, and that is what we are seeing today.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/9">I do not hide from the House that in the coming years there are going to have to be very substantial savings in public spending. Next week we will publish a new charter for budget responsibility that will reinforce our commitment to finish the job in the next Parliament, and we will ask the House to vote on it in the new year. However, no charter, valuable as it is, can be a substitute for the hard work of identifying real savings in the cost of government and delivering them in practice. That is what we have done in this Parliament, and it is what we will have to do in the next.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/10">The work starts with our spending plans for 2015-16, which save &#163;13.6 billion. We have published the detailed and specific departmental proposals that will achieve them. There will be two further years where decisions</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/11">on this scale will be required and, as I have said before, we are going to have to go on controlling spending after those years if we want to have a surplus and keep it. Of course, people are already saying it will be impossible to achieve those levels of savings. We heard exactly the same thing in 2010, often from exactly the same people. In fact, we have come in under budget every year of this Parliament. This year I can confirm that we will be spending &#163;10 billion less than set out in our original spending plans.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/12">There are those who say we should cut even faster, and those who say we should cut more slowly. But we have got the pace right, as is clearly demonstrated by the fact that our economy is growing faster than almost any other. And because of careful management, we can afford to put part of that underspend money into our national health service to cope with the pressures it faces: &#163;2 billion every year to the front line of the NHS&#8212;not money that busts our plans, but extra money that is available because we have a plan. Instead of returning the foreign exchange fines paid by the banks to the City, as happened under the previous Government, we are using that windfall for a &#163;1.2 billion investment in GP services across the UK. That is a down-payment on the NHS&#8217;s own plan, proving definitively for anyone in any doubt that we cannot have a strong NHS without a strong economy. I can also tell the House that we will help with the employment of carers, who do so much, by extending the &#163;2,000 employment allowance to include them.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/13">We have shown in this Parliament that we can deliver spending reductions without damaging front-line public services if we are prepared to undertake reform. Crime is down. Satisfaction with local government services is up. Savings and reform&#8212;and we will do exactly the same again. Continuing to reduce departmental spending in the first two years of the next Parliament would mean at least &#163;15 billion off Whitehall budgets. Our control of public sector pay in the past four years has delivered &#163;12 billion of savings. By continuing to restrain public sector pay, we expect to deliver commensurate savings in the next Parliament until we have dealt with the deficit. Today I can confirm that we are committing to complete the public service pension reforms proposed by Lord Hutton, bringing total savings of &#163;1.3 billion a year. Administration costs in Whitehall are already down 40% over this Parliament. Today, the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40322" name="Francis Maude">the Member for Horsham (Mr Maude)</phrase>, is publishing a plan for a further &#163;10 billion of efficiencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/14">I am also confident that in the next Parliament we can continue to crack down on tax avoidance and evasion, and aggressive tax planning. Doing so at the same rate as in this Parliament would raise at least another &#163;5 billion, and today I commit to delivering that. Then there is the new welfare cap that we have introduced to control the one sixth of public spending that was subject to absolutely no control at all. The OBR today reports that</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/15">&#8220;the Government is on track to meet the welfare cap commitment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/16">Today we undertake further steps to control benefit spending by freezing universal credit work allowances for a further year, cutting tax credits when overpayments are certain, and ending unemployment benefits for migrants</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/17">with no prospect of work. Total welfare spending is now set to be &#163;1 billion a year lower than forecast at the Budget and it will go on falling as a share of our GDP. And, as I have made clear, I believe that we need to freeze working-age benefits for two years, saving billions more.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/18">Decisions to control public spending are never easy, but the impact on people&#8217;s lives when economic stability is lost is far, far greater. I have always believed that we should be straight about what is required to restore stability and what is required to stay on course. Our task is made easier by the deal we secured for this country when we got the European Union budget cut. Some people claimed that our payments to the European Union would go up this year. Instead, I can confirm that the OBR&#8217;s forecast today shows Britain&#8217;s net payments to the EU falling by around &#163;1 billion for this year and next year, and falling in real terms over the next five years. That is the dividend we receive thanks to a Prime Minister who fights hard for our national financial interest in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/19">Another bill that has gone down is the cost of our overseas military operations. The end of our operations in Afghanistan allows us to save an additional &#163;200 million this year from the special military reserve. I join the rest of the House in saluting the brave men and women of our armed services who for more than a decade have risked their lives for our security in Iraq and Afghanistan. Even as we speak, they are tackling the horrific Ebola virus in west Africa, a fight that reminds us all of the value of Britain&#8217;s commitment to 0.7% in development aid. Today I am extending our inheritance tax exemption to cover our aid workers who lose their lives in dealing with humanitarian emergencies. LIBOR fines will continue to support our military and emergency service charities with support for our armed services benevolent charities and the Ghurkhas and &#163;10 million for veterans with hearing problems. We will ensure that the first world war continues to be properly commemorated, and this morning I have announced we will repay the entire outstanding national debt incurred to fight the first world war.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/20">We will extend the cathedral renovation fund to cover repairs to our country&#8217;s churches. Thanks to the brilliant campaigns run by my hon. Friends the Members for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Jack Lopresti) and for Bristol North West (Charlotte Leslie) and others, we will use the LIBOR money for new helicopters for the Great Western air ambulance, and the Kent, Surrey and Sussex air ambulance, too. I will go further and refund VAT for our search and rescue and air ambulance organisations across the UK. Our hospice charities also make an enormous contribution to our communities. They have long been subject to unfair rules that force them to pay VAT, when the NHS does not. I am today refunding the VAT that these hospice charities incur.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/21">I turn now from those who have paid too much tax to some of those who have paid too little. First, we will make sure that big multinational businesses pay their fair share. Some of the largest companies in the world, including those in the tech sector, use elaborate structures to avoid paying taxes. Today, I am introducing a 25% tax on profits generated by multinationals from economic activity here in the UK which they then artificially shift out of the country; that is not fair to other British firms and it is not fair to the British people either&#8212;today, we</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/22">are putting a stop to it. My message is consistent and clear: low taxes; but low taxes that will be paid. Britain has led the world on this agenda and we do so again today. This new diverted profits tax will raise more than &#163;1 billion over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/23">Secondly, I am taking action today to make sure that our banks pay their fair share, too. Under the rules we inherited, banks can offset all their losses from the financial crisis against tax on profits for years to come. Some banks would not be paying tax for 15 or 20 years, which is totally unacceptable. The banks got public support in the crisis and they should now support the public in the recovery. I am today limiting the amount of profit in established banks that can be offset by losses carried forward to 50%, and delaying relief on bad debts, which together will mean that banks contribute almost &#163;4 billion more in tax over the next five years. We will also put in place internationally recognised measures on hybrids and the reporting of tax by country.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/24">That is multinationals and banks paying their fair share, and so should people aggressively trying to avoid their tax&#8212;that is the third step. I am taking measures to prevent the disguising of fee income by investment managers; the avoidance of tax through special purpose share schemes, miscellaneous losses and payments of benefits in lieu of salary; the avoidance of stamp duty on takeovers; and unfair benefits from the transfer of some intangible assets on incorporation. Those measures and others set out in the document raise &#163;2.8 billion. We are also consulting on other measures, including the use of so called &#8220;umbrella companies&#8221; to deprive people of basic employment rights such as the minimum wage, and, as a result, to avoid tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/25">Fourthly, I want to preserve the non-dom status that makes our country attractive, but I want these people to pay a fair contribution while having certainty about their future arrangements. In the next Parliament, the &#163;30,000 annual charge will remain unchanged, but those who have been here for 12 of the last 14 years will see their payment rise to &#163;60,000; and I am introducing a new &#163;90,000 charge for those resident in this country for 17 of the past 20 years. To tackle the continued use of enveloped properties to avoid stamp duty, I am increasing the new annual charge by 50% above inflation on properties worth over &#163;2 million. All these tax measures I have announced amount to &#163;9 billion over the next five years The distributional analysis the Treasury publishes today shows that the decisions across this Parliament mean that the rich are making the biggest contribution to deficit reduction. In fact, the net contribution of the richest 20% will be larger than that of the remaining 80% put together, proving that we are all in this together.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/26">We will make further reductions in Government spending and welfare, and we will make sure taxes are paid, but ultimately our future living standards depend on Britain earning its way in the world, so we must increase our productivity. Today, we take steps to back business, support science and invest in infrastructure. This Government have succeeded in making Britain the most entrepreneurial economy in Europe, and today we want to go further. To ensure that our growing smaller businesses have access to credit, we will expand the British business bank and act to encourage peer-to-peer lending. With the Governor of the Bank of England, I am extending the funding for lending scheme by a further year and focusing it exclusively on smaller firms. We will strengthen</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/27">entrepreneurs&#8217; relief and the social investment tax relief. We will accept almost all the recommendations of the Office of Tax Simplification to reduce the administrative burden on firms, and I thank Michael Jack and John Whiting for their work.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/28">Our tax breaks have ushered in a golden age for Britain&#8217;s creative industries as well. Today, we will extend our new theatre tax break to orchestras; and we will help one area of television production that has been in decline, with a new children&#8217;s television credit, alongside our new animation credit. I know that the whole House has been saddened to hear that Wallace and Gromit may no longer be produced because the man behind Wallace&#8217;s voice has retired, but after next May I am sure the whole House will unite behind a suitable and by then available candidate.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/29">We also want to help British businesses do more research and development&#8212;that is crucial to our productivity. Today, I am increasing the R and D tax credit for small and medium companies to 230% and the credit for larger firms to 11%. This Government have repeatedly helped small business deal with the burden of business rates and we do so again today. We will double small business rate relief for yet another year. The last Government were going to close it, but it benefits half a million firms and means a third of a million firms pay no rates, and we are going to continue to fund it. I will also continue to cap the inflation-linked increase in business rates at 2%. I am also announcing a full review of the structure of business rates, and I urge business groups to engage with us on that. Last year, to help our high street shops, pubs and cafes, I introduced a new &#163;1,000 discount on their rates. With the brilliant small business Saturday this weekend, I am increasing that help for the high street by 50%, to &#163;1,500 next year.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/30">The fall in the global oil price has meant a welcome boost to much of the British economy and to families. There is record investment this year in the North sea, but the lower oil price clearly presents a challenge to this vital industry. My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury will set out our full proposals in Aberdeen tomorrow, but I can tell the House today that we will go ahead with an immediate reduction in the rate of the supplementary charge from 32% to 30%; we will expand the ring-fenced expenditure supplement from six to 10 years; and we are introducing, with immediate effect, a new cluster area allowance. That demonstrates our commitment to the tens of thousands of jobs that depend on this great British industry. Despite falling fuel prices, let me make this absolutely clear: we have cut fuel duty and we will keep it frozen&#8212;with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40298" name="Robert Halfon">the Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon)</phrase> sitting right behind me, I would not dare do anything else. Just as we demand that falls in oil prices should be passed on to people at the pumps, other fuel price surcharges should also come down. We are going to require airlines to list the charges separately from the taxes on tickets, but I also want to reduce the cost of those tickets for families directly. My hon. Friends the Members for Altrincham and Sale West (Mr Brady) and for North West Leicestershire (Andrew Bridgen), and many others, have asked me to help reduce air passenger duty for children on economy flights, so from <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-01">1 May</phrase> next year APD for children under 12 will be abolished. I will go further than they asked: from the following year, we will get rid of APD for children under 16 altogether.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/31">Improving productivity for all businesses also demands a major investment in our nation&#8217;s infrastructure. Because we have controlled our day-to-day spending, I can confirm that we will invest more as a share of our GDP over this Parliament and the next than was achieved under the whole period of the last Labour Government. This week we have set out plans for the biggest road building programme for a generation. We have committed billions to our flood defences, and today I take forward the recommendation of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40638" name="Peter Aldous">the Member for Waveney (Peter Aldous)</phrase> and expand tax relief on business investment in those flood defences, too. It is all brought together in the national infrastructure plan, which is now helping our country attract more investment from around the world than any other single country in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/32">Britain is raising its ambition, and nowhere is that clearer than in our commitment to science. It is a personal priority of mine as Chancellor. Scientific advance is a human endeavour worthy of support in its own right, but it is also crucial to our economic future. When this Government came into office, the UK was ranked 14th in the global innovation index&#8212;today, we are ranked second. But we aim to be the best. A year ago, I abolished the arbitrary cap on the total number of undergraduates at our universities. Today, I am going to revolutionise the support for our postgraduate students, too. Until now, there has been almost no financial support available, and the up-front costs of postgraduate degrees deter bright students from poorer backgrounds. Today, across all disciplines, we will make Government-backed student loans of up to &#163;10,000 available, for the first time ever, to all young people undertaking postgraduate masters degrees.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/33">The next step is the allocation of &#163;6 billion on the biggest-ever sustained programme of investment in the research facilities of our scientific community. This includes money for major new scientific challenges, including the search for advanced materials, ground-breaking work on ageing and the exploration of the universe. The Rosetta comet mission captured the nation&#8217;s imagination. I can tell the House that, yesterday, Britain was awarded the lead role in the next international effort to explore the planet of Mars. We on the Government Benches have often gazed at the barren and desolate wastelands of the red planet, and we have long given up hope of finding intelligent life there, but signs of any life at all would be a major advance.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/34">Many of the new science investments will be made in the north of England. One of the great challenges of this country is to create a more balanced national economy&#8212;a challenge that has eluded Governments for generations. Our ambition is to build a northern powerhouse as a complement to the strength of our capital city, bringing together our great cities of the north. Since I set out that ambition less than six months ago, we have proposed, reported on, and given the green light to the concept of High Speed 3. This week, we commit billions of pounds to other road and rail improvements across the whole of the north of England. I can today confirm that we will tender for new franchises for Northern Rail and the TransPennine Express, replacing the ancient and unpopular Pacer carriages with new and modern trains.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/35">When I set out the ingredients of a northern powerhouse, I promised to make progress. Today, I deliver. A few months ago, there were no proposals for major scientific institutions in the north of England. Today, we commit to a massive quarter of a billion investment in a new Sir Henry Royce Institute for advanced materials science in Manchester, with branches in Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield. We back the brilliant work on ageing being conducted at Newcastle university, and big data computing at Hartree.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/36">We are also committing to the industry of the north, with investment in new high-value manufacturing research. We are supporting new academy schools, and we are announcing a new sovereign wealth fund for the north of England so that the shale gas resources of the north are used to invest in the future of the north. The cultural life of the north will get a boost too, including a major new theatre space in Manchester. Manchester city council proposes to call it the Factory Manchester. Anyone who is a child of the &#8216;80s will think that that is a great idea.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/37">Six months ago, people would have said it was completely impossible to get the 10 local authorities of Greater Manchester to come together with the Government to agree a major devolution of power to the city and the creation of a new directly elected mayor. We have delivered in Manchester, and my door is open to other cities who want to follow its cross-party lead. I said that I had put the northern powerhouse at the heart of this autumn statement, and with billions of investment in science, transport and new civic power in our great northern cities, that is exactly what we have done this week. We show today what can be achieved if we have the determination and ambition to deliver a truly national recovery.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/38">We will also respect and fully implement the devolution settlements across the nations of our United Kingdom. Today, I announce that we recognise the strongly held arguments for devolving corporation tax-setting powers to Northern Ireland. The Treasury believes it can be implemented provided that the Northern Ireland Executive can show that they are able to manage the financial implications. The current talks will see whether that is the case. If it is, the Government will introduce legislation in this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/39">In Wales, we are working towards a cross-party agreement on further powers for next March. I confirm today that we have reached agreement with the Welsh Government on the full devolution of business rates. This is a great opportunity to grow the Welsh economy. Last week, the Government supported the proposals of Lord Smith&#8217;s commission on Scotland. They will lead to the devolution of income tax rates and thresholds and other powers and ensure that the Scottish Government are responsible not just for spending money but for raising the taxes to pay for it. We will publish the draft clauses in the new year. The sheer scale of the devolution to Scotland now makes unanswerable the case for English votes for English laws.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/40">To improve the productivity of our economy, we back business, build infrastructure and support growth across the whole UK. But in the end, Britain&#8217;s future lies in the hands of its people and their aspirations&#8212;aspirations to save, to work and to buy a home. Today we support each one.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/41">First, on saving, from next April, we will trust people with control over their own pensions. In this autumn statement, I confirm that the 55% death tax that currently applies when a person passes an unused pension pot on to their loved ones will be abolished. People will be able to pass on their pensions to their loved ones tax free. I can also tell the House today that we will ensure that people who die before the age of 75 with a joint life or guaranteed-term annuity can pass that on tax free, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/42">Next week, we will publish the market-leading rates on our new 65-plus pensioner bonds, which will be available from January. Our &#163;15,000 new individual savings accounts are hugely popular with savers, too. Next April, we will increase the limit to &#163;15,240. But we will do something more. At the moment, when someone dies, the savings in their ISA lose their tax-free status and their spouse starts paying tax on that money. From today, I can announce that when someone dies, their husband or wife will be able to inherit their ISA and keep its tax-free status. Pass on your ISA tax free and pass on your pension tax free. We are delivering fairness to savers and to those who aspire to work, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/43">The number of young people on unemployment benefits has halved. Our goal is to abolish youth unemployment all together. To support businesses that take on young people, we are already, from next April, abolishing national insurance contributions for employing anyone under the age of 21. Today, I can go further. Under this Government, almost 2 million people have taken up an apprenticeship. The Prime Minister has set this country an ambition of 3 million apprentices in the next Parliament. We back the businesses that employ apprentices, especially young apprentices under the age of 25.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/44">At the moment, we charge national insurance on businesses that employ apprentices. Today, I can announce that the jobs tax on young apprentices will be abolished altogether. When a business gives a young person a chance in life, we will support them, not tax them.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/45">We also back people of all ages in work, which is why the Government have raised the tax-free personal allowance to &#163;10,000. Next year, the tax-free personal allowance, which was set to rise to &#163;10,500, will rise instead to &#163;10,600. That is a total wage boost for working people of &#163;825 a year. It means that 3.5 million of the lowest paid will now be taken out of tax altogether. That shows that we on the Government Benches do not sneer at people who want to work hard and get on. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I just wanted to flag that up.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/46">It is the first step to the new goal that we have set of raising the personal allowance to &#163;12,500 so that people working full time on the minimum wage pay no tax at all. Today, I can also announce that, unlike previous increases in the personal allowance threshold, this increase will be passed on in full to higher-rate taxpayers paying 40% tax. So the higher-rate threshold goes from &#163;41,865 this year to &#163;42,385 next year. That is the first increase in the higher threshold in line with inflation for five years. This year&#8217;s increase means that 138,000 fewer people will pay the higher rate than would otherwise be the case. It is a down-payment on our commitment to raise the higher-rate threshold to &#163;50,000 by the end of the decade.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/47">There are those who have said that it was impossible to control public spending, improve public services, reduce the deficit and still cut income taxes for hard-working families on low and middle incomes. Today, we have</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/48">settled that argument: it is possible, provided that we hold to our long-term economic plan, and we are doing it.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/49">I turn now to my final measure. As well as the aspiration to work and to save, there is the aspiration to own our own home. Today, I am announcing the complete reform of a tax that has been described as one of our worst designed and most damaging. Stamp duty is charged at a single slab rate on the whole purchase price of a home. It means big jumps in tax when house values tip into a new band. The distortions can be particularly damaging at the lower end: someone buying a property worth &#163;250,000 pays &#163;2,500 in tax, but if they buy a house worth just &#163;1 more, they pay over &#163;7,500&#8212;three times as much. In recent years, the burden of stamp duty has increased on low and middle-income families trying to buy a new home as prices have risen. That makes it even more difficult to get together the cash deposits that buyers need. It is time that we fundamentally changed this badly designed tax on aspiration, so I am today abolishing the residential slab system altogether. In future, each rate will apply only to the part of the property price that falls within that band, like income tax.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/50">Here are the new marginal rates: you will pay no tax on the first &#163;125,000 paid; and then 2% on the portion up to &#163;250,000; 5% up to &#163;925,000; 10% up to &#163;1.5 million; and 12% on everything over that. As a result, stamp duty will be cut for 98% of home buyers who pay it. Someone buying an averagely priced house of &#163;275,000 will pay &#163;4,500 less in tax. The average home in London will see a similar reduction. As I said, 98% will pay less, and the whole reform represents a tax cut of &#163;800 million per year. Only homes that cost just over &#163;937,000 will see their stamp duty bill go up under this system&#8212;gradually to start with, rising to more substantial sums for the most expensive homes. A &#163;5 million house will see its stamp duty rise from &#163;350,000 to &#163;514,000, but, of course, this is a charge that is paid only once, when the property is bought.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/51">I can tell the House that these changes to stamp duty become effective from midnight tonight. Anyone who has exchanged contracts but not completed by midnight will be able to choose whether to pay under the old system or the new, so no one in the middle of moving house will lose out. The changes will apply in Scotland until the Scottish Government&#8217;s new regime comes into effect next April. At the end of the statement, I will move a motion to introduce this. There will be a debate tomorrow and legislation will follow.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/52">There has been a debate in this country about taxing houses. The system that I introduce today replaces a badly designed system that has distorted our housing market for decades. It reduces stamp taxes for 98% of people who pay them in this country. It increases the taxes on the most expensive 2% of homes, but asks people to pay that tax only when they buy the house and they have the money. It does not involve a revaluation of hundreds of thousands of homes in this country. Today I am cutting stamp duty for millions of home buyers in this country&#8212;98% will be better off. That is a fair, workable, lasting reform of the taxation of housing, and it is in stark contrast to the shambles of the anti-aspirational, unworkable homes tax that the Labour party wants to impose.</p>
	<p pid="c.307.1/53">Four and a half years ago, our economy was in crisis. People questioned whether Britain could remain among the front-rank economic nations of the world, but we set a course to restore stability, to get on top of our debts and to show that Britain was not going to be counted out. Through the storm we have stayed the course. Now Britain is on course for surplus, on course for lower taxes, on course for more jobs, on course for higher growth and on course for a truly national recovery&#8212;a long-term economic plan on course to prosperity.</p>

	<p pid="c.317.4/2">First, on living standards&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> These questions about living standards, wages and tax receipts are important, so I advise Conservative Members to listen to them carefully, and then we will hear the answers.</p>
	<p pid="c.317.4/3">Wages have not kept pace with prices for 52 of the past 53 months. Today&#8217;s OBR forecasts confirm that wage growth is once again weaker than expected. Working people are now &#163;1,600 a year worse off than in 2010. Someone in full-time work is now &#163;2,000 a year worse off. For working people, there is a cost of living crisis, and the squeeze on living standards not only is hitting family budgets, but has led to a shortfall in tax revenues. The OBR confirms that stagnant wages and low-paid employment have hit revenues, saying that</p>
	<p pid="c.317.4/4">&#8220;weaker-than-expected wage growth so far in 2014-15&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.317.4/5">is</p>
	<p pid="c.317.4/6">&#8220;depressing PAYE and NIC receipts.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.317.4/7">Does the Chancellor agree with the OBR&#8217;s analysis? Will he tell us how much tax revenue has been lost this year because of stagnating wages and forced part-time employment?</p>
	<p pid="c.317.4/8">The result of that shortfall in tax revenues is that, once again, the Chancellor has had to revise up his forecasts for Government borrowing. He told the House today that the deficit for this fiscal year is now expected to be &#163;91.3 billion&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="c.318.1/1">I am trying to establish the facts about the deficit from the Chancellor. He told the House that the deficit for this fiscal year is now expected to be &#163;91.3 billion, but he did not set out in detail how much worse things are since the Budget. Will he tell the House by how much borrowing this year has been revised up compared with his Budget forecast?</p>
	<p pid="c.318.1/2">Back in 2010, the Chancellor and the Prime Minister pledged to balance the budget by the end of this Parliament and that we would see the national debt falling this year. The Prime Minister said in 2010:</p>
	<p pid="c.318.1/3">&#8220;In five years&#8217; time, we will have balanced the books.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.318.1/4">Today the Chancellor has, I believe, announced that the deficit next year is forecast to be &#163;75.9 billion. Will he confirm that number and the fact that the national debt next year is forecast not to fall, but to rise? While he has clearly missed his targets, he did not tell us the scale by which he has missed them. How much more will he have borrowed in this Parliament than he planned back in 2010?</p>
	<p pid="c.318.1/5">Wages, income and borrowing have been hit so hard because productivity growth has been so weak. Today the Chancellor announced that he is forecasting that growth will not accelerate but&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>The Prime Minister&#8217;s Parliamentary Private Secretary will be interested to know that the Chancellor forecasts that growth next year will slow down. I know that the Chancellor wants to blame poor growth performance and poor productivity growth on the eurozone. I share the concerns about the eurozone&#8212;we need a plan for stronger growth in Germany and across the continent&#8212;but the weakness of the eurozone cannot explain why, despite the notable successes of a number of our companies, our export performance has been so poor, and so much worse than that of other eurozone countries. Since 2010, our export performance has been 16th in the G20. In the EU, we have been 22nd out of 28 countries; three quarters of EU countries have done better than us.</p>
	<p pid="c.318.1/6">Business investment, which has also lagged behind that of our competitors, fell in the last quarter. Bank lending to small businesses is falling. The number of apprenticeships for young people is falling this year. House building under this Government is at its lowest level since the &#8217;20s. On infrastructure, for all the Chancellor&#8217;s preheated re-announcements, barely a fifth of projects are in construction, and infrastructure output is down over 11% since 2010.</p>
	<p pid="c.318.1/7">On business rates, the research and development tax credit and air passenger duty, we welcome the action that the Chancellor has taken. We will support what he has proposed on APD, but let me ask him&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="c.319.0/1">Order. There is far too much noise in the Chamber. Mr Opperman, I have told you three times, and I do not want to have to tell you again: be quiet, sit and listen. If you do not wish to do so, get out. The same goes for the Government&#8217;s Deputy Chief Whip, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40162" name="Greg Hands">the right hon.

	<p pid="c.319.1/1">We&#8217;ll get him out next year, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/2">I would like to ask the Chancellor about the air passenger duty proposal. We will support what he has proposed, but following the Smith commission proposal to devolve air passenger duty to Scotland, will the Chancellor urgently lead work across Government, with the Scottish Government, on a mechanism to ensure that English airports, particularly in the north of England, are not disadvantaged by that devolution?</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/3">On business rates, while the review is welcome, it will not report, I believe, until 2016. Why can the Chancellor not take immediate action and adopt our plan to cut business rates for small companies? Why will he not increase the bank levy now and increase free child care for working people? Why will he not properly capitalise the business investment bank? Why will he not raise, as a proportion of earnings, the national minimum wage? Why will he not repeat the bank bonus tax and guarantee a compulsory job for all people? On regional devolution, why will he not devolve full growth in business rates to all city and county regions, to give them real control? We need a real plan for good jobs and more balanced growth.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/4">On the subject of growth, the figures that the Chancellor announced reveal that growth has been revised downwards in 2016 from 2.6% to 2.2%, in 2017 from 2.6% to 2.4%, and in 2018 from 2.7% to 2.3%. Why is growth being revised downwards year after year? This is an interesting fact from the OBR: if our economy grew by just 0.5% a year faster than forecast, Government borrowing would come in more than &#163;32 billion lower in the next Parliament. Does the Chancellor not see that those downgrades to growth are bad news? Without decisive action to sustain growth and raise living standards, and without a recovery for the many, not the few, he will carry on missing his deficit targets year after year.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/5">Let me ask the Chancellor about another missed target. Over the past 12 months, net migration to the United Kingdom has been 260,000 people. Can he tell the House&#8212;this will be an interesting question to many Back Benchers in all parts of the House&#8212;the OBR estimate for net migration over the next 12 months that underpins the growth and public finance forecasts? It seems highly unlikely that it will be anywhere near the Prime Minister&#8217;s forecast, which is for tens of thousands. Will it be over 100,000 next year? Over 150,000? Over 200,000? This time, did the Chancellor remember to tell the Prime Minister the facts?</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/6">Turning to spending and taxation, the Prime Minister claimed in <i>The Times </i>a month ago that 80% of the planned spending cuts had been made. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that it is less than 50%. Can the Chancellor clarify who is right and who is wrong? He claims that in the next Parliament he can cut welfare spending by over &#163;10 billion, but in this Parliament, spending on social security is over &#163;20 billion higher</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/7">than he planned in 2010 because of what happened to housing benefit in particular. He is planning a &#163;3 billion real-terms cut in tax credits that will hit 3 million working people on middle and lower incomes, and once again he is hitting women harder than men.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/8">The Prime Minister rather let the cat out of the bag earlier when he referred to &#8220;masosadism&#8221;. As I understand it, masosadism is when someone enjoys having pain inflicted on them and enjoys inflicting pain on other people. We know the Chancellor&#8217;s views on the first; it seems, from the way he smiled when he announced the tax credits cuts, that he is rather enjoying the second as well. How can it be fair to hit working people with a &#163;3 billion cut to their tax credits when he has spent &#163;3 billion giving a tax cut to people earning over &#163;150,000?</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/9">When families are paying &#163;450 more in higher VAT, does the Chancellor really think that people will fall for the Prime Minister&#8217;s latest promise of a &#163;7 billion unfunded tax cut in the next Parliament, which even the Business Secretary has called a &#8220;fantasy&#8221;? Two months on, the Chancellor gave us no details at all of where he will get the money from&#8212;not a single penny. Is he planning to pay for that with a further rise in VAT? He said at the weekend that he has no plans to raise VAT. That is what he said before the last general election, and then he raised it after the election. He should stand at the Dispatch Box today and promise that he will not raise VAT again for families and pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/10">On the national health service, we welcome the Chancellor&#8217;s belated recognition that there is a funding crisis. Everyone knows&#8212;other than the Prime Minister, it seems&#8212;that our health service is going backwards. Accident and emergency department waiting times and GP waiting times are going up, thanks to the Government&#8217;s &#163;3 billion reckless reorganisation. The Chancellor announced &#163;2 billion for, he said, every year into the future&#8212;paid, it seems, by an underspend every year into the future. I have never heard of a prospective forecast of an underspend being made in quite that way. Will he confirm that that is &#163;2 billion a year for the national health service over a flat, real baseline? We need to know the answer to that one. It seems that the Chancellor has also confirmed that &#163;700 million of the crisis cash is a re-announcement of a re-allocation from within the existing Department of Health budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/11">In the Chancellor&#8217;s stamp duty reforms, he is accepting that high-value properties are under-taxed, which is welcome. But rather than taxing them only on sale, why does he not have the courage of his conviction? The average person pays 390 times more in annual council tax as a percentage of their property than the billionaire buyer of a &#163;140 million penthouse in Hyde park. Why will the Chancellor not have an annual charge on the highest value properties and use that for a &#163;2.5 billion a year investment in the NHS so that we can have 20,000 nurses and 8,000 GPs every year? Why will he not match that commitment? Our national health service deserves a proper funded long-term plan, not just more short-term sticking plaster.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/12">We then heard the Chancellor&#8217;s diversionary stunt. He had to admit today that he has failed to balance the books in this Parliament. He is now trying to divert attention with a vote on balancing the books in the next Parliament. At the time of the Budget, he talked up a vote on the overall budget surplus, but I understand</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/13">from reports in the</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/14" class="italic">Financial Times</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/15">that he has done a U-turn and retreated to a vote on a current budget surplus in the next Parliament. Will he explain what is going on with that vote and the nature of the problem that he is dealing with? We want to get the current budget back into surplus as soon as possible in the next Parliament, and get the national debt falling, but the lesson of this autumn statement is that a plan to balance the books will work only if it puts good jobs, rising living standards and stronger growth at its heart.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/16">The Chancellor&#8217;s diversionary tactics will not work. Since he sat down, I have received the Office for Budget Responsibility&#8217;s forecasts. Table 1.2 on page 15 sets out in detail how the latest forecast compares with the forecast at the time of the Budget. It gives us the numbers that the Chancellor failed to tell us in his autumn statement. I will give the country and the House those numbers. Compared with his Budget target&#8212;it is here on page 15 in table 1.2&#8212;borrowing this year has not gone down. It has been revised up by &#163;4.9 billion. Next year it is revised up by &#163;7.6 billion. Over two years the Chancellor has revised borrowing up by &#163;12.5 billion.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/17">The answer to my other question, which I did not have when I started, is that those figures mean that in this Parliament the Chancellor will have borrowed &#163;219 billion more than he planned in 2010&#8212;&#163;219 billion. It is all here in black and white&#8212;hard evidence from the Office for Budget Responsibility. The Chancellor&#8217;s borrowing targets are all in tatters. We all know that he has changed the way he styles his hair, but he cannot brush away the facts. People are worse off and he has failed to balance the books in this Parliament. For all his strutting, all his preening and all his claims to have fixed the economy&#8212;he promised to make people better off&#8212;working people are worse off. He promised that we were all in this together, then he cut taxes for millionaires. He promised to balance the books in this Parliament, and that commitment is now in tatters&#8212;every target missed, every test failed, every promise broken.</p>
	<p pid="c.319.1/18">We need a recovery for the many, not just a few. We need to balance the books fairly. We need a long-term plan to save our NHS. That is the autumn statement that we needed. It will take a Labour Government to deliver it.</p>

	<p pid="c.321.0/1">With that performance, we see why the right hon. Gentleman is totally unfit to be put in charge of the nation&#8217;s finances in six months&#8217; time. We have had an object lesson in how not to plan an autumn statement reply before hearing the autumn statement. That was what he expected to hear, as we know because he went round the TV studios over the past few weeks predicting it. He said that the deficit would go up this year. He said it last month, he said it last week, he said it on Sunday. I have his words. He said that the Chancellor is going to have to make an autumn statement where he is</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/2">&#8220;going to have to say that the economy is weakening, the deficit is getting larger&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/3">I have just quoted independent forecasts which show that the economy is stronger, the deficit is falling and the debt is lower in every future year. The shadow Chancellor got it completely wrong.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/4">It is hardly surprising that his party has such low economic credibility when the shadow Chancellor repeatedly makes predictions about the British economy that turn out to be completely wrong. No more boom and bust, he said&#8212;wrong. A double-dip recession, he predicted&#8212;completely wrong. He has spent the past three months betting the entire credibility of the Labour party&#8217;s response to the autumn statement on the prediction of a massive deterioration in the public finances and the deficit going up, and he got that completely wrong. People say there is a split in the leadership of the Labour party. They are right. It is between people who get the deficit figures completely wrong and people who forget about the deficit altogether.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/5">The Opposition have no economic credibility and they have policies that show that they are not up to the job. The shadow Chancellor mentioned his homes tax. We still do not know what the Labour party&#8217;s view is of the stamp duty reforms. I guess we will find out in the next few days. We do not have a clue what its views are on the postgraduate changes or the infrastructure investments that we have announced. The right hon. Gentleman spoke about his homes tax. This is what the Labour party thinks about his homes tax. The Chair of the Public Accounts Committee says:</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/6">&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s most sensible idea.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/7">The former Housing Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase>, says that it hits the &#8220;cash poor&#8221;. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40615" name="David Lammy">The right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy)</phrase> says it is &#8220;a tax on London&#8221;, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40212" name="Tessa Jowell">the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Dame Tessa Jowell)</phrase> says:</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/8">&#8220;Let&#8217;s stop calling it a &#8216;mansion tax&#8217;&#8230;these are family homes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/9">One of Labour&#8217;s council group leaders summed it up best when they said it was &#8220;completely bonkers&#8221;. That is the housing policy&#8212;to put taxes on housing.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/10">The shadow Chancellor asked about our tax cut on apprentices. His jobs tax policy is to increase national insurance. He talks about pensions. His pensions policy is to tax pensions. He asked me a couple of questions about savings in the public finances.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/11">I was hoping that he was going to give me some suggestions for savings that we can make in the public finances. I have had to do a bit of research myself about what his party&#8217;s policy is.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/12">The Opposition have conducted what is called a zero-based review for the past year and identified two surplus assets that the Government should sell. The first is the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre. The shadow Chancellor first proposed selling that in 2001 and seems to have forgotten that it is the only bit of Government that pays us an income. The other thing they found to pay down the national debt&#8212;it is in the Labour party document&#8212;is a restaurant in St James&#8217;s park, estimated to be worth &#163;6.7 million. That is 0.005% of the national debt, so their national economic policy is literally out to lunch.</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/13">That is the problem that we have seen in the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s reply. He has absolutely no answers to the economic challenges that Britain faces. He has no credibility and no workable policies because Labour has no workable plan. We are five months away from a general election in which people will have to choose their Government. The most serious responsibility incumbent on anyone seeking office is to show that they</p>
	<p pid="c.321.0/14">can provide economic stability to the nation and protect the families who live here. The Opposition do not have a clue how to do that. They do not have a plan. Their whole response today shows that they would take Britain back to square one. Britain has pulled itself out of the economic crisis that the shadow Chancellor created, and we are not going to let him take us back there.</p>

	<p pid="c.323.0/2">On a more serious note, my right hon. Friend is proposing to devolve considerable powers, in a very welcome way and to varying degrees, to the different nations and cities of the United Kingdom. Can he reassure us that he will combine that with firm and enforceable commitments to financial responsibility so that he and the UK Treasury can retain overall responsibility for the stability of sterling and our economy, because not every local government Labour leader can be trusted to follow the clear and effective path that he has followed in getting our debt back under control?</p>

	<p pid="c.323.1/1">My right hon. and learned Friend makes a good observation about the shadow Chancellor&#8217;s career. I should pay tribute&#8212;probably for the first time&#8212;to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>, who this week announced his retirement: first, for his commitment to advancing international development and to British aid, which I fully support; and secondly, because when he was shadow Chancellor, as we all remember, he built up a really compelling case for fiscal discipline. That, in part, is why the Labour party won the 1997 general election. That stands in such marked contrast to the shambles we see from the pair sitting opposite me now, who subsequently advised him.</p>
	<p pid="c.323.1/2">On my right hon. and learned Friend the former Chancellor&#8217;s good point about devolution, of course both local government and the different nations of the United Kingdom&#8212;the devolution arrangements apply to both&#8212;will have in place robust arrangements that protect taxpayers across the United Kingdom. That is certainly an important part of the Smith commission report and how we must take it forward. It is also at the heart of the devolution settlements that we have discussed with English local authorities.</p>

Did I hear the Chancellor correctly when he was claiming credit for having halved the deficit over the course of this Parliament, because his view used to be that that would not be a terribly good thing? We are still borrowing &#163;90 billion this year, and the reduced growth forecasts for the next five years, which we see in the OBR report, show that it will slow down, so can he tell us what impact that will have on the likely tax revenues, which of course have a bearing on our ability to pay down the deficit?</p>

	<p pid="c.324.0/1">Let me also pay tribute to the former Chancellor for his work on the Scottish referendum campaign. To be fair to him, what we did not know in the debate before the previous general election, but which has subsequently been revealed in the various memoires that have been written about the Government he was at the heart of, is that he was arguing internally for the Government to set out the spending cuts that they would make. Indeed, he argued that the Labour Government should commit to a VAT increase, which of course the Labour party, somewhat hypocritically, opposed several months later when we had to take that step. What we know about his role in the previous Government does him great credit.</p>

Gentleman&#8217;s point, as I explained in my statement, although borrowing falls in each year, the OBR has revised up the borrowing for the first two years but then revised it down, compared with the Budget, in the years after that. The structural deficit continues to fall at the same pace as in the Budget. This is not the big deterioration in the public finances that everyone has been predicting&#8212;it was on the front pages of many newspapers, and indeed the shadow Chancellor went about repeating it. That has not happened. With regard to lower tax receipts, I gave the tax receipts forecast but pointed out that one of the reasons why there has not been that deterioration in the public finances is the big reduction in debt interest payments.</p>

	<p pid="c.324.1/1">The OBR forecasts that over the course of this Parliament the eurozone will grow at a little over 2% and the UK will grow at nearly 9%, which of course is a tribute to the capacity of UK businesses, particularly small businesses, to adapt to the huge economic shock of the euro crisis. However, just doing a bit better than the eurozone is not enough; our prosperity will depend on whether we can absorb the annual shock of increased global competition. Is not it therefore crucial, as we have seen with the pressure on Northern Ireland&#8217;s corporation tax rate, that we do much more to sustain a globally competitive tax system?</p>

	<p pid="c.324.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is not enough just to do better than our neighbours, because of course they have their own problems and are stagnating. If one looks at all the various indexes of global tax competitiveness and global innovation, one sees that the UK is climbing up the ranks. We in the Treasury certainly seek to mark ourselves against the most competitive economies in the world, not just those on the continent of Europe. The steps I have outlined today, which probably will not make it on to the front pages of the newspapers, such as the increase in the small business research and development tax credit, the large company tax credit and changes to entrepreneurs&#8217; relief and its relationship with the enterprise investment scheme, are all designed to support research and development and entrepreneurial business in this country.</p>

As he will see tomorrow, when his colleague the Chief Secretary to the Treasury sets out in Aberdeen what we are doing, the tax cuts we announced today, which will come into effect in the coming weeks, will have an immediate effect, but we are also going to try to set out a longer road map for the direction we want to head in.

That is why Tom Pursglove, our excellent candidate for Corby, and I launched a joint listening campaign to improve things in east Northamptonshire. Unemployment is now 30% lower, and we now have the Rushden Lakes retail development on line and, thanks to the Chancellor this week, the Chowns Mill and the A45 dualling improvements.

	<p pid="c.330.4/1">As my hon. Friend knows&#8212;this is the problem of previous Governments having handed over various powers and rights of this country to Brussels&#8212;we are constrained by the VAT threshold that we can levy in this country. I think that it is already the highest in Europe, so we are restricted in what we can do. That is why we are seeking to help small businesses in her west country constituency both through the measures on business rates, and through investment in infrastructure, such as the A303, the Dawlish rail line and the Kingskerswell bypass. As I saw a few weeks ago, the bypass is proceeding very well in her constituency.</p>

I say the Conservative club, but it has closed and, ironically enough, is now a food bank. If he came to that food bank, he would learn from those who run it that the vast majority of people that they are helping with 2.5 tonnes of food every year are in work. That is because of the sanctions regime, low hours, zero-hours contracts and, most importantly, the bedroom tax. Why does he not deal with any of those facts?</p>

	<p pid="c.331.0/1">First, what the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question reveals is, of course, that when the Labour party says it is committed to fiscal discipline, it does not mean that at all. It opposes welfare changes that bring the welfare budget down, and it opposes all the difficult decisions required to bring public expenditure under control. Because we are able to take those difficult decisions on day-to-day spending, we are able to make investments in infrastructure that will really help all parts of the United Kingdom. A shining example of that is the electrification of the valley lines, which the Prime Minister went to south Wales to talk about. That never happened in all the years that the hon. Gentleman was a Labour Minister and represented the seat as a Labour MP.</p>

Support for the chemical industry is important. The changes to energy taxation in the Budget will help the chemical industry. There might be an opportunity to look at specific things that we could do to help the chemical industry further, rather than all energy-intensive industries. I am happy to have that discussion with him and other Members who represent constituencies with chemical manufacturers.</p>

If a Government are not prepared to address increases in one benefit with reductions or measures on other benefits, they are required to come before the House and ask for a vote because they have reached the cap.

	<p pid="c.338.1/1">The Chancellor has made a number of statements today on infrastructure, but of course developing our infrastructure requires a thriving UK steel industry and supply chain. Will he explain why he and the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills have chosen not to bring forward the energy-intensive industries compensation package that he announced in the Budget earlier this year? Does he believe that the UK steel industry faces a level playing field, and if not, what is he going to do about it?</p>

	<p pid="c.338.2/1">I have long thought that there is a challenge in ensuring that commitments to reduce carbon are consistent with having a vibrant and successful steel industry and other energy-intensive industries. What we hear when we go to Port Talbot and elsewhere is a real concern that UK energy prices could be higher than they are on the rest of the continent of Europe if we adopt measures such as a decarbonisation target. That is why the Conservative party is not in favour of a decarbonisation target. Unfortunately, the Labour party is in favour of it and the steel industry might be one of the industries that will bear the cost.</p>

I am careful to make sure that I read that report each time it comes in. It is partly because people like him have been raising this issue with us that we have taken the big decision today to abolish the job tax when it comes to employing young apprentices. It is a major step forward in supporting apprentices and I think it will open the path to having 3 million apprentices in the next Parliament.</p>

Secondly, the trans-Pennine link supports journeys from Liverpool all the way over to Leeds and Hull, but we also want investment in the rail services in and around Merseyside. That is why we are electrifying the lines in that part of the north-west and why we are looking for major investment in HS2, so that journeys from Liverpool to Birmingham and London will be much quicker once the train joins the track at Crewe.

	<p pid="c.343.0/1">The Chancellor made just one passing reference to wages in his statement, some 42 minutes in, and small wonder. Will he confirm that the OBR has this afternoon revised down its forecast for income tax and national insurance contribution receipts through to 2018-19 by a further &#163;11.8 billion, with &#163;9 billion of that down to lower-than-forecast growth in wages? How can the worst Chancellor on wages for 140 years ever be the answer to higher living standards in the next Parliament?</p>

	<p pid="c.343.1/1">I actually talked about tax receipts and earnings early on in the statement. I pointed out that although tax receipts were lower, crucially they were offset by lower debt interest payments, which is why we have not seen the big deterioration in the public finances that was forecast. Borrowing was lower towards the end of the period than was forecast at the last Budget; the surplus is higher than predicted; and the structural deficit is on course for the reductions we set out. That is because although tax receipts were lower, debt interest payments were also lower.</p>

Linked to that, I thank the Chancellor for the &#163;30 million previously given to Medway through the growth deal to support the infrastructure.

This is about strengthening the transport links between the shire counties and the cities; it is about making sure that superfast broadband is available in our rural areas; it is about supporting towns and not just cities in the north of England. It is about ensuring that the whole thing is connected up in a way that it has not been before, so that the north of England has the economic clout of a great global city.

Gentleman knows. We are now getting closer to the point where we were through the whole of the first 10 years of the last Labour Government, so we have only gone back to where we were. However, a &#163;6 billion increase on overall housing benefit spending over the course of this Parliament has contributed to the Chancellor&#8217;s failure to meet his deficit reduction targets.

	<p pid="c.344.4/1">First, it is no good saying that the first 10 years of that Labour Government were great and that we should forget about the last three, which brought about the greatest recession since the 1920s. It is a bit like Mrs Lincoln being asked about that play.</p>
	<p pid="c.344.4/2">We have taken a number of steps to try to cap housing benefit, rent increases and the housing benefit associated with them; we have introduced a cap on housing benefit payments. When we came to office, there were examples of some people receiving over &#163;100,000 a year from taxpayers in housing benefit, which is of course totally unacceptable. We have taken those steps, and now we have the welfare cap as well. All I can say is that every time Labour Members stand up, we hear about a proposal to add to the housing welfare benefit bill, and that it would be good to hear some proposals from them to reduce it.</p>

	<p pid="c.345.3/1">As a former universities Minister, I welcome the loan scheme for masters students in the statement. However, could not the Chancellor say more about the structure of the economy? The reason why the tax receipts are so low is partly because Britain has lost 1.2 million jobs in the skilled middle section of the economy&#8212;the plumbers and the mechanics, for example. Many of those jobs have been replaced by customer services, which certainly forms the increase in London. Will the Chancellor say something about how to restructure the economy, as we have heard nothing about that today?</p>

	<p pid="c.345.4/1">I think the right hon. Gentleman is being a little unfair about the autumn statement, but I agree with the challenge he presented to us&#8212;how to improve the productivity of the United Kingdom. The measures we take to support postgraduate loans and to support apprenticeships, alongside the education reforms at primary and secondary level that my right hon. Friends the Education Secretary and her predecessor have implemented, are all designed to try to improve the skills in the country. We are all working together to try to address the productivity challenge that we face. Frankly, we faced it for a long time in the past, as our productivity lagged behind some of our European competitors, let alone that of the rest of the world. We need to do more. That can be achieved in London partly by investments in infrastructure, including those in the Tottenham area.</p>

I was there fairly recently and talked to Lord Haskins, the head of the local enterprise partnership. I go out of my way to say that Hull should be part of the northern powerhouse, and I have talked about the links between Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and Hull across the east-west link of the north of England. I think there are real opportunities, alongside the flood defence programme in the Humber estuary that we have talked about. The investment in the enterprise zones there and the Siemens investment in Humberside are important. There are lots of great things happening in Hull, and the &#8220;Hook up Hull&#8221; campaign is yet another example of a great campaign that we are looking to support.</p>

	<p pid="c.347.4/1">As I said in my statement, we face a major challenge when it comes to increasing our exports. As the Office for Budget Responsibility made clear, it has been a challenge for the British economy for the past 20 years. If anything, however, the decline in our exports has slowed down slightly in recent years, compared to what was happening under the last Government. Today I have committed myself to a &#163;45 million fund, which will be available both to UK Trade &amp; Investment and to the Foreign Office, to increase our trade links with the new emerging economies of the world, and to support first-time exporters in particular. Lord Livingston is doing a great job as Trade Minister, and I want to back him.</p>

	<p pid="c.347.5/1">There is much to welcome in the autumn statement, including investment in the NHS and, in particular, investment in mental health. Strangely, that has not been mentioned in any of the questions so far.</p>
	<p pid="c.347.5/2">I especially welcome the excellent news about the introduction of income-contingent postgraduate loans. I agree with what was said earlier by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40305" name="David Willetts">the right hon. Member for Havant (Mr Willetts)</phrase>. Indeed, when he was a Minister I worked with the National Union of Students and CentreForum to persuade him to do exactly this, so it is great to see it happening. More people from disadvantaged backgrounds obtain undergraduate degrees, but then find that they cannot afford to engage in postgraduate study. This welcome and long-awaited change will lower a barrier to social mobility.</p>

	<p pid="c.347.6/1">I thank my hon. Friend for what he has said. I should have been extremely disappointed if my announcement of a big improvement in our support for postgraduate students had not been welcomed by the Member of Parliament for Cambridge. He is absolutely right: the lack of financial support available to people doing post-grads is indeed a barrier, which falls particularly on those from low-income backgrounds, and which has been identified as a real problem in a number of reports on social mobility. I am glad that we have been able to work together to bring about this change.</p>

	<p pid="c.347.7/1">The OBR&#8217;s analysis clearly states that borrowing over the forecast period will increase above and beyond what was forecast back in March, predominantly as a result of the reduction in tax receipts. Far from rebalancing</p>
	<p pid="c.347.7/2">the economy, and failing to meet his own deficit reduction targets, the Chancellor is presiding over a low-pay, zero-hours-contract economy in which one in five people&#8212;one in three in my constituency&#8212;are paid below the living wage. Is it not an insult to the 3 million people on the lowest incomes, and an insult to the value of British fair play, that the Government will be hammering them yet again with a potential cut in tax credits?</p>

	<p pid="c.348.0/1">Today we have increased the personal allowance, which increases the number of low-paid people taken out of income tax to 3.5 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.348.0/2">It is interesting to look at the caricature of what is happening in this country that Labour Members have tried to present. They said that all the jobs were part-time; it turns out that 85% of them are full-time. They talked about the gender pay gap; of course that remains a challenge, but it is at its lowest level in British history, and has fallen since the period of the last Labour Government. They complained about the abuse of zero-hours contracts; I had to sit there for 13 years listening to Labour Chancellors, and never once did they introduce a reform of zero-hours contracts. That reform is now taking place, and we are ending the abuse that comes with the exclusive contracts.</p>
	<p pid="c.348.0/3">Ultimately, the people who suffer most when the economy fails&#8212;when economic stability is destroyed and unemployment rises&#8212;are the poorest people in the country. That, sadly, was their experience under a Labour Government, but under this Government, employment is growing and economic security is returning.</p>

	<p pid="c.354.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, following the announcement regarding the reform of residential rates of stamp duty land tax, made by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I should like to make a short business statement regarding tomorrow&#8217;s business.</p>
	<p pid="c.354.1/2">The business for tomorrow will now be:</p>
	<p pid="c.354.1/3"><phrase class="date" code="2014-12-04">Thursday 4 December</phrase>&#8212;Motion to approve a financial resolution for the purposes of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968, followed by the business as previously announced: a debate on a motion relating to the Financial Conduct Authority redress scheme, and a general debate on availability and pricing of branded medicines on the NHS. The subjects for both debates were recommended by the Backbench Business Committee.</p>

	<p pid="c.354.2/1">I thank the Leader of the House for finally deigning to inform us about the content of the unidentified Government business, which he was so coy about last Thursday. We have been waiting all week with bated breath, wondering what on earth it might be about. We dreamed that it might be about action to tackle low pay or under-employment, which is now rife in the country, hitting living standards and tax receipts. We thought that he might announce an intention to reverse the millionaires&#8217; tax cut, or promise that the Government will not raise VAT. However, with the sudden legislation on stamp duty, are not the Government trying to hide the fact that the Chancellor&#8217;s promise to eliminate the deficit in five years is running four years late, borrowing is up by &#163;12.5 billion compared with the March Budget, and he has had to borrow &#163;219 billion more than he forecast he would in 2010? Is not he attempting to disguise the fact that the Government&#8217;s incompetence has wasted over &#163;100 billion, which is &#163;4,000 for every taxpayer in the country? The Chancellor may think he has a cunning plan, but every day he is looking less like the Machiavelli he models himself on, and more like Baldrick.</p>

	<p pid="c.354.3/1">I will take that as a welcome for the resolution tomorrow. I think that the hon. Lady made a better presentation of the Labour party&#8217;s case than the shadow Chancellor did a couple of hours ago. We look forward to her elevation to that position. She would be a dramatic improvement on the Opposition Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="c.354.3/2">It is apparent why I was coy about the business last week. It would have caused considerable mayhem had I announced the business for tomorrow last week, both to the Chancellor&#8217;s autumn statement and to the housing market. Therefore, I am sure that the House understands the reason why that business has been nominated today, just as I hope that it will understand the tremendous progress announced by the Chancellor in bringing down unemployment and addressing all the other issues that she mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="c.355.2/1">It is certainly possible for the House to divide on such a measure. Hon. Members will have to decide where they stand on it, although the provisional resolution was approved by the House a few minutes ago. There is no time limit on the debate. It is not limited in any way. Indeed it is exempt even from the moment of interruption, but I hope that it will be possible to have the debate on the resolution and maintain a good length of debate for the Backbench Business Committee business, too.</p>

	<p pid="c.355.3/1">I welcome the move that my right hon. Friend has made to table the business so quickly. In 2009, when the Labour party was in government, it brought in a stamp duty holiday but it took the party six or seven weeks to bring that in, which depressed the property market even further. Therefore, I am grateful to my right hon. Friend. Can he say when the measure will be enacted?</p>

	<p pid="c.355.4/1">As the Chancellor announced in his statement, the measure takes effect from midnight tonight &#8212;provided that the resolution was passed, which it was a few minutes ago. A second debate is necessary, as is customary, for the House to be able to look at the provisions in more detail and to debate them, since it has not yet had the opportunity to do so. However, the Chancellor is extremely mindful of any effect on the housing market or forestalling. That is why the measure takes effect at midnight and why we move on speedily to debate it tomorrow.</p>

	<p pid="c.356.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require the provision of audio announcements on public buses; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/3">I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this issue on behalf of Guide Dogs, which is vitally important to each of us in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I hope that it will at least help to raise awareness of the issue and the need for &#8220;talking buses&#8221;. I also hope that this is something that we can start at Westminster today and follow through in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The evidence from across the United Kingdom is overwhelming in support of introducing audio announcements on all UK buses, rather than just those in London. That is why I wanted to raise the issue, which affects all of us. I hope to see this brought in to every part of the United Kingdom in the coming months and years.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/4">The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 and the related Northern Ireland regulations stated that new buses had to include certain features to make them accessible to people in wheelchairs, such as low floors and ramps. We want the same legislation for all the UK, starting in England, and going to Scotland, Wales and elsewhere. Unfortunately, that legislation did not go far enough. It did not include requirements to make buses accessible to people with sight loss. That is what this motion is about.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/5">Unlike rail, where audio-visual announcements are required on all new trains, only 19% of buses&#8212;the vast majority of them in London&#8212;provide next stop information for passengers. The Department for Transport reported that 97% of buses with audio announcements were in the capital, which leaves only 3% across the rest of the UK. That imbalance has to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/6">That means that the majority of blind passengers outside London have to rely on bus drivers to tell them when to get off. A visually impaired passenger in Glasgow claimed that the</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/7">&#8220;common response to the request to let me off at a particular stop is &#8216;if I remember&#8217; and a common outcome is that they do forget&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/8">Of course we cannot blame the bus drivers or hold them to account because it is not really their job to do that and, like all of us, they do sometimes forget. Guide Dogs&#8217; 2014 &#8220;Destination Unknown&#8221; report shows that, without audio announcements, seven in 10 blind and partially sighted passengers have been forgotten on the bus. For a sighted person, missing a bus stop can be an annoyance and an inconvenience, but for a person with sight loss, that can be extremely distressing and even dangerous. The experience can put people off using buses as a form of public transport; in fact 63% of blind and partially sighted people stay at home at least twice a month instead of relying on the bus. That has to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/9">There are 360,000 people registered as blind or partially sighted in the UK, and there are over 2 million people living with sight loss. That is roughly one in 30 people</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/10">we meet. With an ageing population and the increasing incidence of diabetes&#8212;something which, as a sufferer of type 2 diabetes, I can understand&#8212;it is predicted that the blind or partially sighted population will reach 4 million by 2050. That is a vast number of people and we need to address those issues today.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/11">Audio announcements are not just supported by those who are blind or visually impaired. For example, Paula, a bus passenger in my own constituency of Strangford noted:</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/12">&#8220;as a nurse working a long stint of night duty, I asked the bus driver to give me a shout when it was my stop. I fell asleep, he forgot and I had a huge hike home in horrible weather.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/13">She is not visually impaired but she believes, as many others do, that talking buses are a no-brainer for everyone. A simple easy technique, it is on trains, so why not buses?</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/14">According to the Chair of the Select Committee on Transport:</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/15">&#8220;there are 11.5 million disabled people in the UK, one fifth of whom report difficulty with transport.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/16">A Government survey showed that 37% of disabled respondents found transport accessibility a significant barrier to work. Guide Dogs&#8217; data reinforce those findings, which show that the lack of audio announcements led to people with sight loss missing job interviews, turning down jobs, being late for work or even losing a job. Given the current economic climate, no one can afford to lose their job, or miss out on securing a job because of their difficulties with public transport.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/17">The benefits of talking buses are not just confined to the blind or visually impaired. They can help to support older people, they can reinvigorate the bus industry by increasing the numbers of passengers, and they can bring environmental benefits with more people swapping the car for the bus. They can also attract tourists from both inside and outside the UK to use the buses. We cannot deny that audio announcements will help the tourist industry. There is a spin-off in that regard: many tourists use the metro buses in our capital, and when stops are announced, that helps them. The metro services which serve the cities are great, but I believe we must aim to get talking buses on to every route, rather than just metro lines. Of course this varies all over the United Kingdom, but Northern Ireland is a particularly rural community, as are some of the areas represented by the supporters of this Bill. People are extremely reliant on both rural and urban buses, but unfortunately at present the new talking buses on the metro lines will only serve those living in the urban centres, and relatively few of those outside it.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/18">A YouGov survey showed that 85% of UK adults who already use buses fitted with audio announcements find them useful. Another finding from the survey was that 19% of 25 to 34-year-old motorists said they would be more likely to use the bus if it had an audio system installed. A 19% reduction in cars would see congestion levels well reduced and of course this would be a more environmentally friendly approach. That proves that the installation of an audio system would benefit all travellers, rather than just one specific group.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/19">Last September, the Select Committee on Transport gave its support to talking buses. However, the Government&#8217;s response to its report was not quite so positive. They claimed there were three reasons why they could not make audio announcements mandatory; first, that they planned to increase voluntary uptake of these systems among bus operators; secondly, and perhaps unsurprisingly, that there was a fear of a financial burden on the industry; and, finally, that there was the possibility that smartphones might be an alternative.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/20">In terms of voluntary uptake, a previous Transport Minister wrote to bus operators encouraging them to take up audio-visual, or AV, up on a voluntary basis. Despite some good examples, the uptake was very limited, as the earlier figure of 19% would suggest. This might have been a good idea, but unfortunately the reality is that bus operators are not rolling out these AV systems, and some bus drivers are not assisting their visually impaired passengers. In fact, 54% of blind and partially sighted people have missed their bus stop because drivers did not inform them when they had reached it.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/21">In terms of costs, leading passenger transport specialists the TAS Partnership found that it costs just &#163;2,100 to install AV on a single-decker bus or &#163;2,550 on a double-decker bus. To put that into perspective, a new double-decker bus costs around &#163;190,000, so to fit all new buses in the UK with AV would cost very little in each year, and the ongoing costs are fairly minimal so there is no ongoing charge after the initial hardware has been purchased.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/22">We are all aware of the financial constraints Governments are facing now, but any economic costs are repaid by the benefits that audio announcements would bring. It has been revealed that for every &#163;1 of public money spent on transport, there are &#163;3 of benefits. This means that the installation of AV would actually return over &#163;15 million each year extra, so this appears to be a financial solution with short-term costs bringing about long-term gains.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/23">I have some issues with smartphones, which have been suggested as an alternative to AV, with &#8220;apps&#8221; that can be downloaded and used. There are clear limitations with these. First, not only the apps, but the phones themselves, can be extremely expensive and so are not always practical, and they are not particularly reliable due to varied network coverage and battery life issues. It has been noted:</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/24">&#8220;19% of families with at least one disabled member live in relative income poverty. For them, smartphones may be too expensive or difficult to use.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/25">In conclusion, I am pleased to see some progress being made at home in Northern Ireland and here on the mainland, but we must do more. Every single person should have the freedom and ability to move unaided throughout this great nation, and this is one way of ensuring that that happens.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/26">It has been a privilege to be able to speak on such an important subject, and I must thank Guide Dogs for their help in providing useful information and statistics for me. This is something which really is of the utmost importance, not just for the blind and partially sighted, as I have mentioned, but for all of us throughout all of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="c.356.2/27">This Bill would benefit every single bus passenger in the UK and would ensure that the public service vehicles accessibility regulations are up to date, and include all those with disabilities, rather than just wheelchair-users, as at present. I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.361.6/1">It is a pleasure to be here this afternoon for Report stage and Third Reading, and I do not think I can quite do justice to the excitement and delight that I felt when I saw that the final stages were indeed to be taken straight after the autumn statement. I am sure that is a view shared by the Minister, who will also be grateful for this miraculous feat of scheduling. Given the vast numbers who have turned out to hear us this afternoon, the excitement is obviously broadly shared across the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.361.6/2">This is a serious Bill, however, and we have serious matters to discuss this afternoon, so I will now turn to the content of new clauses 1 and 2. There is a certain symmetry to the scheduling of today&#8217;s proceedings, because the reforms in the Bill were first announced in the Budget statement and we are now discussing the Bill&#8217;s final stages alongside the autumn statement. We should be impressed&#8212;if that is the right word&#8212;by the speed with which the Government have rushed through these very significant pension reforms, although, given that we will now rush through something else even more quickly as a result of the autumn statement, perhaps I should have waited to hear that statement before writing that line in my script for this debate.</p>

	<p pid="c.362.0/1">My hon. Friend has congratulated the Government on the speed with which they have brought in these measures. She will be aware that I have secured an Adjournment debate later today on the unintended consequences that have been visited on some of my constituents as a result of previous hastily introduced pension legislation. The Government have attempted to undo that legislation but, unfortunately, without any great success. Will my hon. Friend therefore temper her praise and reflect on the fact that hastily introduced pension legislation can often have unintended consequences?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-12-03c.362.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" colnum="362"  time="015:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141203/debtext/141203-0002.htm#141203-0002.htm_spnew166">
	<p pid="c.362.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. If I had continued my speech for another couple of lines, he would have understood that my praise was somewhat tongue in cheek, given what I am about to say about the haste with which the measures have been introduced, about the impact that that has had, and about the concerns expressed by the industry. I know that my hon. Friend is taking up these issues on behalf of his constituents and putting them forward very seriously. We still do not know all the unintended consequences that will result from this Bill and the Pension Schemes Bill, which has now gone through the House, and that is one reason why I want to speak to the new clauses today.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/2">At least one of the new clauses will seem familiar to those who had the pleasure, as I did, of serving on the Bill Committee. We have been consistent in our approach to the reforms. We have always said that we supported the principles of greater freedom and choice, but only when that leads to better outcomes for consumers. That is why we have consistently called on the Government to give us evidence that they have undertaken the appropriate assessment and analysis of the impact and potential consequences of the reforms. This also relates to what my hon. Friend has just said. For as long as we have pressed the Financial Secretary to the Treasury to provide that information, he has politely but firmly refused to do so. We on this side of the House are nothing if not persistent, however, and it would be remiss of us not to make one final attempt to bring the Government round to our way of thinking and to persuade them to accept our new clauses.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/3">In a moment, I shall ask the Minister some questions on the figures that have been published today, but first I want to refer to some of the points that have been made about the speed with which the Bill has been taken through Parliament. Comments have been made in</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/4">briefings and submitted in evidence as we have approached Third Reading. For example, the Association of British Insurers has stated that</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/5">&#8220;it is becoming increasingly clear that the first phase of the introduction of these reforms will be delivered in a period of regulatory uncertainty.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/6">The impact of that will be felt by the constituents of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40165" name="Toby Perkins">the Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins)</phrase>. The ABI goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/7">&#8220;There is still a lack of clarity about what is expected of anyone offering retirement products from next April.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/8">I will come back to those points in a moment. The Bill has had thorough scrutiny, but a number of issues remain that we wish to pursue.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/9">New clause 1 calls for a Treasury review within two years of the reforms coming into force on <phrase class="date" code="2015-04-06">6 April 2015</phrase>, detailing the impact of the Bill on Government revenues, with particular reference to opportunities for tax avoidance and national insurance contributions avoidance. In Committee, we tried to get more details and figures, and the comments of John Greenwood and others were often quoted, particularly those relating to concerns that the Bill could allow individuals to divert large sums into their pensions through salary sacrifice. Those individuals would then be able to take as much as they wished from that pension in the following year, as 25% would be tax free and the rest would be charged at their marginal rate, with no money deducted through national insurance contributions. Although the introduction of the money purchase annual allowance rules is supposed to prevent that, the reduced &#163;10,000 limit is activated only after the pension has been flexibly accessed for the first time.</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/10">The Association of Accounting Technicians has raised concerns about this, saying:</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/11">&#8220;In the first year, before the &#163;40,000 allowance is lost, individuals over the age of 55 will still have the scope to save tax and NI on the full &#163;40,000, provided they have the necessary earnings, less their existing pension contributions. Where an individual flushes (passes) an extra &#163;30,000 through pension rather than drawing salary they will achieve a saving of &#163;3,600 in employee NI, more than &#163;1,500 in income tax and, also, &#163;4,140 in employer NI (13.8%) in the first year. A total loss to the public purse of &#163;9,240. The &#8220;Freedom and choice in pensions&#8221; rules mean this money can be withdrawn immediately if an individual is over 55. This fact means that there will not be clear distinction between salary and pension for this age group.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.362.1/12">I have some questions for the Minister about that. Does he agree that the Bill, as it stands, would afford additional scope for tax avoidance of the type outlined? I know we have discussed this matter in Committee, but it is important to probe it until the last possible moment.</p>

	<p pid="c.363.0/1">The hon. Lady has obviously done a lot of research on this. As I understand it, once a flexible draw-down is started, the tax relief is then limited beyond that, so cascading &#163;40,000 of tax relief year after year is not possible. That is my reading of the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-12-03c.363.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" colnum="363"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141203/debtext/141203-0003.htm#141203-0003.htm_spnew1">
	<p pid="c.363.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, as those are exactly the kind of detailed points that I hope the Minister will respond to when he gives his views on the provisions. These are exactly the sort of questions to ask: is that the type of tax avoidance that we have described and the AAT has suggested would</p>
	<p pid="c.363.1/2">be an issue? Is it possible? Is it an intended consequence of the Bill? During the Public Bill Committee he explicitly told us that allowing individuals to avoid income tax and national insurance contributions is &#8220;not the intention&#8221; of the reforms, and I had no doubt that he was genuine on that. However, people are still coming to us and repeatedly outlining concerns about the scale of tax avoidance that could be facilitated by the Bill. Therefore, it is important that we continue to pursue the matter, even at this late stage, and be given assurances on it.</p>
	<p pid="c.363.1/3">Towers Watson has said that Ministers seem &#8220;sanguine&#8221; on this matter. I am sure that the Minister is not sanguine in any shape or form about the potential for tax avoidance, that he would want to close any loopholes and that he would want to send a clear message that it was not his intention that the Bill be used for any attempt at tax avoidance. That is particularly the case because, as has been repeated again today, tax revenues and the take into the Exchequer are falling, because of some of the Government&#8217;s other economic policies, particularly on wages and the impact on income tax and national insurance. It is not as though the Exchequer is going to be able to afford to lose hundreds of millions of pounds of tax income.</p>
	<p pid="c.363.1/4">Interestingly, the written evidence from Towers Watson cited the Minister&#8217;s assurance that</p>
	<p pid="c.363.1/5">&#8220;the government will be closely monitoring behaviour under the new system&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.363.1/6">and will take action &#8220;if loss accelerates&#8221; Towers Watson&#8217;s evidence suggests that it is very likely that action will be required. Complementing the AAT estimates of how much tax could be lost if individuals use salary sacrifice before they have accessed their pensions flexibly, Towers Watson provides an estimate of how much tax could be lost after a pension has been accessed flexibly and the money purchase annual allowance imposed. Towers Watson&#8217;s projection returns us to the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40494" name="Ian Swales">the hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales)</phrase> and shows why we have pursued this matter vigorously. Towers Watson states that</p>
	<p pid="c.363.1/7">&#8220;if &#163;10,000 of salary is given up in exchange for an employer pension contribution, the employer could pay &#163;1,380 less National Insurance while the employee would pay between &#163;200 and &#163;1,200 less&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.363.1/8">Although the annual allowance does not altogether remove the scope for tax avoidance, it does have a limiting effect, which of course we welcome. The crucial point made by Towers Watson, however, is that this is not a potential tax avoidance opportunity that has been &#8220;dreamt up by accountants&#8221;, but one that could be &#8220;created by legislation&#8221; before us today.</p>
	<p pid="c.363.1/9">Taxpayers and employers need to know whether the Government will regard the diversion of salary through pensions as legitimate. Some people have suggested that the Government drafted the legislation oblivious to the loophole they were creating and that when they realised the consequences, they came up with the money purchase annual allowance rules as a partial stop-gap. I am inclined to be slightly more generous, because I am sure that the Government were very conscientious in drafting the Bill and gave consideration to all its component parts. I am sure that the Minister will reassure us on that point in his response. I know that he is concerned about the potential for tax avoidance, because he has repeatedly told us that he will &#8220;closely monitor behaviour&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.363.1/10">under the new system and that he will work with the industry to ensure that the system remains &#8220;fair and proportionate&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="c.365.0/1">I am following the hon. Lady&#8217;s argument closely. Is she suggesting that this Bill creates new avenues for employer contributions to pension schemes? As I understand it, what she describes is available in the current system.</p>

	<p pid="c.365.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I hope the Minister will provide a clear steer to people about what would be acceptable both to employers and employees. I would also be interested to learn what he plans to do if the system turns out not to be fair and proportionate, and what form the monitoring will take. That is why we have proposed new clause 1. We did debate the matter in Committee, but we are still concerned that we have not heard exactly how the monitoring will take place and what the Minister intends to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.1/2">Essentially, new clause 1 asks the Government to commit to doing something that the Minister has already said that they would do&#8212;to monitor and review the reforms to ensure that they are not used for the purpose of tax avoidance. We simply want that commitment in the Bill, to ensure that there are reports back to the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.1/3">When we first debated the issue, concerns were raised about the time scale in which we were asking for the review. We had not, at that stage, fully anticipated how long it would be before patterns were established and problems had manifested themselves, which is why the new clause includes a two-year-time frame.</p>

	<p pid="c.365.2/1">Did I hear my hon. Friend correctly when she said that the Minister was minded to carry out a review of precisely the areas that we have suggested in new clauses 1 and 2?

	<p pid="c.365.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. As I have said, we did have some of this debate in Committee. I know that the Minister, at various stages, has said that everything is under review and that all things are reviewed. What we seek to do is to put some structure around that so that all reports are brought back before the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.3/2">I think I have made my point in previous Bill Committees and probably at the Dispatch Box as well. Even in my relatively short time in this place and on the Front Bench, I have seen Ministers come and go before my very eyes. I have no doubt that the Minister is concerned to ensure that he does the right thing and monitors what is happening, but it is important to have that commitment on behalf of the Government, which is why I have tabled the new clause.</p>
	<p pid="c.365.3/3">New clause 2 would provide for a Treasury review of the Bill&#8217;s operation within 18 months of <phrase class="date" code="2015-04-06">6 April 2015</phrase>. Such a review would include an analysis of its distributional impact by income decile, an analysis of the impact on Government revenues of changes to the taxation of</p>
	<p pid="c.365.3/4">pensions on death, a behavioural analysis and an analysis of the impact on the purchase of annuities. Any Bill that will have a significant impact on not only people&#8217;s lives, but the broader industry and the economy, must be based on evidence, engagement and analysis. We know from our probing in Committee why the Government announced the reforms without consultation, and the Minister explained his position on concerns about the impact on the market. However, it would be helpful to have some idea of whether the Government had carried out the behavioural analysis and impact assessment that we are requesting, and indeed of not only the extent to which that had been done, but what information they could set out. Those points have also been pursued by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40193" name="Gregg McClymont">the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East (Gregg McClymont)</phrase>, who worked tirelessly on the Pension Schemes Bill.

	<p pid="c.366.0/1">Surely the purpose of such a review would be to drive action. We have an expectation of the Bill&#8217;s effect on the annuities market, so will the hon. Lady tell us how the results of the annuities aspect of her proposed review would affect a future Government&#8217;s actions? Does she think that it would make any difference to Government policy if there was a 10% or a 90% change in the purchase of annuities, because it seems to me that it would not?</p>

	<p pid="c.366.1/1">The purpose of the monitoring is to determine whether the Bill has unintended consequences. We would want the process to deal with our concerns of whether the market responds to the changes and if the products that people have envisaged will be available. There is the oft-quoted example of what happened in Australia: people drew down money, but many found that they had not properly planned for the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.366.1/2">The hon. Gentleman asks what the Government would do, but I think that the Government have a responsibility to keep all legislation under review by looking at its effects and examining whether measures are fit for purpose and if they do what they say on the tin. If changes need to be made, the Government of the day will bring forward appropriate provisions. They have a responsibility to makethemselves aware of any unintended consequences that might arise from the Bill and they should tell us how they will close any loopholes.</p>

	<p pid="c.366.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valuable point. The Public Bill Committee examined what options will be available to people and how we can ensure that the balance is right so that they are encouraged not only to take up pensions at the earliest possible stage, such as through auto-enrolment, but to think about planning for their long-term future. The aim was to ensure that people would not think that there was a windfall at age 55, perhaps make wrong decisions about it, and find by their 75th birthday that they had not done the correct planning. The new clause is very much about trying to</p>
	<p pid="c.366.3/2">see how the provisions will impact on real people when the time comes for them to make these decisions. That is why we were talking about behavioural analysis; we want to ensure that lessons are learned from it.</p>

	<p pid="c.367.0/1">Surely we know the answer to the question prompted by new clause 2(2)(e), more or less; it is that dramatically fewer annuities will be purchased. Okay, a review might show that the figure is 12% as opposed to 90%, but what action would be taken pursuant to that answer?</p>

	<p pid="c.367.1/1">It is a bit chicken-and-egg: until we do the analysis, we do not really know the extent of the problem. The solution would come once the problems were identified. The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about annuities; that takes me back to the issue that I raised about the opportunity for new products. There is a relatively short period of time in which to develop them. The industry, of course, says that it will try to meet the &#8220;challenges&#8221;&#8212;it consistently uses that word&#8212;and ensure that there are options and products. None the less, I find it difficult to understand why the Government seem resistant to the new clauses.</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/2">I think it was Ernest Hemingway who said that his novels were like icebergs:</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/3">&#8220;There is seven-eighths of it under water for every part that shows.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/4">Sometimes the same can be said of legislation, because the devil is in the detail. One has to see the detail, and be on top of it over a period, to find out what the ongoing impact is. That is why, throughout the passage of the Bill, we have tried to identify and probe any fault-lines on the surface of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/5">The guidance guarantee has been the subject of considerable debate, although it essentially formed part of the Pension Schemes Bill. Although we have now seen information on the overarching standards and the apportioning of the levy, published on Friday by the Financial Conduct Authority, we have yet to see all the content of that guarantee. Of course, that is the responsibility of the Government, in tandem with delivery partners. It is vital that the guidance is up and running, and is equal to consumer needs, come April next year. The FCA policy statement published on Friday confirmed that, at least initially, there will be no &#8220;second line of defence&#8221;, as it was described, which makes it even more important that the guidance is fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/6">In the Public Bill Committee, I talked about the potential impact of the reforms on eligibility for social care. We identified two separate but related points on social care that we believe the Government have not yet adequately addressed. The first is the impact that drawing down money under flexi-access may have on an individual&#8217;s entitlement to means-tested benefits and eligibility for social care. The second is a point that I raised earlier: the danger that too much emphasis has been placed on early access to funds. That may result in people taking too much, too quickly, and being left with insufficient funds to cover the cost of care later in life. That is why our review calls for a distributional impact of the reforms by income decile. That is also why we need behavioural analysis. Signs may emerge that consumers are accessing their pensions earlier, which increases the chance that they may be left short of money in later life.</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/7">As we heard in Committee, many individuals who access their pension flexibly risk being hit with an unexpected tax bill&#8212;a point that the Association of British Insurers highlighted:</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/8">&#8220;Many people will struggle to understand the tax consequences of these reforms. Apart from tax free lump sums, withdrawals from pension pots are taxable pension income&#8230;Not only may people find themselves unexpectedly paying higher rate tax, it is possible that some will be unaware that their tax may not be settled for a year after they have accessed their funds through a self-assessment process that they may be unfamiliar with.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/9">These risks have to be monitored and reviewed, so that any unintended consequences can be picked up and dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/10">We also need to see&#8212;this comes back to the point raised earlier&#8212;whether the Bill results in a proliferation of new products. The impact of such products on consumer behaviour should be monitored. In its 2014 risk outlook the Financial Conduct Authority expressed concern that</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/11">&#8220;retirement income products and distribution may deliver poor customer outcomes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/12">It said:</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/13">&#8220;While recent proposals for pension reform plan to allow consumers to access any amount of their pension pot at age 55, the need for consumers to understand the options available to them at retirement is still paramount. Any future innovation in decumulation products will compound these risks.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/14">The FCA was, again, trying to look to the future. We share those concerns. We do not want poor outcomes for consumers, and I am sure the Minister does not want that either.</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/15">A further issue is that new products may carry additional charges that eat away at an individual&#8217;s pension. Research from the House of Commons Library found that current income drawdown products could see 27% of an average pension pot of &#163;30,000 eaten up in fees and charges. If the reforms lead to continued abuse of charges, the Government may have to consider the introduction of a charge cap.</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/16">The changes made in schedule 2 abolish the 55% tax on pension funds on the death of the member. We can see the Government&#8217;s reasons for doing this, but it would be worth monitoring the impact on consumer behaviour and Government revenue.</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/17">I said that I wanted to ask the Minister some particular questions in relation to the autumn statement and the figures that had been published. Throughout the Committee stage, when we were pressing for information and numbers, the Minister said that those would be published in due course. True to his word, that information is now available to us. What effect will the revisions have on the initial costings of the impact of these reforms? Has he had cause to reconsider the impact of the reforms? Can he explain why the tax take increases because of the annual allowance in 2015-16, but falls in subsequent years? What is the basis for those figures?</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/18">Can the Minister give us any more detail about the costing of the salary sacrifice and welfare forecast provisions? The numbers are there, but we do not have further information in the autumn statement policy costing document. In comparison to some of the figures provided in Committee, the estimates still seem low. Given that the Minister has revised his forecast to take into account salary sacrifice and welfare at such short notice that it is not included in the autumn statement</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/19">documents, had the Government fully considered those factors when they initially drew up these reforms, or did they only later recognise the significance of those factors?</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/20">We have asked for a review, as set out in new clause 1, to show whether the Bill increases the scope for tax avoidance and the avoidance of national insurance contributions. In the light of the figures that have been published, is the Minister confident that all his projections will prove to be accurate?</p>
	<p pid="c.367.1/21">I have had a fair opportunity to set out the case for new clauses 1 and 2, which will allow the Minister to keep his word and monitor, review and report information as appropriate. It is important that the clauses are added to the Bill to ensure that that happens. We need to keep a close watch on the progress of the reforms to make sure that they do not lead to adverse outcomes for consumers or place increased costs on the state. The Government have consistently assured us that they will closely monitor the impact of the Bill, so we see no reason why, even at this late stage, they cannot commit to make good on that assurance and accept the new clauses.</p>

	<p pid="c.369.0/1">I rise to speak on behalf of Plaid Cymru and in support of amendment (a), which stands in my name, to Labour&#8217;s new clause 2. I agree with much of that new clause, but I wish to add that the Government should bring forward a report on the impact of the changes introduced by the Bill specifically on the housing market and introduce measures to rectify any problems, should it become apparent that there are negative consequences. I sincerely hope that my concerns are entirely unfounded.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/2">Although we welcome the Government&#8217;s desire to reform the private pensions system, we in Plaid Cymru have concerns about the consequences of behavioural changes in the pensions industry, particularly in relation to individual pensioners taking large draw-downs of money. We are not against pension savers being able to access their pension pots as a lump sum. If that is how people wish to access their money, it is up to them to do as they see fit. Given the rates of return achieved these days, it is not surprising that many people will wish to take that route.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/3">Our concern is that the effect might not be quite what the Government intend. Aside from consumer protection issues and stopping people being targeted by sharks and cowboys seeking to exploit those who are newly able to access comparatively large amounts of money, attention needs to be given to the longer-term possibility that those who draw down large amounts and whose subsequent investments fail, for whatever reason, will be left with little or no money on which to see out their final years, despite having contributed to a pension scheme for most of their lives, and that they will then become a burden on the public purse. It is fair enough to say that the buyer should beware, but we are not talking about purchasing a new television; a wrong decision in this case might have grave, long-term effects on people&#8217;s basic incomes.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/4">As has already been mentioned, in Australia, where the Government have introduced changes similar to those intended here, many people took large draw-downs and invested the money in buy-to-let properties. As the</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/5">TUC has noted, much evidence indicates that the same will happen here, despite Ministers&#8217; talk of people making home improvements, buying new kitchens or going out and buying cars and other consumer goods that will boost the productive economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/6">Research by the Australian investment management firm Challenger has found that one third of savers used their pension cash to buy a home, pay off an outstanding mortgage or make home improvements; one in five splashed out on a new car; and one in seven spent at least some of their pension on a holiday. The evidence from Australia is that, when given the choice, only one in 25 Australians now buy an annuity. In the US, another country where annuities are not mandatory, most people take their pension money as cash, rather than buying an annuity. Indeed, a buy-to-let property might appear to be one of the better options for many people, rather than keeping their money in their pension scheme or making other, more conservative investments.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/7">Some large accountancy firms, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers, have said that the changes to the annuities system will be a net positive for the Treasury. They perhaps foresee the revenue raised through stamp duty and other associated taxes. But it is not the Treasury&#8217;s coffers that will suffer, at least not in the short term. It is the potential bubble in house prices that concerns me, particularly at a local level, and the potentially growing number of people who would then be unable to buy their own home, the strengthening of the historical over-reliance of the British economy on a buoyant housing market, and the potential effects on investors&#8217; incomes should, or rather when, the bubble bursts.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/8">I need hardly remind the House of the dangers of an over-inflated property market, of which buy-to-let is a significant factor, and indeed one of the significant causes of the financial crash in 2008. Even prior to the crash, in August 2007, Oxford Economics noted that buy to let</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/9">&#8220;is undoubtedly contributing to the overvaluation of housing.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/10">Were I cynical, I might even characterise inflation of the housing market as some sort of giant Ponzi scheme, helping to keep the economy afloat while doing little to contribute to productive capital, the epitome of the rentier society&#8212;if I was cynical.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/11">Of more significance to my constituents, and to people throughout Wales and the more picturesque areas of the UK, is the potential that those taking large draw-downs would decide to buy holiday homes. I need not rehearse in any detail the arguments about the problems associated with an over-preponderance of holiday homes. Hon. Members who represent constituencies where that is a problem will be only too aware of the negative effects. Anyone who really wants to know about it might read my maiden speech from 2001, which addressed housing matters and this problem, in particular. To put it briefly, having too many holiday homes in an area has a negative, deadweight effect on the local economy. Local people, especially young people, are unable to afford homes because of price inflation and are forced to leave. In my constituency, and in much of rural Wales, there is the added dimension of the damaging effect that has on the Welsh language. We have been largely spared some of those effects over the years of economic difficulty, but now, if the Chancellor is to be believed, we are moving towards a new golden age of plenty, possibly financed in part by pension lump sums, with a consequent revival of these risks.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/12">I do not wish to over-egg the pudding, but I draw the Minister&#8217;s attention to the previous Labour Government&#8217;s proposal to allow tax relief on self-invested pension plans for any investment, including old master paintings, fine wines, and, indeed, holiday homes. I argued at the time that this might allow potential holiday home investors to benefit from up to 40% tax relief on such an investment, and price local people out of the market. I well remember two initially slightly frosty, and then rather stormy, meetings with the then Treasury Minister, Ruth Kelly. I was aided in the first by Simon Thomas, the then MP for Ceredigion, and joined in the second by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>. Ruth Kelly assured us that we need not bother our heads with such concerns because any tax advantage would be mopped up by other means. A few short weeks before the provision was to be brought in, it was withdrawn.</p>
	<p pid="c.369.0/13">I make no claims about that, but I would not wish the current Minister to suffer such a post-legislative fate this time. That is the reason for this probing amendment calling for an analysis of the effects on the housing market. I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response.</p>

	<p pid="c.371.0/1">I am pleased to take part in the Report stage of a Bill that we discussed at some length in Committee, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> will know. She has led for us throughout with such conscientiousness and command of detail that we probably do not need to labour further the points that we have pressed on the Minister. I am pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40045" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase> has added to our thinking on new clause 2 by suggesting that the effect on the housing market, in particular, should be kept under strict review.</p>
	<p pid="c.371.0/2">I fear that the Minister is not going to accept either new clause, so I ask him to make a clear statement on the areas where the Bill is likely to have an impact, with potentially severe economic consequences. In the light of the Chancellor&#8217;s autumn statement earlier today, we see just how severe the problems on the deficit and Government borrowing are. If the Bill is going to have a further major impact in terms of tax receipts&#8212;which are already disappointingly low, as the Minister himself must recognise, being very well acquainted with that area of the Treasury&#8217;s affairs&#8212;it needs to be regularly reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="c.371.0/3">In pushing for the changes we propose, we are merely doing what any responsible Opposition may do. I am surprised that the Minister is so reticent about sharing these important matters with the House. As the hon. Member for Arfon said, the consequences in the housing market could be quite severe, particularly in the buy-to-rent sector. In Committee, I mentioned to him anecdotal information that I had received from the housing market in strongly Conservative areas such as Buckinghamshire. House prices are already rising, and this aspect needs to be reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="c.371.0/4">The point that we made very strongly throughout the Committee stage is that this is an unknown area where there is a fear of scams and abuses emerging&#8212;mis-selling and such things that have characterised so much of the industry in the past. Even now, we are still clearing up some of the mess from those previous schemes that went so horribly wrong. Not only that, but looking at this from the point of view of economic management,</p>
	<p pid="c.371.0/5">big sums are involved. I have talked to pension fund and investment fund managers, and they are looking forward to it.</p>
	<p pid="c.371.0/6">As my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun has made clear, we welcome the Bill. We are not opposed to it in principle, but we want to make sure that it has the effects that are foreseen as regards flexibility and making greater independence available to very many people throughout the country. It is in the spirit of not just avoiding abuses, but ensuring that the Bill does not become counter-productive or have exactly the detrimental consequences that other Bills of this kind have had that we urge the Minister to accept, even at this late stage, both new clause 1 and new clause 2. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to repeat that point on Report.</p>

	<p pid="c.372.0/1">I do not intend to detain the House unduly, but I want to speak briefly in support of new clause 1, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase>. I also do not intend to give too much advance notice of my Adjournment debate, which I will have the pleasure of holding later and to which I know that the House is looking forward with considerable interest.</p>
	<p pid="c.372.0/2">My hon. Friend made an important point about the haste with which some of the changes have been introduced and the impact that that can have. The Government may be entirely well meaning, but such changes can have unintended consequences, and I shall refer to some of them in more detail later.</p>
	<p pid="c.372.0/3">If I had been contacted by my constituents and had a response from the Minister a few weeks or months earlier, there might have been an appropriate opportunity to propose that the issue was looked into in relation to the Bill, but perhaps there will be an opportunity to consider such issues in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="c.372.0/4">It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40186" name="Geoffrey Robinson">the Member for Coventry North West (Mr Robinson)</phrase>, who speaks with tremendous knowledge on these issues. He was absolutely right to focus on the way in which some industries operated in the past, and the extent to which the financial services industry had some very negative selling practices back in the deregulatory period of the 1980s. I am pleased that the industry, with Government assistance, has very much got its house in order.</p>
	<p pid="c.372.0/5">We would be well advised to think about the impact of the changes on the professionalism of very important industries such as financial services. If decisions are not taken in professional enough a way, they can have massive effects on people at the time in their life when they take their pension. Back in the 1980s, there was a huge explosion of private pensions, with people&#8212;mineworkers or teachers&#8212;advised to give up their pensions. They were told, &#8220;No, if you give up your pension, you can opt in to one of these private schemes, with 15% growth every year.&#8221; There was a huge mis-selling scandal.</p>
	<p pid="c.372.0/6">I previously worked&#8212;briefly, and largely unheralded&#8212;in the financial services industry. I was not necessarily particularly suited for the job, which highlights a point about people being invited into the industry. They were dragged into it on the basis of knowing friends that they could go and sell pensions to. People with very little knowledge came into the industry. Their business plan was based on phoning all their friends and relatives to encourage them to give up their pensions in reliable public sector or other schemes and to go in to private</p>
	<p pid="c.372.0/7">schemes. There was of course a huge explosion, and many of the people in the schemes were seen to have been given very poor advice.</p>
	<p pid="c.372.0/8">We recognise what the Government are attempting to achieve, and we support their aims of having greater flexibility for the industry, allowing people to be put back in charge of their investment and ensuring that they have the freedom to decide what to do with the money that they have saved. However, we are also aware of why the annuities method of accessing pensions that people had invested in was introduced. We as a society decided that, in an age when people were living longer and longer, we wanted people to make provision for themselves and, having done so, to buy something that provided a regular income that they could rely on.</p>
	<p pid="c.372.0/9">If we have a scheme in which people decide what to invest their pension funds in, but, with the best of intentions, those investments go wrong, the people who we thought had provided for themselves in later life will come back to the state and say, &#8220;Unfortunately, the investments that I made with my pension pot have gone wrong and I have run out of money.&#8221; That will have an impact on the Government. We recognise what the Government are attempting to achieve, but it would be sensible to have a review of how it is working, the impact of the changes on the behaviour of investors, the impact on Government revenues, the impact on the broader economy, and what behaviours are being encouraged and introduced by the changes.</p>

	<p pid="c.373.0/1">I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will accept that there is also a reputational danger for the industry in general and for the entire system of retirement pensions if people who make honest and sincere investments find that the returns are non-existent or that the investment itself disappears, and find themselves not being at leisure in their 70s, but working, like people I know.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-12-03c.373.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40165" speakername="Toby Perkins" colnum="373"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141203/debtext/141203-0003.htm#141203-0003.htm_spnew16">
	<p pid="c.373.1/1">Absolutely; the hon. Gentleman is right. There was a huge rush of those issues coming to light at the back end of the last century, when people who believed that they had saved into corporate pensions found that the company had disappeared and so had their pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/2">When we are debating these issues and supporting the Government in this important initiative, we must be conscious that it must not end up with people effectively gambling with the income that they will rely on, without being aware of the risks. It is important that protections are in place to ensure that when people make such decisions, they have the information and know what they are letting themselves in for. It must be clear not only what impact it will have on them and their future, but what impact it will have on Government resources and revenues.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/3">The FCA risk outlook of 2014 stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/4">&#8220;Retirement income products and distribution may deliver poor consumer outcomes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/5">That means that the Government recognise the dangers that we are highlighting, which adds more weight to the call of my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun for a review of the impact on Government revenue and a review of who is affected, with a</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/6">&#8220;distributional impact, by income decile of the population&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/7">The other thing that we must all be conscious of is that this change must not result in an industry that services only the very rich. Financial advice is important. If it becomes the preserve of the very rich, many people will be left out of the market, especially the self-employed, who often see their business as their pension and so never go down the route of choosing financial services products.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/8">In supporting my hon. Friend&#8217;s call for a review of the impact of the changes, I wanted to flag up the debate that we will be having later and to put it in the context of the taxation of pensions. I have secured today&#8217;s Adjournment debate on the impact of such measures on public sector workers who transferred to the private sector when their public sector job was transferred. They are protected under transfer of undertakings protocols. However, as many staff at CSC in Chesterfield who previously worked for Royal Mail discovered, when they were made redundant, the changes hastily introduced by the Government in 2012-13 meant that although they left their pension with Royal Mail when they were transferred and opened a new pension with CSC, that new pension was treated as a second pension. As far as they were concerned, they sat in the same desks and did the same job. The name above the door may have changed from Royal Mail to CSC&#8212;although in this case it did not in practical terms&#8212;but those staff were classed as having two different jobs and therefore two different pensions.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/9">Taxation on those schemes was set up to recognise a fair balance and provide Government support for people to invest in pensions. At the same time, people were investing huge amounts and receiving a fair amount of rebate, although not an excessive amount. Many employees in my constituency&#8212;and, I suspect, other public sector employees across the country&#8212;are being taxed because they were made redundant, and they will get a pension for a short period until their original pension kicks in at the age of 60. In practical terms they are receiving an annuity over several years, but the Treasury judges that as a one-off lump sum payment. People are taxed as though they have received a huge amount of money, when in practical terms a huge amount of money has been put aside for the next 10, 15, 20 or however many years it may be. In some cases people have paid as much as &#163;200,000 tax on a payment that is not in their pocket at that time.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/10">I do not want to preview the Adjournment debate too widely, although we do want to generate interest in it, but my case is that although the Government have attempted to introduce steps to alleviate such impacts, they are actually mitigating the unfairness rather than dealing with its cause, which is the way the Treasury taxes pensions that are effectively a second pension on the same job because of changes made by someone&#8217;s employer, rather than any decision by the employee.</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/11">I hope that the Minister will consider whether those issues might wisely be investigated within the rules on taxation of pension, although I recognise that we will not debate that today. New clause 2 is important to ensure a review of what is being proposed. Although that review will be conducted by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" name="Edward Balls">the Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls)</phrase>, because he will be Chancellor by the time the new clause is</p>
	<p pid="c.373.1/12">implemented in 2017, we must ensure that our pensions policy has no unintended consequences such as we have seen before on occasion.</p>

	<p pid="c.375.0/1">This may not be the most prominent Treasury matter gripping the nation today, but as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> said, it is none the less an important Bill and I am grateful for the opportunity to make further progress and respond to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/2">New clauses 1 and 2, tabled by the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, require the Treasury to publish two reviews of the impact of the Bill. The first review would focus on Exchequer revenues, including the use of salary sacrifice arrangements, income tax receipts and national insurance contributions. The second review would include the distributional impacts by income decile of the population of the pensions flexibility measures; the impact on Exchequer revenue of measures contained within schedule 2, which makes various changes to the taxation of pensions at death; a behavioural analysis; an analysis of the cumulative impact on Exchequer revenues; and an analysis of the impact on the purchase of annuities. An amendment has been tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40045" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase>, which would, as we have heard, require the Government to undertake an analysis of the impact of the changes introduced in the Bill on the housing market.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/3">I would like to explain&#8212;I suspect this will not come as a huge shock to hon. Members&#8212;why the new clauses are unnecessary. There are a number of reasons. First, on considering new clause 1 and the parts of new clause 2 that relate to Exchequer revenues, it is important to note that the Government have today published estimates of the Exchequer impacts of the policy as a whole. These costings, which have been certified by the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, cover all the changes we have made to the policy since Budget as a result of consultation. I know hon. Members have been concerned about the potential consequences for the Exchequer of the new freedoms. The Government published costings at Budget. I have been clear that we would update the costings to reflect the policy decisions that have been taken since then. A great deal of the debate has rightly focused on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/4">The Government have taken a number of policy decisions since pension flexibility was announced in March. Those decisions are: introducing a &#163;10,000 annual allowance for those who have flexibly accessed a pension pot of more than &#163;10,000; changing the rules on the taxation of pensions at death; and continuing to allow transfers out of funded defined benefit schemes. Today, as part of the autumn statement, the Government have also confirmed that the notional income rules for assessing eligibility for means-tested benefits will be more generous by assuming that unspent pension savings generate the same income as an annuity, rather than 150% of an annuity as at present. Of course, not all of these measures are contained within the Bill, but I believe that they are relevant to any debate on the fiscal impacts of flexibility. To ensure the Government are being sufficiently transparent, I have today taken the step of writing to members of the former Public Bill Committee to set out further details of the costings. I will now outline those costings to the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/5">At Budget 2014, the Government published costings that stated that freedom of choice would cost the Exchequer minus &#163;5 million in 2014-15, and from then on would raise money: &#163;320 million in 2015-16, &#163;600 million in 2016-17, &#163;910 million in 2017-18, &#163;1.22 billion in 2018-19, and &#163;810 million in 2019-20. The overall impact of decisions taken since the policy was announced in March does not significantly alter the numbers published at Budget. As set out in my letter to the Committee and in table 2.1 of the autumn statement document, the decisions I have just described will have the following Exchequer impacts: they will raise &#163;60 million in 2015-16, cost &#163;25 million in both 2016-17 and 2017-18, raise &#163;30 million in 2018-19, and cost &#163;10 million in 2019-20. Further detail on how those costs have been calculated is set out in the policy costings document, which has been published today alongside the autumn statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/6">In my letter to Committee members, I explained that the costings published today as part of the autumn statement were based on the same central assumptions that underpinned the costings published at the Budget. Since the Budget, the Government have explored in more detail two aspects of the policy affecting the costing: the increased costs of salary sacrifice and welfare as a result of the reforms&#8212;two points that the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun dwelt on. The Government have produced these costings and they have been scrutinised by the OBR.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/7">In line with standard practice, these are accounted for as changes to the forecast and so are not outlined in table 2.1 of the autumn statement document. In recognition of the concern raised by Members about the likely impact on the Exchequer, I included the Government&#8217;s estimate of the costs in my letter to the Committee, but I will set them out again to the House. The revisions to the forecast to account for salary sacrifice are: minus &#163;5 million in 2014-15; minus &#163;35 million in 2015-16; minus &#163;30 million in 2016-17; and minus &#163;25 million in 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20. The revisions to the forecast to account for the increased cost of welfare are: minus &#163;10 million in 2015-16; minus &#163;15 million in 2016-17; minus &#163;20 million in 2017-18; and minus &#163;25 million in 2018-19 and 2019-20.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/8">The Government have, therefore, already published the information the two new clauses seek on the Exchequer impacts of the various aspects of flexibility, and all that information has been certified by the independent OBR. In addition, the Government have already committed to keeping the policy under review, through the monitoring of information collected on tax returns and tax records, and HMRC regularly publishes data on tax receipts reflecting any impact on the Exchequer. Any such impacts will be reflected in forecasts at fiscal events.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/9">The Government keep tax policy under continual review. There is no need for further reviews of the Exchequer impacts of the policy, because the Government have already committed to keeping them under review through usual processes, and I hope that this will reassure hon. Members regarding the fiscal impacts of measures in the Bill and related policies. At the very least, I hope hon. Members will appreciate that, given this debate has occurred after the autumn statement, I have been able to provide some of the answers the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun was seeking in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/10">New clause 2 would also require the Government to review the distributional impact of the measures in the Bill no less than 18 months after the Bill takes effect. As I set out in Committee, the measures in the Bill do not have a direct consequential impact on household incomes. Distributional effects will be driven by the choices individuals make about how and when to take their pension. In addition, household income is not necessarily a reliable measure of pension wealth, particularly in the years immediately prior to retirement. The impacts of the policy could be misrepresented were we to review them only against the distribution of household income. I appreciate I made that argument in Committee, but it was a good argument then, and it is a good argument now.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/11">In addition, new clause 2 would require the Government to publish behavioural analysis. As discussed in Committee, the costing of tax policies often involves an assessment of the behavioural impacts of the measure and, in some cases, the capacity for additional tax planning and avoidance behaviour. These assumptions and methodologies are certified by the independent OBR, but the Treasury considers that making these detailed behavioural assumptions public might affect the behaviour they relate to and so could be detrimental to policy making.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/12">As I mentioned in relation to the Exchequer impact of the changes to the taxation of pensions at death, a policy costing note published alongside the autumn statement explains how the costings have been calculated. This is in line with the principles outlined in the Government document, &#8220;Tax policy making: a new approach&#8221;, published alongside the June 2010 Budget.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/13">New clause 2 would require the Government to review any impact the measures in the Bill might have on the volume of annuity purchases. Considering the policy intent of the changes, this would be unnecessary and inappropriate. These measures are not intended to encourage savers towards or away from any particular product over another. They are intended to offer savers greater choice and flexibility about how they use their hard-earned savings to fund their retirement.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/14">The Government have always said that they believe annuities will continue to be the right choice for many people at some point in their retirement, as many people will value the security of the guaranteed income. However, the Government do not believe it appropriate to mandate that individuals should use their lifetime savings to purchase any one specific financial product. As I set out in Committee, data on the sale of annuities will continue to be available through other channels&#8212;the data published by trade bodies and publications by individual firms, for example&#8212;and there is no need for the Government to duplicate this.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/15">A further amendment has been tabled by the hon. Member for Arfon, which would require the Government to undertake</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/16">&#8220;an analysis of the impact of the changes introduced by this Act on the housing market&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/17">This appears to stem from a concern that the Government&#8217;s changes will have an adverse impact on the housing market. With greater choice and flexibility at the point</p>
	<p pid="c.375.0/18">of retirement, people will be allowed to make a decision about their finances that is right for them. This Government are committed to making the aspiration of home ownership a reality for as many people as possible. That is why they have introduced policies such as Help to Buy and further measures announced in the Budget to support the supply of housing. As part of the new regulatory framework for financial services, the Government have introduced the Financial Policy Committee to ensure that risks stemming from the housing market are identified and early mitigating action taken, if required.</p>

	<p pid="c.378.0/1">Does the Minister recognise that the point at which many people draw their pensions, particularly the lump sum element, is the very point at which they might wish to help their children get into the housing market, and that we should not do anything to prevent that?</p>

	<p pid="c.378.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important and relevant point. We are putting power in the hands of individuals to decide what they do with their retirement pension pot. We are also ensuring&#8212;I shall touch on this in a moment&#8212;that guidance is available. It may well be that after careful consideration, people conclude that they do want to assist a family member to get into the housing market. That is a choice for them, and I do not think that we here should necessarily condemn such a choice: it might be precisely the right thing for people to do for them and their family.</p>
	<p pid="c.378.1/2">As part of the new regulatory framework for financial services, we have introduced the Financial Policy Committee, as I was saying, and we have given the FPC strong powers to tackle any threat to financial stability, including a broad power of recommendation, which it used in June 2014 to address risks stemming from mortgage lending and sectoral capital requirements that apply to residential mortgage lending. The Government have consulted on granting the FPC powers of direction over macro-prudential tools for the housing market and aim to legislate for these new powers next year. In line with the new regulatory framework, the FPC is best placed to monitor the housing market and take action, if required.</p>
	<p pid="c.378.1/3">Let me pick some other points raised in the debate, most of which it would be fair to say were familiar. I was asked whether people would understand the tax consequences involved. The guidance will help consumers to understand the tax implications of their choice of pension, and in addition, the Financial Conduct Authority has published near final rules that will require providers to supply their customers with a description of the possible tax implications when they apply to access their pension funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.378.1/4">On extortionate draw-down charges, the FCA&#8217;s retirement income market study will be published shortly. In June, the FCA expanded the scope of this study to include consideration of products in the new flexible landscape and to identify any competition risks and potential consumer detriment. The guidance guarantee will be relevant here.</p>
	<p pid="c.378.1/5">It was suggested that people might be charged too much tax without realising it. As with all PAYE income, the tax position will be reconciled at the end of the tax year. All the income received by an individual that was taxed under PAYE will be brought together, and the</p>
	<p pid="c.378.1/6">correct tax will then be calculated. If there was an overpayment, the extra amount will be repaid, and if there was an underpayment, HMRC will contact the individual. People will not be subject to self-assessment solely because they have flexibly accessed their pensions, nor will they have to claim a refund in order to receive it.</p>
	<p pid="c.378.1/7">I have already touched on the matter of how the new flexibilities will affect entitlements to benefits, but let me say now that the Government want to ensure that the choice that people make between taking their pensions as income&#8212;that is, purchasing an annuity and keeping more of their pension as capital&#8212;and drawing it down periodically, for example through a drawdown product, will not have a significant impact on how they are assessed for social care support and how their means are assessed for social security purposes. New regulations and statutory guidance on the Care Act 2014, which were published on <phrase class="date" code="2014-10-23">23 October</phrase>, include details about the charging rules for care and support.</p>
	<p pid="c.378.1/8">Today we announced a change in the rules for people above pension credit qualifying age who claim means-tested benefits. The notional income amount applied to pension pots that have not been used to purchase an annuity will be reduced from 150% to 100% of the income of an equivalent annuity&#8212;or the actual income taken, if that is higher&#8212;in line with the rules for care and support.</p>
	<p pid="c.378.1/9">Let me now deal with an issue that was raised by the hon. Members for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins). I shall not try to anticipate the response that my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary to the Treasury will make to the Adjournment debate that the hon. Gentleman will initiate later, but I can say that these matters are not being rushed. We have consulted extensively on the implementation of the policy, and there is widespread support for the changes. We are working closely with industry to ensure that it is ready for April 2015, and have been doing so since the announcement was made. We are making good progress in delivering the changes that are needed through both our Bills.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-12-03c.379.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40559" speakername="David Gauke" colnum="379"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141203/debtext/141203-0003.htm#141203-0003.htm_spnew20">
	<p pid="c.379.1/1">We are reaching the end of the Commons process, or at least I hope we are. We believe that the Bill delivers the reforms that are necessary to implement the policy announcement that the Chancellor made in the last Budget. We believe that these are good reforms, and we believe that the new flexibility in the pensions system is to be welcomed and will encourage greater savings. Let me add that some perceive Opposition Members&#8217; desire for a review as the precursor of a possible reversal of these changes by the Opposition, were they to be in government. I would not like that to happen, and their proposals create a degree of uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="c.379.1/2">I hope that, in the light of the explanations that I have given to the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, she will not press her new clause to a Division, but if she does, I will certainly oppose it.</p>

	<p pid="c.380.0/1">The new clauses ask for reviews and monitoring, and that is exactly what we want. As we have said repeatedly during the Bill&#8217;s passage so far, our proposals should not be interpreted in any other way. When a Bill is put before us, it is important for us to scrutinise it and try to improve it, and that was my reason for tabling the new clauses.</p>
	<p pid="c.380.0/2">I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40186" name="Geoffrey Robinson">the Member for Coventry North West (Mr Robinson)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40165" name="Toby Perkins">the Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40045" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase> for their contributions. All of them have contributed additional information and raised additional issues which need to be considered, particularly my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield, who will initiate an Adjournment debate later. He did not want to reveal too much about that debate, lest we decide to miss his exciting speech. None the less, he did an excellent job in laying out some of the issues that he will refer to later on behalf of his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="c.380.0/3">I have listened to the Minister. I am disappointed&#8212;as always&#8212;that he has not chosen to accept new clause 1 and new clause 2. On reflection, having listened to the debate, I am minded to press new clause 1 to the vote, but not to press new clause 2 at this stage.</p>

	<p pid="c.384.3/1">Amendments 1 to 8 are all of a minor and technical nature, amending various definitions and removing unnecessary sections. I would be happy to explain those in more detail if hon. Members are interested, but if they are not, I will move on to amendments 9 to 39.</p>
	<p pid="c.384.3/2">As hon. Members will recall, we had a very useful debate in Committee about the new information requirements for individuals that are set out in part 6 of schedule 1 of the Bill. I said at the time that the Government were keen to work with industry and consumer groups to ensure that the requirements are proportionate, and that we would consider the issue further. We have therefore continued to have constructive discussions with the pensions industry about the impacts of the Bill. As a result of this ongoing consultation, we have tabled a number of amendments that we believe are a proportionate response to the concerns raised. These changes will make the reporting requirements that individuals need to meet easier to comply with, while still ensuring that they have access to the right information to help them pay the right amount of tax. Government amendments 9 to 39 therefore make a number of changes to the information requirements in the Bill to provide that individuals have to tell schemes that they have flexibly accessed their pension savings only if they are an active member of that scheme, and to increase the time they have to comply from 31 days to 91 days.</p>
	<p pid="c.384.3/3">It might be helpful if I start by setting out why these information requirements are required. As we have discussed many times during the course of this Bill&#8217;s passage through the House, when an individual accesses their pension flexibly, their annual allowance for tax-relieved defined contribution pension contributions will reduce from &#163;40,000 to &#163;10,000. That will protect the Exchequer and ensure that the new system cannot be exploited to achieve unintended tax advantages by individuals&#8217; diverting their salary into their pension and withdrawing it immediately with tax relief. It is therefore important that individuals understand the tax consequences of saving into a pension after accessing their savings flexibly. For that reason, the Bill placed a new requirement on individuals to tell all their pension providers once they had flexibly accessed a pension. This was intended to ensure that individuals do not use the new system to gain a tax advantage that is not intended. However, the</p>
	<p pid="c.384.3/4">Government have always been clear that they are keen to ensure these requirements are proportionate. Having considered the issue carefully, we are amending the Bill to provide that people need to tell only the schemes to which they are contributing or that they contribute to in the future. They will also have an extended period of 91 days in which to do so. These changes will make the new system easier for individuals and schemes to comply with, while also ensuring that the new annual allowance is implemented effectively. Again, I would be happy to explain these amendments in more detail if hon. Members are interested.</p>

	<p pid="c.385.0/1">I am certainly not asking the Minister to explain all this in a lot more detail and detain the House in doing so. One specific point raised in Committee was that people contributing to a workplace defined benefit scheme will not know how much of their annual allowance is being used in that scheme at the time when they are able to make contributions to a defined contribution scheme. Has he considered the possibility that such people could be treated&#8212;I think the Bill tends to do this&#8212;as though they are deliberately trying to avoid tax, whereas they may just have a lack of knowledge at the time they do this?</p>

	<p pid="c.385.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. There will be particular issues with defined benefit schemes. It may be that individuals do not know when contributions are paid by their employer. Where the scheme provides defined benefits only, the information requirement does not apply, and individuals will never need to notify it. If the scheme also provides money purchase benefits&#8212;for example, if it has a separate AVC section&#8212;the requirement can only apply where contributions are made to the AVC section. Defined benefit schemes are excluded as they will not have to send pension saving statements to the individual based on the &#163;10,000 money purchase annual allowance. I hope that helps my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.1/2">As I have set out, we have tabled a small number of minor and technical amendments to ensure that the Bill works as intended. We have also tabled amendments to make the reporting requirements easier to comply with while still achieving their purpose of ensuring that individuals have access to the right information to help them pay the right amount of tax. I hope that these changes will be welcomed by the House and that amendments 1 to 39 will be made to schedule 1.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-12-03c.385.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" colnum="385"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141203/debtext/141203-0003.htm#141203-0003.htm_spnew27">
	<p pid="c.385.2/1">I thank the Minister for bringing forward these amendments. We had a fair amount of debate and discussion in Committee on some of the issues, so I am not intending to ask him to go through each amendment, especially the minor and technical ones, in great detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.2/2">I recognise that Government amendments 9 to 39 were brought forward as a result of the comments and concerns that we and the industry raised on the reporting requirements. The Bill as introduced placed a requirement on individuals who access their pension flexibly to inform all schemes of which they are a member that they are subject to the new &#163;10,000 allowance. They would have been required to do that within 31 days of</p>
	<p pid="c.385.2/3">receiving a statement from their pension scheme and, as we said in Committee, failure to comply could lead to them being fined.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.2/4">We pointed out in Committee that it was unreasonable to expect individuals to dig up information on schemes that they might not have paid into for many years and to which the annual allowance rules were therefore unlikely to apply. We also pointed out, with reference to evidence from both Ros Altmann and the Association of Taxation Technicians, that the 31-day time frame was a short and unreasonable deadline. The Government amendments change that, so that individuals will be required only to tell schemes to which they are currently contributing, or subsequently contribute to, that they are subject to the &#163;10,000 annual allowance. They also change the length of time that individuals have to comply with this requirement to 91 days.</p>
	<p pid="c.385.2/5">We welcome the Government amendments. Although we may not have persuaded the Minister to take on all our concerns, we are glad to have played some small part in persuading him to make those changes and to bring forward those amendments today. As I have said, we welcome and support them.</p>

	<p pid="c.392.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="c.392.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">The House has reached the final stage of its consideration of the Bill, which will give individuals more choice about how they access their savings in retirement. I have been pleased by our wide-ranging and informed debates.</p>
	<p pid="c.392.0/3">I would like to remind hon. Members of the measures in the Bill and their aims. While the Bill makes the tax system fairer by ensuring that people have more choice about how they access their savings, it contains measures to prevent individuals from exploiting that new flexibility to gain an unintended tax advantage, and to ensure that the taxation of pensions savings on death remains fair and appropriate under the new system.</p>
	<p pid="c.392.0/4">At Budget 2014, the Chancellor announced the most radical reform to how people take their private pensions for nearly 100 years. The current system restricts choice at the point of retirement. Those with the smallest and largest amounts of pension savings are allowed flexibility, but those with a medium amount of savings have very limited options. The Bill will change that by extending flexibility to everyone with a defined contribution pension, regardless of their total pension savings.</p>
	<p pid="c.392.0/5">The Bill also introduces a new method to allow people to access their pension flexibly. At present, people taking their pension as cash have to take all their tax-free lump sum&#8212;25% of their fund&#8212;and then place the other 75% in a draw-down fund. Any money they then take out of that fund will be taxed at their marginal rate.</p>
	<p pid="c.392.0/6">The uncrystallised funds pension lump sum&#8212;UFPLUS &#8212;is a new option that will give individuals the flexibility to take one or more lump sums from their pension fund without having to enter into draw-down or to take all their tax-free lump sum in one go. When using that option, 25% of each payment will be tax-free, with the other 75% taxed at the individual&#8217;s marginal rate. We are also increasing choice by introducing changes to encourage innovation in the retirement income market. Following extensive consultation with the industry, the Bill will give providers scope to make annuities much more flexible products in line with consumers&#8217; needs.</p>
	<p pid="c.392.0/7">I have already discussed the fiscal impacts of those measures and related ones today, but I reiterate that the Government have now published Office for Budget Responsibility-certified costings for the policy overall alongside the autumn statement.</p>

	<p pid="c.393.0/1">My hon. Friend will remember, as I do, that one of the first acts of the previous Labour Government on coming to power was to put a tax on pensions that helped to destroy the healthiest, strongest and most successful pension system in Europe. This Government, however, in much less promising economic times, have managed to bring flexibility and hope to all those who save for a secure retirement.</p>

	<p pid="c.393.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for helpfully reminding the House of that important point. It is a significant achievement of the Government that we have been able to undertake such a fundamental reform&#8212;perhaps the biggest for nearly 100 years&#8212;in this area. Our record compares favourably with that of our predecessor. Of course, the Bill is part of a wider set of Government reforms, including the single-tier pension, the rolling out of auto-enrolment and the triple-lock guarantee.</p>

	<p pid="c.393.5/1">Something like 320,000 people retire each year with defined contribution schemes, and those people will now have far more choice. Of course, people who are saving for their pensions will know that at the end of their working life, or at various points after the age of 55, they will have more flexibility with regard to their pension pot.</p>
	<p pid="c.393.5/2">I am grateful for the interesting debates that we have had during the Bill&#8217;s passage through the House and I would like to reflect briefly on how it has changed since its introduction. The Government's recently tabled amendment regarding how individuals inform schemes if the &#163;10,000 annual allowance applies to them will provide that people only need to tell schemes to which they are contributing, or contribute to in the future, when they access a pension flexibly. They will also have an extended time period of 91 days in which to do so. These changes will make the new system easier for individuals and schemes to comply with, while ensuring that the annual allowance is implemented effectively.</p>
	<p pid="c.393.5/3">The Government have made a number of minor and technical amendments to the Bill to ensure that it works as intended. The most substantive changes have been to the taxation of pensions at death, to ensure that that taxation remains fair and appropriate under the new system. The changes will allow individuals who die with pension funds remaining to pass those funds on to anyone they choose. The funds can be paid tax-free if the individual dies before the age of 75; if they die having reached that age, and the funds are paid out as a pension, they will be taxed at the beneficiary&#8217;s marginal rate&#8212;or at 45%, if the funds are paid as a lump sum.</p>
	<p pid="c.393.5/4">The aim of the changes is to ensure that individuals who have made sacrifices to save over the course of their life can pass on their pension savings without worrying about excessive tax charges after they die. They also preserve the incentive for people to keep money in their pension, as there will not be the fear of their beneficiaries being hit by a 55% tax charge.</p>
	<p pid="c.393.5/5">Members may be interested to note that today, in the autumn statement, the Chancellor announced that the changes will extend to annuities. Death benefit payments from joint life and guaranteed term annuities will also be tax-free when the policyholder dies before the age of 75; such death benefits can be paid to any beneficiary. That will also apply when an individual uses uncrystallised or draw-down funds inherited from someone who dies before the age of 75 to buy a dependant&#8217;s annuity. Those changes will be legislated for in due course, although not through this Bill. In conclusion, the Bill is important. It will increase choice at retirement for individuals who have saved all their lives. It contains measures to prevent individuals from using the new flexibilities to gain unintended tax consequences, and ensures that the tax treatment of pensions on death remains fair.</p>
	<p pid="c.393.5/6">Finally, I thank hon. Members who participated in debates on the Bill, both in the Chamber and in Committee. In particular, I would like to mention the diligence of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase>, who has, I think, accounted for significantly more than 50% of the time taken to scrutinise the Bill. As I said, the Bill increases choice for the 320,000 people retiring each year, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.394.0/1">It is with a heavy heart that I rise to speak for the last time on the Taxation of Pensions Bill. It has been such an enjoyable experience. I am not quite sure how I will fill my days in the next few weeks, given that I will no longer be poring over absolutely every detail of the legislation. It does not seem long ago that I spoke on Second Reading&#8212;in fact, it was only two short months ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/2">I should like to start where the Minister ended&#8212;by thanking everyone who has been involved in the process. I particularly thank right hon. and hon. Friends who have supported me in scrutinising the Bill, including in Committee, not least my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase>, who kept us all in line. Whenever I was about to take perhaps more than my fair share of time, he would keep me on track. I thank the Clerks in the Public Bill Office for their drafting advice and the role they played in ensuring that amendments were tabled in the appropriate manner. I also thank Library staff, who were excellent as always; they efficiently answered all my questions and responded to all my additional requests for information.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/3">I thank the Minister&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>I was going to say that he has, at all times, been polite and courteous; I hope he hears that I am saying something reasonably nice about him. That is not always how things happen. Throughout proceedings on the Bill, he has said no to pretty much all our requests and new clauses, in the nicest possible way. As I have said when speaking to our new clauses and amendments, we have been very consistent in our approach to the reforms; we have been clear that</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/4">we support the principle of the Bill. We support increased flexibility and choice for savers, and that is why we have long advocated reform to the annuities market to help people to shop around and get a better deal. But we have had concerns about the speed at which the reforms have been pushed through. There was no consultation prior to the Budget statement and it has been difficult at times to get to grips with all the figures and the behavioural impacts relating to the Bill because the Government were not able to publish that analysis.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/5">Nevertheless, we have endeavoured to identify the potential problems that the Bill presents, and we have judged everything against the three tests that we set at the outset&#8212;the advice test to ensure that savers get the right guidance, the fairness test to ensure that there are decent products for low and middle income savers, and the cost test to ensure that the reforms do not result in extra pressures on the state. It will be difficult to measure the Bill&#8217;s performance against those tests until the reforms take effect. We therefore reserve judgment on how it will work.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/6">The Minister recapped the key issues that we debated. We made our views on the guidance guarantee abundantly clear. There is not a great deal more that we can say about that until we see how it works in practice. Ensuring that guidance meets customer expectation and requirements is a responsibility that now resides firmly with the Government. Our new clauses, which the Minister rejected, were concerned with measuring and reviewing the impact of the Bill because we wanted to gauge the degree to which the reforms produce additional opportunities for tax avoidance and to ensure that the Minister continues to monitor the impact of the Bill carefully as it is implemented.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/7">We did not press new clause 2 to the vote. It called for a comprehensive review of the impact of the reforms, to be published 18 months after they take effect. We were keen to ensure that the Minister had every opportunity to give us the facts and figures. With the autumn statement today and the publication of the OBR policy costings, we now have some of that information and some of the numbers that we did not have previously.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/8">There is one issue that I wish to raise even at this late stage. The Minister mentioned earlier that the OBR has run the rule over the figures, but it is important to note that the OBR policy costings document refers on page 87 to seven measures in the policy decisions table that are judged to have high or very high uncertainty around the central costing. Interestingly, one of those seven measures is pensions flexibility. The document refers to decisions since Budget 2014 and goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/9">&#8220;This costing receives a &#8216;very high&#8217; uncertainty rating. The yield over the scorecard period&#8212;and the resulting costs in the longer term&#8212;depends on take-up and on other behavioural responses. Some people will temporarily increase pension saving in order to benefit from tax-free lump sum withdrawals. It is possible that funds will be redirected from annuities and into other assets, such as other financial products or housing. It is also possible that such funds could be used to finance consumer spending&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/10">That is exactly what we have been highlighting throughout the Bill proceedings, and exactly why we felt it was important that a review was built into the process. I hope that if the Minister does not take my word for it, although he often did so graciously, he will take account of the OBR&#8217;s comments.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/11">We are clear that the success of the Bill will depend on the tests of fairness and cost that we set out. If the reforms have adverse consequences for those on middle or lower incomes or those who cannot afford the expensive regulated advice, they will not have succeeded. If the reforms lead to higher costs for the state because people have accessed their pensions too early and need additional state support, they will, again, not have succeeded. We hope the Government have factored in all the potential consequences, as they have assured us. I am pleased that they listened to us on the reporting requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/12">Does the Bill not look much better since the Government showed some flexibility in their approach? The word &#8220;flexibility&#8221; was frequently used in our discussions because that is what the Bill is all about. Had the Government taken their own advice and been a little more flexible in their approach from the outset, and perhaps a little less hasty, we might have arrived at a position where the Bill had been significantly improved and some of the outstanding questions could have been answered.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/13">However, we have had a relatively short period to consider the Bill, notwithstanding the fact that, as the Minister pointed out, I seem to have taken up in excess of 50% of the time available to make the points. I think that it is the Opposition&#8217;s duty to scrutinise thoroughly, raise the issues, ensure that the Government have thought things through, press them on those points and lay out those areas where we think they need to continue to monitor and evaluate in future.</p>
	<p pid="c.394.0/14">With those few words, the time has run out for those of us in this place. I would like to close by reiterating my thanks to everyone who has worked on the Bill. I have found this an interesting and enjoyable process&#8212;perhaps not everyone involved would agree&#8212;and I must say that I never thought I would say that about a Bill on pensions taxation.</p>

	<p pid="c.396.0/1">I will not detain the House for long, but, as the Liberal Democrat representative here, I feel that it is important to say something. The Bill supports the pensions revolution being driven by the Minister for Pensions, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase>, who has done a terrific job. We are well aware, of course, that the main pension aspects of the regulations are in the Department for Work and Pensions Bill, not in this Treasury Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.396.0/2">Like the shadow Minister, I enjoyed serving on the Bill Committee. In this place we are often very adversarial, but I think that proceedings on the Bill have been conducted in absolutely the right spirit. When it comes to pensions, it is extremely important to have cross-party support for the arrangements agreed, because pensions, by definition, involve long-term decisions. Were we to keep trying to change the pensions system every year or two, we would not be giving people certainty on what to do about their future. It has been a real pleasure to serve on a Bill on which, although we have sparred over various details, there has been strong agreement on the need to pass it. It has the full support of the Liberal Democrats.</p>

	<p pid="c.398.2/1">I am pleased to have this opportunity to bring to the House&#8217;s attention a matter of significant importance to employees in my constituency who were transferred out of Royal Mail to the IT services provider Computer Sciences Corporation and, I suspect, to many other employees who were transferred out of the public sector. Changes to lump sum pension allowances introduced by the Chancellor in his 2013 Budget have had a catastrophic impact on my constituents&#8217; pension pots and created an accidental discrimination that fits neither the principles nor the spirit of the transfer of undertakings protocol, otherwise known as TUPE.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/2">The aim of this debate is to follow up letters I have exchanged with the Financial Secretary to the Treasury. I feel that his replies thus far have failed to grasp the full unfairness of the situation or to offer appropriate remedy. I aim to show the House that, as the mechanism currently stands, there is gross unfairness towards workers who have been transferred out of public sector pension schemes. I hope that the Minister, when she responds, can explain to my constituents why they have been hit with such a significant tax bill, often on revenues that they have not even yet received, and what further steps the Government can take to ensure that former public sector workers are not unfairly disadvantaged by an arbitrary decision they made several years ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/3">Royal Mail has had a long tradition in my constituency. Back in the 1960s, as part of a move to get Government organisations out into the provinces, Royal Mail moved thousands of head office staff up to Chesterfield. It brought with it a Barbara Hepworth statue and a welcome number of high-skilled and pretty well-paid jobs. Royal Mail has been a key employer in the town ever since. The Loundsley Green housing estate was built specifically to house the influx of new workers. However, while it remains an important employer today, many staff have subsequently been transferred out and do the same or similar jobs working on the Royal Mail account on behalf of private outsourcing companies.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/4">The workers whose case I am raising today were transferred from Royal Mail to the IT firm Computer Sciences Corporation Ltd&#8212;CSC&#8212;in 2003 as part of a contract to outsource all Royal Mail&#8217;s IT to the company and retain all the 1,713 staff under the TUPE protocol. At that time, employees had a choice either to leave pension contributions that they had already paid within the Royal Mail pension and start a new separate corporate pension with future contributions with their new employer, or to transfer all their contributions to a new CSC pension and subsequently pay into that. The only choice that appeared to face workers was whether their pension contributions would be safer in one scheme or another and where they would be most likely to get a decent return on the pension contributions to which they were entitled.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/5">Many workers&#8212;it is not clear how many&#8212;elected to keep their pre-2003 contributions within the Royal Mail scheme and open a new CSC pension with future</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/6">contributions. However, a combination of the changes to the allowance regime&#8212;which was dramatically reduced in October 2010 and further reduced in subsequent Budgets&#8212;enforcement of TUPE rights, previous changes made to the allowances on what are perceived to be temporary pensions, and Treasury guidance on what constitutes a temporary pension has led to huge costs being applied to workers made redundant from CSC in recent years.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/7">Revelations in Computerweekly.com about the efforts that CSC has made to stem losses on its involvement with the Royal Mail account suggest that 63% of the staff who originally transferred from Royal Mail into CSC have now been cut. Although exact numbers are not known, it is believed that the majority have left the business completely. That suggests that some 1,082 employees could be affected in this case alone. Some of those will have chosen to move into the CSC pension scheme and will not be affected in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/8">There appear to be two different ways in which workers have been disadvantaged. First, I would like to raise the case of Michael Randell. Michael had worked for Royal Mail Group for well over 25 years, during which he had saved for his retirement by contributing into the pension scheme. Mr Randell is now 53. Under the terms of his employment, had he remained a Royal Mail employee he would have been entitled to take his pension under early retirement provision if he had left the firm over the age of 50. Therefore, in order to comply with TUPE, CSC arranged to make a notional payment to source an equivalent pension value until he is 60, when he will move on to the Royal Mail pension. Mr Randell&#8217;s usual pension contributions are less than &#163;5,000 per year, but when he is made redundant, this one-off notional payment&#8212;which would effectively buy an annuity for the next seven years to comply with TUPE regulations, from CSC&#8217;s perspective&#8212;is classed by the Treasury as a one-year contribution to a second, in this case temporary, pension. In practical terms, it is not a second pension&#8212;it is a continuation of the first pension that he has from doing the same job with two separate employers.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/9">At a time when the Government rightly ask employees to put money aside to save for themselves in retirement and to plan ahead, this group of workers, who did precisely that, are being caused huge problems because, back in 2003, they made a decision about which pension scheme they should choose to contribute to, yet they could not possibly be expected to have had foresight as to the implications of that choice.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/10">The intention of the Government&#8217;s proposals was to target richer pensioners. In 2010, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40256" name="Mark Hoban">the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr Hoban)</phrase> announced:</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/11">&#8220;It will be targeted at those who make the most significant pension savings. An annual allowance of &#163;50,000 will affect 100,000 pension savers&#8212;80% of those will have incomes over &#163;100,000.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/12">Unfortunately, as Mr Randell&#8217;s case has shown, the policy has also hit those on lower incomes with reasonable pensions. The Government have accepted the possibility that individuals on lower incomes could in exceptional circumstances face a sharp increase in the tax charged on their pension, but as I have demonstrated, such moderate language does not reflect the significant numbers that might be affected or the size of the impact on their pension planning.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/13">The second example involves the group of CSC workers who were made redundant in 2012. That was part of a global redundancy programme in which CSC laid off 640 workers. The workers had their CSC pensions taxed as second pensions, whereas if, back in 2003, they had decided to transfer their pensions into the CSC pension scheme, it would all have been seen as the same scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/14">CSC attempted to honour its commitments to its employees by ensuring that they still received as employees of CSC what they would have been entitled to if they had remained with Royal Mail, but that led to those individuals being treated as though they had two separate pensions, although in practice they have been employed in the same job throughout that period. The issue is about how public sector workers whose employer changes, even though their job does not change, are seen as having two different jobs. Although TUPE should protect them from being worse off as a result, in practice they are not protected.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/15">The Treasury viewed the money as having been paid all at once, even though it was received by the workers annually over many years, and the way in which workers&#8217; pensions are taxed by the Treasury meant that people on decent but not in any sense exceptional salaries faced huge tax bills&#8212;more than &#163;200,000 in one case that I have heard of&#8212;on income that they had not necessarily received.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/16">It is too early to know the total number of people who will be sucked into this unfortunate state of affairs, but taking into account how many have moved from the public sector to the private sector, it might be very high. That raises important questions about the extent to which the Government fully understood the impact of the changes they made to the annual pension allowance when they made them.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/17">The Treasury document, &#8220;Restricting pensions tax relief through existing allowances: a summary of the discussion document responses&#8221;, revealed:</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/18">&#8220;The nature of DB schemes means that some individuals on moderate incomes could exceed the AA&#8212;particularly where they are in final salary DB schemes and see spikes in pension accrual&#8230; The Government is committed to managing impacts on these individuals as far as possible.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/19">One of these solutions was to allow individuals</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/20">&#8220;to carry-forward unused annual allowance from up to three previous years, to offset against contributions in excess of the AA in a single year.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/21">However, the Government recognised that in exceptional cases such mitigation would not be sufficient. The Financial Secretary made that clear in correspondence with me. He said at the time that the Government had consulted on options to give individuals and schemes more flexibility over the payment of charges. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-03">3 March 2011</phrase>, the Government announced that individuals with annual allowance charges of more than &#163;2,000 would be able to elect for the full liability to be met from their pension benefit. That obviously made it easier in the short term, but in practice it still means that individuals will lose out, as they receive a lower pension than they otherwise would have done. The fact that they are still taking money out of their future earnings to pay a bill does not seem to fit with the principle of the Government&#8217;s measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/22">It is ironic that this debate is taking place on the day that the House has again debated the Taxation of Pensions Bill, because the Bill was a missed opportunity</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/23">to address the plight of TUPE-ed public sector workers who face the unfairness that I have highlighted. The Government have thus far fallen short of the action that is required. The measures that have been put in place are compensatory, but they do not compensate fully. They mean that the workers of CSC and probably many other former public sector workers will lose out on the pension to which they should have been entitled.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/24">The further stages of the Taxation of Pensions Bill provide an opportunity to establish cross-party support for further analysing the effect that pension changes have had on CSC workers, and for setting out a framework in which the unfair nature of the situation can be tackled. I hope that that might happen in another place, as I suggested on Report. The Government&#8217;s approach to reforming pensions tax relief was supposed to be based on ensuring that fairness was maintained, but it appears that a loophole has developed that could, in some cases, lead to people losing thousands from their pension.</p>
	<p pid="c.398.2/25">I would be grateful if the Minister recognised that the measures to alleviate the problem are sticking plasters that aim to provide compensation or to reduce the damage of the proposals, and that what is required is for people who are perceived to have had two jobs, when in reality they had one, not to have to choose to pay a tax bill, which they would not have faced if they were still in the public sector, either all at once or from their future pension income. I look forward to hearing her response on this important issue. I recognise, in bringing this matter to the House, that the Government&#8217;s intentions were positive. However, when unintended consequences arise, it is our responsibility to evaluate them and, hopefully, to work together to deliver a fairer outcome for our constituents.</p>

	<p pid="c.401.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40165" name="Toby Perkins">the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins)</phrase> on securing this debate. It is a complicated subject and he explained it very well. I am sympathetic to the issues that he raised. He will know that the Government greatly value the important work that is carried out by public sector workers and by those who were previously in the public sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/2">The hon. Gentleman discussed the effect of the annual allowance rules for tax-relieved pension savings. He will, of course, be aware that we live in difficult economic times and that few households in this country have not been affected in some way by the economic crash of 2008-09. As part of our deficit reduction plans, the Government had to make difficult decisions in 2010 and 2013 to restrict the cost of pensions tax relief by reducing the annual allowance from &#163;255,000 to &#163;50,000 from 2011-12 onwards and to &#163;40,000 from 2014-15 onwards. We put those restrictions in place to ensure that the cost of pensions tax relief remained affordable and sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/3">The hon. Gentleman raised a number of concerns about the way in which the annual allowance rules work for defined benefit pension schemes in the context of bridging pensions, which can affect individuals who are transferred from the public sector under TUPE. Although</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/4">I cannot comment on the particular circumstances that he raised, it might be helpful if I give some background to those rules.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/5">The annual allowance rules provide a limit on the amount of tax-advantaged pension savings that can be made for individuals each year in registered pension schemes. Savings in excess of the limit are subject to the annual allowance income tax charge. For individuals in defined contribution schemes, it is straightforward to determine the level of contributions paid into a scheme to be assessed against the annual allowance limit. However, the position is more complex for defined benefit schemes because individuals accrue a right to an amount of annual pension from a set pension age, and the level of contributions made by the individual and the employer does not reflect the increase in the value of the member&#8217;s pension rights. We therefore needed a method to calculate the deemed level of contributions to test against the annual allowance. That method would have to be actuarially equivalent to the amount required to fund a similar promise in a defined contribution scheme.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/6">Detailed consultations were held with the pensions sector before the rules were introduced in 2006, and in 2010, when the Government consulted on the reduction in the annual allowance. As a result of the consultations and with support from the pensions sector, the amount of defined benefit pension savings in a year, when measured against the annual allowance limit, is broadly equivalent to the increase in the capital value of a promised pension over that period.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/7">To achieve the method of valuing pension savings under defined benefit schemes, special rules were developed so that for each &#163;1 a year of pension that will be payable, the present capital value of that annual pension benefit is &#163;16. The use of the 16:1 factor to value defined benefit pensions promises was adopted from April 2011 when the annual allowance was reduced, following recommendations by the Government Actuary. Before that, the factor was 10:1. The rules are intended to strike a balance between providing a system that is reasonably simple for individuals to understand and for pension schemes and HMRC to administer, and meeting the Government&#8217;s fiscal objectives.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/8">The hon. Gentleman raised concerns about the treatment of bridging pensions under annual allowance rules. Tax relief is provided for pension savings under defined benefit schemes on the understanding that the funds are used to provide an income throughout retirement. To support that aim, scheme pensions must normally be payable for life, and must not decrease except in prescribed circumstances. One such circumstance is where a bridging pension is paid and the reduction occurs between age 60 and state pension age. A bridging pension is a temporary increase to a private pension. Typically, it is provided where individuals retire before reaching state pension age, and where the level of the bridging pension is broadly similar to the expected state pension. When the state pension starts to be paid, the bridging pension is reduced or comes to an end.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/9">Where the bridging pension is offered as a discretionary award, or is a benefit to which the individual becomes entitled only if they choose to retire early, the award of the additional pension may give rise to pension savings in excess of the annual allowance limit. That is because the temporary nature of the increase to an individual&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/10">pension is not recognised in the same way that increases to the pension&#8217;s capital value is calculated for annual allowance purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/11">The Government have considered whether special annual allowance provisions should apply for bridging pensions, and that can be found in our response to consultations on the reduction of the annual allowance limit from 2011-12. We recognise that the restriction of relief may create particular challenges for members of defined benefit schemes because of the way promised benefits in those schemes are valued, but we concluded that it would not be desirable to complicate the pensions tax regime by including special provisions for bridging pensions. Instead, we introduced special rules intended to mitigate &#8220;hard cases&#8221;. Those rules allow individuals to carry forward unused annual allowances from the three preceding tax years, and set them off against pension savings above the annual allowance limit in a single year, providing that the individual was a member of a registered pension scheme during those three years. They also allow individuals to meet annual allowance charges of more than &#163;2,000 from their pension scheme. That is known as the &#8220;scheme pays&#8221; facility.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/12">The hon. Gentleman raised concerns that when a bridging pension paid to an individual from one scheme comes to an end, future pension payments to that individual from that scheme are treated as unauthorised</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/13">payments and liable to tax at a rate of up to 55%. As I have set out, scheme pensions can reduce only in certain prescribed circumstances. Where they are reduced in any other circumstances, unauthorised payments will arise and be subject to certain tax charges. The legislation for that is clear, has applied since April 2006, and is set out in schedule 28 to the Finance Act 2004. Those rules support the aim for defined benefit schemes to provide an income throughout retirement while protecting against manipulation of the tax-free lump sum.</p>
	<p pid="c.401.0/14">This is not a simple area. Although annual allowance rules for defined benefit schemes may appear difficult to understand, they are a necessary part of meeting the Government&#8217;s fiscal and policy objectives of targeting tax relief effectively. The rules are intended, as far as possible, to provide a straightforward structure for individuals and schemes, but I recognise that there may be particular cases where the rules do not work as intended. I am grateful that the hon. Gentleman has raised these issues today; he should rest assured that they will be kept under review and that the specific cases he has discussed will be taken into account.</p>
