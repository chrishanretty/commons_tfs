	<p pid="a.633.2/1">It is with great sadness that I have to announce the sudden death of our colleague Jim Dobbin, Member of Parliament for Heywood and Middleton, while on a Council of Europe trip to Poland. Before being elected to the House in 1997, Jim worked as a microbiologist for 33 years. He was elected as a councillor to the metropolitan borough of Rochdale council in 1983, becoming group leader in 1994. Jim was an assiduous, independent-minded and principled parliamentarian who enjoyed respect on both sides of the House. He will be sadly missed. We send our condolences to Jim&#8217;s wife of 50 years, Pat, and their four children: Patrick, Barry, Mary and Kerry.</p>

	<p pid="a.634.1/2">The Minister has made positive comments during her visits to fire stations throughout the country. The Government commissioned the Williams review on the impact of medical retirements for firefighters aged between 50 and 60, and especially the impact on women. Do the Government accept the need for minimum fitness standards?</p>

	<p pid="a.634.2/1">There need to be minimum fitness standards. That is a priority for me, and it is key to bringing the dispute to an end, so we need to consider carefully how firefighters who wish to maintain operational roles can be appropriately supported to maintain their fitness standards. I have asked the chief fire and rescue adviser to chair a working group to examine these issues in detail, and I expect that group to meet later this month. I also requested, and have had, a meeting with the FBU women&#8217;s committee regarding its concerns about fitness.</p>

	<p pid="a.634.3/1">As the number of fires has gone down, firefighters&#8217; roles have changed. For example, Cheshire fire and rescue works with the Prince&#8217;s Trust to support young people into work, and it is fitting fire alarms in old people&#8217;s homes and working to reduce antisocial behaviour. Is it not right that as the role of firefighters expands, we look at their terms and conditions to ensure that there are the right skills in fire services so that they can move forward?</p>

	<p pid="a.634.4/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Some of the best ideas for developing roles in the fire service have come from firefighters themselves, and they are at the head of the queue of people who want to remove the obstacles to change and reform. I am pleased that the review has already received a very large number of replies to the consultation, and some great ideas have emerged from that.</p>

	<p pid="a.634.5/1">I welcome the Minister to her position. I hope that she will bring a bit of common sense and rationality to this long dispute over pensions, but does she not agree that morale is very low among all those working in fire and rescue services across the country, not just because of pensions, but because of the age issue that has already been mentioned and the reductions in numbers in front-line fire services? We have to recognise that there is support for these men and women across the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.634.6/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her warm welcome. I take issue with her claim that morale is low. I have made going out and seeing firefighters and chiefs a priority in the short time I have been in office&#8212;in fact, just this weekend, I was up with the west midlands service. I asked them about morale and was told that</p>
	<p pid="a.634.6/2">morale is good. Clearly, everyone will benefit from the dispute being brought to a close, but actually morale is good and we need to keep it good, to keep firefighters engaged with the reforms the service needs.</p>

	<p pid="a.635.0/1">I welcome the Minister to her place and thank her for visiting my constituency on Saturday. We had what I think were constructive discussions with local firefighters, as well as celebrating the launch of the Haden Cross community fire station. Does she agree that the new fire station is a splendid example of a station that will serve the people of Halesowen and Rowley Regis and allow firefighters to do an effective job for my community?</p>

	<p pid="a.635.1/1">I was pleased to be part of that wonderful community event. It is a fantastic new facility, not just supplying state-of-the-art services to the fire and rescue services and as a base for other blue light services, but available for use by the local community as well. I had a wonderful day and I look forward very much to going back and doing more with that fire service.</p>

	<p pid="a.635.2/2">I too welcome the Minister to her post. The Government&#8217;s dispute with firefighters has now been ongoing for 1,091 days and there have been 31 strikes. Can she explain why her predecessor and colleague failed to bring the dispute to an end and what she will now do differently?</p>

	<p pid="a.635.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his words of welcome. Resolving the dispute is a key priority for the Government. I have some advantages that my predecessor did not have: when he entered office, we did not have the Williams report, the Knight review and other such reports that enable me and others to make evidence-based judgments. Everyone wants the dispute to be resolved. We are now in a position to have constructive talks, and we have been doing so with the FBU; and we have further meetings in the diary&#8212;we meet next after the trades union conference. I am optimistic that the dispute will be resolved soon.</p>

However, affordable housing starts in 2013-14 show an increase on the previous year, with a large percentage of them being in London. I remind him of what I said a few moments ago: under this Government average rents are down in real terms year on year, not just elsewhere in England but in London. It has been clear from the suggestions by Labour Members that the idea of short-term gimmicks such as rent controls are simply something from the past.</p>

	<p pid="a.648.3/2">The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has made it plain, both in letters to local authorities and by withdrawing the subsidy, that large and industrial-scale solar farms like those discussed earlier are simply not acceptable on greenfield agricultural sites. However, planning regulations do not so far reflect the robustness of the Department of Energy and Climate Change&#8217;s determination.

	<p pid="a.648.4/1">The short answer is yes. I was struck by what Members said, and this country clearly needs a robust and sustainable housing policy with regard to energy. We need a degree of reality and reasonableness in this approach. We have made a number of ministerial statements on the matter. It is excellent to see these solar panels on the roofs of houses, but we do not want them taking away valuable agricultural land. I shall look carefully at what my hon. Friends and Opposition Members have said, and we will work with fellow ministries and produce a statement soon.</p>

	<p pid="a.649.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman will readily understand that when we came to office, the Prevent strategy was moved to the Home Office. We have concentrated on the matters that bring people together and encourage communities not to be isolated. We have spent the best part of &#163;45 million on that endeavour, on things ranging from &#8220;English First&#8221;, which ensures English is taught in perhaps unusual places&#8212;trying to target young mothers, for example&#8212;to putting a lot of money, about &#163;10 million, into the recruitment of detached youth workers to appropriate organisations. We have also funded groups that work together, whether it be in mosques, churches or synagogues. The right hon. Gentleman is quite right to say that we all have an obligation in this regard. Speaking as someone brought up in a multicultural city, I think this issue goes far deeper than funding streams. It is an extraordinary sight to see someone born and brought up in this country participating in atrocities in the middle east. I pledge the Government, along with the Opposition, to work hard on this&#8212;</p>

Given what he said, however, why does he think that last month the widely respected counter-extremism think-tank Quilliam criticised his Department&#8217;s failure to produce a proper strategy as &#8220;catastrophic&#8221;? Does the right hon. Gentleman accept that much more needs to be done across government and the country to protect our young people, including confronting head-on Islamic State&#8217;s repugnant ideology, its promoters and apologists here in the United Kingdom and its utter contempt for our democracy and way of life?

	<p pid="a.653.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the NATO conference, but before I do so, I am sure the whole House will join me in paying tribute to Jim Dobbin, who died suddenly this weekend. Jim gave his life to public service. He worked hard for his constituents, he loved this House of Commons and he contributed hugely to all its work. With his expertise in microbiology, he also did outstanding work in this House championing vaccines for children in the developing world. Though we may not have agreed on everything, we did agree about the important contribution of faith in politics&#8212;although, unlike Jim, I have to say I am not expecting to get a knighthood from the Pope, which Jim received, and much deserved it was, too. He will be missed by us all, and our thoughts are with his family at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/2">We have also heard this morning that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their second baby. I am sure the House will join me in congratulating them on behalf of the whole country on this fantastic news and wishing them well in the months ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/3">The NATO summit in Wales saw the successful coming together of this vital alliance. Everyone could see its unity, its resolve and its determination to meet and overcome all the threats to our security. I want to thank the local council in Newport, the Welsh Assembly, the First Minister, the Secretary of State, our armed services and police and all those who worked so hard to deliver a safe, secure and successful summit. It was, I think, the biggest gathering of world leaders that has ever taken place in our country. Most of all, I want to thank the Welsh people for their incredibly warm welcome. They did our United Kingdom proud.</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/4">The summit reached important conclusions on Ukraine, on defence spending and the reform of NATO, on countering Islamist extremism, on the future of Afghanistan and on supporting our military and their families. I want briefly to take each one in turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/5">First, on Ukraine, we welcome the ceasefire that has been in place since Friday. At the NATO summit, I chaired a meeting with President Poroshenko and the leaders of France, Italy, Germany and America to agree that what was needed was the implementation of a proper peace plan that respected Ukraine&#8217;s territorial integrity. NATO sent a clear message to Russia that what President Putin was doing was illegal and indefensible. We stand firmly behind Ukraine&#8217;s right to make its own decisions and not to have them dictated by Russian soldiers trampling on Ukraine&#8217;s sovereign soil.</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/6">We will continue our efforts to support Ukraine, including by providing financial assistance to improve its command, control and communication capabilities. Today&#8217;s new sanctions from the European Union will further ramp up the economic cost to Russia. They will make it harder for its banks and its energy and defence companies to borrow money. They will widen the ban on selling so-called dual goods, such as machinery and computer equipment, which could be used for military as well as civilian purposes. They will also prohibit the provision of services for the exploration and production of shale, deepwater and Arctic oil.</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/7">Secondly, the summit reached an important agreement on defence spending. One of the problems with NATO is that only a small number of countries have achieved the commitment to spend 2% of their GDP on defence. As a result, the share of spending by the largest country, the United States of America, continues remorselessly upwards and now accounts for around 70% of the total. That is not sustainable. The summit addressed that by agreeing the responsibility of those countries that have not achieved 2%. The conclusions were very clear about that. Through the Wales pledge, every NATO member spending less than 2% has now agreed to halt any decline in defence spending, to aim to increase it in real terms as GDP grows and to move towards 2% within a decade.</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/8">There was also a second target&#8212;namely, that a fifth of all defence budgets should be dedicated to major new equipment, because what matters most is having military assets that we can actually deploy. Here in Britain, we have the second largest defence budget in NATO and the biggest in the European Union. We have taken long-term and often difficult decisions to put our defence budget on a sustainable footing, and the fruits of that are now coming through.</p>
	<p pid="a.653.1/9">We are equipping all three of our services with the best and most modern military hardware that money can buy. This includes a &#163;3.5 billion contract for Scout armoured vehicles, which I announced on Friday&#8212;the largest such order in over three decades. <i>[Interruption.] </i>It includes new fleets of joint strike fighter and Voyager refuelling aircraft; 22 new A400M transport aircraft; new Astute hunter-killer submarines; Type 45 destroyers and Type 26 frigates; and HMS Queen Elizabeth, our brand new aircraft carrier&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.654.3/1">It is all very well to order them, but they actually have to be paid for. In a nutshell, that is the difference between a socialist and a Conservative. They dream about having money; we actually raise it and spend it.</p>
	<p pid="a.654.3/2">The hon. Gentleman will be very pleased to hear that I announced at the NATO summit that that our second new carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, will also be brought into service. This will ensure that we always have one carrier available 100% of the time. This investment in our national security, our prosperity and our place in the world will transform our ability to project power globally, whether independently or together with our allies.</p>
	<p pid="a.654.3/3">Turning to the wider reform of NATO, after the end of the cold war, NATO stood down its highest readiness force. At this summit, we decided to reverse that decision and scale up our readiness to respond to any threat. At the same time, we agreed to do more to build the capacity of other nations outside NATO, to help them with their defence capabilities. A new multinational spearhead force will be formed, and it will be deployable</p>
	<p pid="a.654.3/4">anywhere in the world within two to five days. That is vital in underlining our article 5 obligations to collective defence, and the UK will support that by providing a battle group and a brigade headquarters. We will also contribute 3,500 personnel to exercises in eastern Europe between now and the end of 2015, as part of NATO&#8217;s efforts to ensure a persistent presence on our eastern flank.</p>
	<p pid="a.654.3/5">On capacity building, NATO has a vital role in helping other countries with their capacity to defend themselves against all threats, including terrorist threats. When we consider how many of the threats that NATO countries, including the UK, now face from the middle east, north Africa and elsewhere, we see that this capacity building is becoming ever more important. It was a key priority for the UK at the summit that we made progress. NATO will now undertake capacity building missions, beginning in Georgia and Jordan, with the offer of a training mission for Iraq as soon as the new Iraqi Government are in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.654.3/6">Next, the alliance was clear about the scale of the threat from Islamist extremism, and we agreed that we must use all the instruments at our disposal&#8212;humanitarian, diplomatic and military&#8212;to squeeze this barbaric terrorist organisation out of existence. We should be clear about what needs to happen: we will continue to support the Kurds, including by providing them with arms and training their troops; we will work to support a new and representative Iraqi Government, which we hope to see in place later this week; and the fight against ISIL must be led by the Iraqis themselves, but we will continue to encourage countries in the region to support this effort and to engage allies across the world. We will proceed carefully and methodically, drawing together the partners we need, to implement a comprehensive plan. Earlier today, I spoke to Ban Ki-moon to seek support at the United Nations for a broad-based international effort to confront ISIL, and I will be working on building that international support when I attend the United Nations General Assembly later this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.654.3/7">Turning to Afghanistan, we called on the two presidential candidates to work together to deliver a peaceful election outcome and a new Government as swiftly as possible. They made a statement during the conference that they would make those endeavours, and it is vital that that comes about. The summit paid tribute to the extraordinary sacrifice made by all our armed forces in driving al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan and training the Afghan security forces to take control of their security. We reaffirmed our long-term commitment to supporting a peaceful, prosperous and stable Afghanistan, including through our development conference in London in November.</p>
	<p pid="a.654.3/8">Finally, as our troops return home from Afghanistan, it is right that we do all we can to support them and their families. In Britain, we have the military covenant&#8212;a pledge of commitment between the Government and our military&#8212;and we are the first British Government to write this covenant into the law of the land. We have made it ever more real by taking a series of measures, including: doubling the operational allowance; introducing free higher and further education scholarships; investing &#163;200 million in helping our service personnel to buy homes; increasing the rate of council tax relief; signing</p>
	<p pid="a.654.3/9">up every single local council in our country in support of the military; and giving unprecedented support to military charities.</p>
	<p pid="a.654.3/10">At the summit, we took our military covenant internationally, with every NATO member signing up to a new armed forces declaration, setting out their commitment to support their military and enabling all of us to learn from each other about how we can best do that. We will continue to do everything possible to look after those who serve our country and whose sacrifices keep us safe. This, I believe, was a successful NATO conference. It proved that this organisation is as important to our future security as it has been to the past, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.656.0/1">First, I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to Jim Dobbin. He was an assiduous Member of Parliament who always put the people of Heywood and Middleton first. He was, as the Prime Minister said, a man of faith, which underpinned everything he did, and he was a lifelong public servant, having worked in the NHS for 30 years before coming to this House. He was also a proud Scot, and was planning to be in Scotland this week to help campaign to keep our United Kingdom together. He will be sadly missed, not just by his family and friends, but by colleagues from across this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/2">I also join the Prime Minister in congratulating the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their happy news, and I, too, wish them well in the months ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/3">I congratulate Wales on its successful hosting of the summit. Perhaps we should also congratulate the enterprising Raffle family on their picture at Stonehenge with President Obama.</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/4">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement. This NATO summit was the most important for a generation. Today, NATO faces the gravest challenges in Europe, the middle east and beyond since the fall of the Berlin wall and the first Gulf war. I commend NATO leaders for seizing the opportunity to put down firm markers on the key issues: Russia and Ukraine, ISIL, and defence co-operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/5">Starting with Ukraine, the ceasefire and peace plan announced on Friday by the Presidents of Ukraine and Russia was welcome, but it must be observed. It would be a grave mistake to ease international pressure on Russia before Russian troops no longer operate in Ukraine. We therefore welcome the readiness action plan, which is a step towards more nimble and flexible capabilities, sending a signal that if a NATO member is in danger, allies will take quick action. I welcome the attendance of President Poroshenko at the summit. What assurances were specifically given to Ukraine by NATO? Given also the desired aim of agility in the plan, how is the NATO decision-making process requiring agreement of all 28 countries being made sufficiently reliable and swift? Specifically, on the spearhead force, what countries will be host to it and in what situations will it be deployed?</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/6">Let me move on to the rise of ISIL in the middle east. The whole world is acutely aware of the barbaric threat that ISIL poses, and it was right that NATO members sought to address that. It is right also to seek to build the widest possible consensus in pursuit of that aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/7">There is no long-term solution to ISIL without a long-term plan that is based on widespread partnership in the region and the legitimacy of an inclusive Iraqi Government, and that includes a genuinely multilateral, political, diplomatic and humanitarian alliance.</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/8">In that context, will the Prime Minister tell us what progress is being made in the urgent task of assembling a genuine inclusive Government in Iraq? I welcome the united position taken by the Arab League yesterday against ISIL. Will the Prime Minister update the House on what other progress has been made in the vital work of building regional support?</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/9">Let me turn to NATO&#8217;s clarity of purpose, which is the collective defence of a strong transatlantic alliance. On defence spending, we share the commitment to maintain strong defence and a strong NATO. In the light of the pressures that all countries face, does the Prime Minister agree that part of the task that NATO faces is better pooling of alliance resources so that we have the kinds of capabilities that are required?</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/10">Finally, on Afghanistan, I commend the commitment of NATO members to Afghanistan. Our country has made huge sacrifices, and so have a number of others. It is right that by the end of 2014 we will see the drawdown of British forces. I pay tribute to our forces for the sacrifices that they have made and I join the Prime Minister in giving my full support to the military covenant, the armed forces declaration and its implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/11">We know from the past, not least in Iraq, the crucial importance of securing the right political settlement. To ensure that the sacrifices that have been made lead to a better future, Afghan leaders must resolve their current post-election differences and agree to a unified leadership. Will the Prime Minister update the House on progress on that matter and on a security agreement with the remaining forces? Given that the force contribution from coalition nations will be critical, will the Prime Minister tell the House the number of NATO troops expected to stay past 2014 and the UK contribution to that mission?</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/12">This summit has demonstrated that the NATO alliance is strong and is needed by its member states more than ever. As President Obama said:</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/13">&#8220;The defence of Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius is just as important as the defence of Berlin and Paris and London.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.656.0/14">The task for NATO is to demonstrate this commitment and to understand that wherever our interests lie, we need a strategy that combines military readiness with political, diplomatic and strategic alliances. We join the Government in supporting a NATO that meets that challenge.</p>

	<p pid="a.657.0/1">I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his response. He was right to say that this was the most important NATO conference for a generation. That is because we face multiple challenges&#8212;in Europe and Ukraine, with ISIL and the other threats around our very dangerous world. Let me take his questions in turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.657.0/2">On Ukraine, the mood of the NATO meeting and the meeting I chaired with the Ukrainian President was that there should be no easing of the pressure on Russia. With regard to what NATO is doing for Ukraine, there is some important defence capability building being done on things such as command and control and</p>
	<p pid="a.657.0/3">ensuring that the Ukrainian army is properly managed. There is also support in the form of non-lethal equipment such as body armour and other facilities that countries are giving. It is important that we do not measure the NATO commitment to Ukraine through military support for war-fighting capabilities. The real measure of support is the EU and US approach on sanctions, which have been ratcheted up. As I have said in the House before, it is important that we keep up the pressure in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.657.0/4">As for the new spearhead force, different countries will be contributing and Britain has got out ahead by making clear the nature of our commitment through the brigade headquarters and the battalion. I am sure that others will come forward with their contributions, but the right hon. Gentleman is right that the implementation of the NATO agenda will now be vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.657.0/5">On the question of combating ISIL, I agree absolutely with what the right hon. Gentleman says about the need for an inclusive Government in Iraq. That is supposed to be being put in place this week. It has already taken time and it is a complex undertaking, but it is absolutely vital. I would argue that without that, it is very difficult to take the further steps that need to be taken, so it is vital that it is put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.657.0/6">The right hon. Gentleman asked about regional support. Jordan, as a partner nation of NATO, was at the conference and made a very strong statement about its support for squeezing ISIL. He asked whether NATO countries are properly pooling their resources, and this is where the 20% pledge on new equipment is so vital. When new equipment is commissioned, it should be properly interoperable between NATO countries, and increasingly it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.657.0/7">On Afghanistan, the right hon. Gentleman is right to say that the way to secure our legacy in Afghanistan is to ensure that there is a proper political settlement. A lot of pressure is being put on Dr Abdullah Abdullah and Dr Ghani to bury their differences and form a Government together. They have promised to do that, but we need to see it happen. The right hon. Gentleman asked about the contribution that Britain will make to the NATO forces. Our principal contribution post the end of 2014 will be the officer training academy that President Karzai specifically asked for and that we are providing. That should put our contribution of troops for that facility into the low hundreds. Some other countries, most notably the United States but also Germany and some others, will have more NATO troops on the ground, as it were.</p>
	<p pid="a.657.0/8">The right hon. Gentleman asked about the bilateral security agreement; both candidates have said that they will sign it, and I would expect it to be signed. As for his general point, what is required in Afghanistan, as in Iraq, is a combination of all the assets we have at our disposal. On occasion, that will include military assets, but the importance of politics cannot be underestimated. The future of Afghanistan will best be secured by an inclusive Afghan Government and the future of Iraq will best be delivered if there is an inclusive Iraqi Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.659.0/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for his remarks and I can absolutely give him that assurance. It was important that one of the first things that needed to happen at the conference was for NATO to be very clear about the article 5 commitment that all members of NATO are subject to collective defence, Estonia included. It is important that that message goes out and that we should not only have the readiness action plan and the new spearhead force but start to see more NATO exercises, so that when Russians look at Estonia&#8212;or Latvia or Lithuania&#8212;they see different nationalities involved in their defence, not just Estonians.

	<p pid="a.659.3/2">The attempt to obtain a 2% level of expenditure within 10 years can be regarded only as a rather gentle target, so is my right hon. Friend satisfied that it is strong enough?

	<p pid="a.660.0/1">I agree very much with what my right hon. and learned Friend says about Jim Dobbin. As a passionate Scot, a passionate Brit and a passionate Labour MP, he showed that you can be all three of those things, and we could replace the word &#8220;Labour&#8221; with &#8220;Conservative&#8221; or &#8220;Liberal Democrat&#8221; and say absolutely the same thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.660.0/2">What is different about this time is that the 2% spending pledge has never before been included in a leaders&#8217; declaration in quite the same way, and there has never been a time scale for it. I particularly pick out that it puts in its sights those who are below 2%, saying that they need to halt any further decline in their defence spending. I think that is a powerful statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.660.0/3">On ISIL, of course one has to degrade an ideology. However, when it comes to terrorists who have taken control of a state&#8217;s institutions, meaning that they have land, oil, money and weapons, we should be more ambitious and say that the right people to run the state of Iraq are the Iraqi Government and the right people to run Syria are an inclusive Syrian Government, and that there should be no place in those states for these extreme terrorists.</p>

One only has to think for a few moments of what it would be like to be in his or his family&#8217;s position to understand what they are going through. What I try to make sure of in all these situations is that the family gets support from a police liaison officer and directly from the Foreign Office. There is always an offer for Ministers to speak directly to the hostage&#8217;s family to tell them about all the efforts being made on their behalf. We have a clear policy, which I believe is right, not to pay ransoms when terrorist kidnaps are involved. I made that point at the NATO dinner and pleaded with other countries to do the same, but no one should interpret that as our not doing everything we can in every case to help the family and the hostage.</p>

There were none of the sort of debates that might have been had in previous discussions about Iraq. There was real unity about what needed to be done, and part of that unity was not just about the Iraqi Government that was required, but the support&#8212;the active support&#8212;that would be needed from the regional players, in particular Sunni countries that can provide not only resources, diplomacy, aid and even military support, but real insights and input into the thinking of the Sunni tribes in Iraq, whom we need to rise up against this appalling regime.</p>

The vision I believe in, and I believe the majority of Scots believe in, is, yes, of a proud and strong Scotland with strong institutions and a powerful place in the world that is in part secured by its membership of the United Kingdom. The alternative vision of separation involves such uncertainty about all these organisations&#8212;not knowing whether they would have a place in the European Union, or indeed a place in NATO, or indeed what currency they would use. These are real problems of uncertainty. I believe that the patriotic choice for Scotland is a strong, proud Scotland but within the United Kingdom.</p>

We are already helping the Kurds, delivering arms to them. I said that we should step up to arming them directly and to training Kurdish peshmerga battalions, and increasing all the elements of the strategy. I have always believed, in this role and as leader of a Government, that you should consult the House of Commons as regularly as you can and the House of Commons should have an opportunity to vote. The point I always make, though, and this is not to run away from the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s particular scenario in any way, is that it is important that a Prime Minister and a Government reserve the right to act swiftly without consulting the Commons in advance in some specific circumstances&#8212;for instance, if we had to prevent an immediate humanitarian catastrophe or, indeed, secure a really important, unique British interest. But other than that I believe it is right, as he said, to consult the House of Commons.</p>

The convention that has grown up&#8212;it is now clear that the House of Commons should be consulted and a vote taken&#8212;is now very clearly understood on both sides of the House, and my personal view is that that might be better than trying to write everything down in some inflexible document that can create all sorts of legal problems of its own.</p>

The Welsh Assembly Government, the Secretary of State, the police and all the organisations, including Newport council, which I singled out, did a brilliant job, and Celtic Manor was an absolutely excellent venue. Something like 24,000 hotel room nights were required, not just in Wales, but on the other side of the Bristol channel. Wales must make sure we secure the legacy from the summit, and that can be seen in trade and investment. It was a great window on Wales. I also think there is a legacy in making sure that young people in our country understand the importance of NATO and of defence.</p>

I agree with what he said about the importance of the issue of addiction to prescription drugs, but above all I think Newport really did put a great face forward in how it responded, because there are pressures with a NATO summit: there are traffic problems and disruption, but I thought people were incredibly reasonable about that and very welcoming, including the local media, to everyone who came. Securing the legacy is about supporting the investment conference and making sure we maintain a pro-business environment in south Wales.</p>

	<p pid="a.665.1/1">The growing parliamentary convention, which the Prime Minister mentioned a moment ago, that this House should be consulted and given a vote on all overseas deployments would fail for two reasons in this context. The first, of course, is that the NATO rapid reaction force he has described would be deployed within two days, so presumably there would be no possibility of any such vote&#8212;perhaps there should not be one anyhow. It would also be deployed under NATO command. Secondly, the House has voted on war on only two occasions&#8212;one was Iraq in 2003 and the second was Syria last year&#8212;and neither of them was an outstanding success. Does the Prime Minister agree that serious thought ought now to be given to precisely what role this House should have when we decide to deploy our troops overseas?</p>

	<p pid="a.665.2/1">I hear what my hon. Friend says, but I would say that the convention that has grown up is that if a premeditated decision is made by the Government about action to be undertaken&#8212;whether the war in Iraq, or my view that it was right to consider action in response to the use of chemical weapons in Syria&#8212;it is right to consult and, if possible, to have a vote in the House of Commons. I do not think that we need to write that down in some book of rules for it to be the overwhelming convention. But as I have said, there are times where very rapid decisions have to be taken, and I think that the House of Commons understands that when that happens, as was the case with Libya, you make the decision and come straight to the House to explain yourself afterwards.</p>

	<p pid="a.666.0/1">The short answer to that is yes. Up to now, we have helped to provide the Kurds with weapons. We have transported some weapons, for instance from Albania to the Kurds, using our transport planes, because that fitted in with the weaponry they have been using, some of which is from the Soviet era. However, I have always said that we would respond positively to requests from the Kurds for a direct supply. We are now prepared to do that, so we will provide them with arms, as the Germans and others will. We think it is right, also with allies, to step up our training and mentoring efforts. We have said that we were willing, if they would like, to train a battalion of peshmerga fighters, because they are doing such a vital job in holding back ISIL.

	<p pid="a.666.2/1">The short answer to that is that, no, I do not think that it would be right to reconsider the reforms. Over the last year, 3,200 people joined the Army Reserve&#8212;I am confident that we will now see some good recruitment figures to the Army Reserve&#8212;but we are putting in place a major change.</p>
	<p pid="a.666.2/2">The bigger point that I would make to my hon.

That resonated very strongly with me as an islander, and with my desire to remain British. I also associate myself with the Prime Minister&#8217;s comment that he is not expecting any knighthood from the Pope&#8212;he&#8217;s not the only one in this House in that particular regard.</p>

I hope that some progress can be made on that. In the meantime, local councils can of course take up the community covenant to make sure that they act in a way that supports the armed forces and their families. Many councils in Northern Ireland will be able to do that. As for the hon.

	<p pid="a.667.2/1">I think that the aim of Russia is to deny the people of Ukraine their legitimate choice to be closer to the European Union and to have an association agreement with it. We need to say very reasonably to President Putin that he cannot overcome the stated will of a people to determine their own future. Of course there should be a relationship between Ukraine and Russia, and indeed between the European Union and Russia, but he cannot use force to stop people choosing their own future. That is why we should measure our response to Russian action not in a military response through NATO or Ukraine, but in raising the pressure through sanctions. We should say to Russia that if she continues down that path, she will suffer economically, because ultimately, as I have said from this Dispatch Box before, Russia needs America and the European Union more than America and the European Union need Russia.</p>

We are giving him our support by saying that we will do everything that we can to engage with Russia to ensure that it engages properly in the peace process.

	<p pid="a.668.3/1">The absence of any of Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran from a commitment to or the formation of an international strategy to destroy the Islamic State, will probably fatally compromise such a strategy. What efforts are being made to include them?</p>

	<p pid="a.668.4/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point, and the Turkish President, with whom I had quite extensive talks at the NATO conference, is, like everyone else, extremely worried about the creation of that state on his doorstep, not least because of the appalling kidnaps that have taken place of such a large number of Turkish personnel. My hon. Friend is right that discussions must be held with all those regional partners and players to ensure that the strongest possible squeeze can be put on that organisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.669.0/1">The west went into Afghanistan 13 years ago, Iraq 11 years ago, and now a massive NATO summit agrees to spend yet more money on defence around the world. What consideration was given to why there has been such an increase in terrorism since those two wars, and to why ISIL has grown as such a big force? Should the NATO summit, and indeed all leaders, be looking at the causes of war, and at the perception of the role of the west in seeking commercial and mineral advantage around the world, rather than bequeathing us yet more military expenditure?</p>

	<p pid="a.669.1/1">Let me try to find a little common ground with the hon. Gentleman. As well as believing in the importance of defence expenditure and keeping our defences strong, I also believe that international aid and development is an important tool not just for helping people out of poverty, but in demonstrating the compassion and generosity of the west in helping people who are less fortunate than we are. Where I think the hon. Gentleman is wrong is that we have to understand that a fundamental cause of the extremism and terrorism that we saw with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, and that we see with ISIL in Syria and Iraq, is the poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism. We see people joining it who have not suffered poverty or deprivation, but they have bought into that perverted world view. Irrespective of what we might think of them, they are very clear that they want to kill us.</p>

Yes, it is important that we have those conversations.</p>

He is also right to draw attention to the role of religious leaders and religious communities. It has been heartening to see how many Muslim and Islamic leaders have come out to condemn ISIL and to say that those people are not in any way acting in their name. They have even gone viral burning the ISIL flag. It is thoroughly worth while for people right across different religious communities to condemn ISIL.</p>

	<p pid="a.670.3/1">The hon. Lady makes a spot-on point. We have good relations with, for instance, the Saudi military, the Qataris, the Emirates and the Jordanians, partly because many have trained here alongside our armed forces. We should maximise those relationships and that defence engagement. That should be part of the comprehensive plan that has been put in place&#8212;we should work with them to squeeze ISIL. One thing we decided at NATO was that we need to do even more to build the capability of those militaries because, increasingly in our dangerous world, we are confronting problems, whether in Syria, Mali or Somalia, where it would be good if the regional players had the military capabilities better to deal with the problems&#8212;with our assistance and help, but not always with our direct interaction.</p>

We can think of the magnificent service of the Scottish regiments and the expertise of those who have built our incredible warships in Scotland&#8212;most recently, of course, the aircraft carriers. It is the contribution of all parts of the United Kingdom that means we have a defence budget that is one of the top five in the world and armed forces that are the envy of the world.

	<p pid="a.673.2/1">We have always been told that the more we spend on overseas aid, the more it will enhance our security. We have been spending more on overseas aid, but the security threat level has been raised, so that correlation has clearly been shown to be a load of old cobblers. Will the Prime Minister therefore divert some of the money from the overseas aid budget and give much needed additional resources to our armed forces and security services to help keep us safe in these very dangerous times?</p>

	<p pid="a.673.3/1">I do not think it is quite right to make that correlation. I would argue that had we not put money into stabilising Somalia, for instance, or Afghanistan or into helping save lives in countries such as Pakistan, we would have seen even more pressures from asylum seeking and migration, and even greater problems with drugs and terrorism. What we have to get right is the balance between armed forces to keep us strong and an aid budget that fulfils our moral responsibility to the poorest in the world, which also helps, I would argue, to keep us safe.</p>

It was good to see the Gloucestershire constabulary in RAF Fairford playing a small role in the logistics, and I welcome the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement. As part of the security discussions, did members discuss the role of foreign imams in our mosques? UK-born and educated imams preach in the context of understanding Britain and are valued, but that is not always the case with foreign imams. Does my right hon.

	<p pid="a.674.4/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his question. There are various elements to this. First, the fact that there will be a defence capability-building mission in Georgia is very significant; it will help the Georgians modernise and build up their armed forces. It is also worth noting that a lot of this is being done because of the real contribution that Georgia has made, not least to the ISAF forces in Afghanistan, where the Georgians took on some very difficult work and paid a high price in terms of casualties. This is an enhanced partnership. Georgia is one of the strongest partners that NATO has, and I am sure that this defence capability mission will be much welcomed.</p>

	<p pid="a.674.5/1">I think it reasonable to regard the defence budget of our country as an insurance policy for its security, and to regard NATO as a group insurance policy. However, it is clear that while all NATO members wish to enjoy the security that the cover of membership gives them, not all of them wish to pay the premiums. Does my right hon.

	<p pid="a.675.0/1">My hon. Friend puts it in a good way. In order to enjoy the collective security, we must pay into the insurance policy, but the Germans tend not to sign things unless they have read the small print. They are quite meticulous. I know that Chancellor Merkel looked very carefully at what the agreement said before she signed it. I think that that is important, because Germany&#8217;s defence expenditure is below 2%, and it must therefore halt any decline in that expenditure.</p>

There is a real problem with Europe&#8217;s external borders&#8212;the Greek border being one&#8212;where people are coming into Europe to claim asylum, but instead of claiming asylum in the first country they arrive in, which is what they ought to do, they are making their way to Calais in order to try and come to the UK.

	<p pid="a.676.4/1">I will try to be careful and methodical about everything I do, but the point I would make, even today, to the British people is: be in no doubt about the threat that the so-called Islamic State poses to us here in the United Kingdom. We have already seen something like six planned attacks by ISIL in the countries of the European Union, including of course the appalling attack in the Brussels Jewish museum where innocent people were killed. That flows directly from this organisation. It kidnaps people, it has ransom</p>
	<p pid="a.676.4/2">payments&#8212;it has made tens of millions of dollars in that way&#8212;and it now has the weapons, resources and oil of a state and is using some of that money directly to target people in this country and across the European Union. We have to be fully cognisant of that fact. There is no option to look away, to put our head in the sand, to hope this will all go away if only we did not get involved. The fact is that we are involved because it has decided to target us, and that needs to be the beginning of the conversation we have.</p>

	<p pid="a.678.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. Over the weekend, my surgeries were picketed by an individual in dispute with the Courts Service. I recognise the right to protest, but the use of a loud-hailer made it almost impossible to hold a conversation with those visiting my surgeries. The protest also extended to my home and, more worryingly, those of my patient and generous neighbours, which resulted in multiple calls being made to the police throughout Saturday and Sunday. The protester made it clear to my neighbours that unless I succeeded, as their MP, in changing the law to his liking, he would mount a sustained campaign against them. These threats caused great distress. Protest is one thing, but it is intolerable to try to coerce an MP to act in a particular way under the threat of his neighbours and constituents being harassed, disrupted and distressed. To paraphrase a US President&#8212;I think it was Truman or Roosevelt&#8212;&#8220;Your right to throw a punch ends where the nose of another constituent begins.&#8221;</p>

Let me, perhaps&#8212;I hope on behalf of the House&#8212;make the situation clear beyond doubt: however strongly any individual feels about a particular cause or campaign, each and every Member of this House has a right to go about his or her legitimate business without intimidation or harassment, or fear thereof. Moreover, it is quite unacceptable for any individual to threaten continuing such harassment if the Member fails to seek to bring about the particular change in the law that that member of the public seeks.

I treasure a photo of him outside this building campaigning for the end of nuclear weapons in this country. However, something seems to be missing here. When a Member dies in office, tributes have to be paid through interventions in debates on completely different subjects or through a brief statement by you, Mr Speaker.

	<p pid="a.680.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point of order. I am very open to that proposition, although it would not be right for me to seek to impose a new arrangement. I have, however, sought to update and humanise the procedure. When I first took office, I was told that the proper practice was to report the fact of a death very baldly and rather coldly. When I suggested that I should perhaps utter a couple of sentences of tribute to the Member, I was told, &#8220;Oh no, Mr Speaker, that is not the way it is done. That is not appropriate.&#8221; I am afraid I decided that it was appropriate, and that we should move on and invest these matters with some humanity. I do not know whether there is a feeling in the House that we should have a short, dedicated session in such circumstances, but I have a feeling that the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point of order will quickly be brought to the attention of the Procedure Committee, whose Chair was here only a few moments ago. Let that conversation begin.

	<p pid="a.681.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">This is the third national insurance contributions&#8212;NICs&#8212;Bill this Parliament. The Government have already taken action to reduce significantly the burden of NICs on earnings and employment through previous Bills. At Budget 2011, the Chancellor announced a &#163;21 a week above-inflation increase to the employer&#8217;s NICs threshold. Last April, the employment allowance was introduced, which will benefit up to 1.25 million businesses and charities. Next April, the vast majority of under 21-year-olds in work will be lifted out of employer NICs, which will support 1.5 million jobs. All those measures have been strongly welcomed by business and have contributed to the current record levels of employment.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/3">This Bill contains four measures: simplifying NICs paid by the self-employed; accelerating the payment to the Exchequer of NICs in dispute in avoidance cases, and providing for the issue of follower notices where the scheme or arrangements have been shown to fail in another party&#8217;s litigation; applying new information powers and penalties to promoters of avoidance schemes; and introducing a targeted anti-avoidance rule&#8212;TAAR&#8212;to prevent people from circumventing new legislation tackling avoidance involving employment intermediaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/4">Let me explain each of those four measures in more detail, starting with the simplification of NICs paid by the self-employed, which is contained in clauses 1 and 2, and schedule 1. Hon. Members may recollect that at Budget 2014 the Chancellor announced that the Government intend to simplify the NICs collection process for the self-employed, who currently have to operate two different processes for two separate classes of NICs. This followed a 2012 recommendation by the Office of Tax Simplification and a consultation published in July 2013 entitled &#8220;Simplifying the National Insurance Processes for the Self Employed&#8221;, which sought views on proposals to simplify class 2 NICs.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/5">The number of self-employed individuals in the UK is growing, with more people having multiple jobs and moving in and out of self-employment. Having two separate collection methods for class 2 and class 4 NICs causes confusion and extra work for both the self-employed and Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. The objective behind the measure is to modernise the way class 2 NICs are assessed and collected, making the system simpler and more straightforward, and reducing administrative burdens on the self-employed. Class 2 NICs are currently collected via a flat-rate charge of &#163;2.75 per week, paid through six-monthly billing or by direct debit, while class 4 NICs are a percentage charge on profits&#8212;of 9% between the lower and upper profits limit and 2% above the upper profits limit&#8212;paid through self-assessment alongside income tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/6">The aims of clauses 1 and 2, and schedule 1 are to: change the way in which class 2 NICs are structured; change the means by which class 2 NICs are collected, by moving their collection into self-assessment, so that they can be collected alongside class 4 NICs and income tax; change the means by which class 2 NICs are</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/7">enforced, with changes to associated appeal rights to mirror broadly those for class 4 NICs and income tax; and make consequential changes to legislation relating to maternity allowance to allow women to continue to become eligible for it post-reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/8">Those changes are proposed to take effect for the 2015-16 tax year onwards, so that the collection of class 2 NICs under self-assessment will be from <phrase class="date" code="2016-04-06">6 April 2016</phrase>. The changes are aimed at simplifying NICs for the self- employed and small businesses&#8212;sole traders, partnerships and unincorporated businesses&#8212;by enabling them to report their class 2 NICs liability and pay it through their self-assessment, thus reducing the administrative burden of the two current separate collection mechanisms. The six-monthly billing and direct debit systems will cease from April 2015 and July 2015 respectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/9">During the consultation there was some concern that the reform would mean that the self-employed would no longer be able to spread the cost of paying class 2 NICs. I want to take this opportunity to reassure the self-employed that there is already the facility in self-assessment to make budget payments to spread the cost of tax and NICs through the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/10">Hon. Members may be interested to know that one of the key changes that we made through this reform is that there will no longer be a need for customers with low profits who want to opt out of paying class 2 NICs to apply for a small earnings exception in advance&#8212;something that we know they find confusing and burdensome. Under this reform, customers with profits below the new small profits threshold, which will be equivalent to the current small earnings exception threshold, will not be liable to pay class 2 NICs, but will be able to choose to do so on a voluntary basis. That means that those with low profits who want to opt out of paying class 2 NICs will not need to do anything apart from confirm that when they are completing their self-assessment return, while those who still choose to pay in order to protect the benefits entitlement will be able to do so quickly and easily. Rather than a separate process, the decision will be built into the self-assessment return.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/11">There is a small proportion of HMRC customers who pay class 2 NICs but who are not in self-assessment. Those individuals will continue to get a separate class 2 NICs payment request. They will receive that once a year instead of twice a year as they currently do. Hon. Members will be pleased to learn that the tax information impact note published by HMRC about this measure indicates a net administrative burden reduction to the self-employed of &#163;74 million over five years as a result of these reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/12">I now wish to take the House through the provisions in the Bill that deal with accelerating the payment to the Exchequer of amounts of NICs in dispute in avoidance cases. That also includes providing for the issue of follower notices where there is a relevant case in which the scheme or arrangement has been shown to fail in another party&#8217;s litigation. Those provisions are in clauses 3 and 4 and schedule 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/13">The provisions broadly follow, for NICs, new powers that are included in the Finance Act 2014&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" name="Shabana Mahmood">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase> and I debated this matter not that long ago&#8212;which allow HMRC to issue a notice to taxpayers who have used avoidance schemes that have failed before the courts in another party&#8217;s litigations. The provisions in</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/14">the Bill and the Finance Act 2014 are estimated to raise &#163;5 billion in tax and NICs for the Exchequer in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/15">A follower notice sets out HMRC&#8217;s view that a judicial decision in another case is directly relevant and that those who receive the notice should settle their disputes. If the taxpayer does not settle in response to this notice, they will face a tax-geared penalty if they are unable to show that their case is materially different from the other party&#8217;s litigation or if they did not have reasonable grounds to continue the dispute.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/16">An accelerated payment may be required from taxpayers in the following circumstances: where a follower notice has been issued and the taxpayer decides not to settle their dispute; where taxpayers are involved in schemes subject to disclosure under the disclosure of tax avoidance schemes&#8212;DOTAS&#8212;rules: and where taxpayers have used arrangements that HMRC decides to counteract under the general anti-abuse rule.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/17">For both follower notices and accelerated payments, taxpayers will have 90 days to make representations. There is no formal right of appeal against the notices or payments, but taxpayers can appeal against any penalties. The measures are expected to lead to the issue of payment notices to around 43,000 taxpayers involved in avoidance schemes currently under dispute with HMRC over the period to the end of March 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/18">Now that I have outlined what the provisions in the Bill do, I want to address some of the points raised in debate on the Finance Bill and by some commentators. One point that has been made is that the measure effectively assumes that someone is guilty before they are proved innocent. The Government do not agree, as most people pay their tax up front and can apply for a refund afterwards, for example through pay-as-you-earn, VAT and tax on interest income, and the measure extends the existing practice of having disputed tax sit with the Exchequer. That is already the case when taxpayers seek tax refunds for disputed avoidance. The measure in no way alters the rights of appeal that people already have when disputing the tax or NICs they owe HMRC; it is only about where the money sits while the dispute continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/19">Hon. Members might also be aware that the measure has been described as having retrospective effect. The Government do not agree. It is not retrospective and there is no change to the liability to make a contribution. It involves NICs that the individual and his or her employer would already have paid if they had not entered into the avoidance scheme. The taxpayer can continue to dispute the case and will be repaid with interest if they succeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/20">It has also been suggested that taxpayers are likely to find it difficult to find the money to pay. The Government&#8217;s view is that we would expect a prudent taxpayer to anticipate that an avoidance scheme might not deliver savings and would be subject to challenge by HMRC and that such a taxpayer should have made some provision against that possibility. I can reassure the House, however, that when a taxpayer has genuine difficulties in paying some or all of the NICs, HMRC will use its usual collection tools, including appropriately structured payment arrangements, to assist taxpayers in paying the required amounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/21">I have seen representations from businesses suggesting that they entered into such arrangements to reduce business costs and that the measures will now put unacceptable pressure on their business activity. The Government have put in place an attractive business tax regime and expect everyone to pay the taxes that are due. Avoidance involves trying to pass the burden on to the vast majority who have not tried to avoid tax and where business is concerned it involves attempts to gain an unfair competitive advantage against those who pay their taxes and do not try to avoid tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/22">I want now to take the House to the provisions in the Bill that apply new information powers and penalties to the highest risk promoters of tax-avoidance schemes. The provisions are also contained in clauses 3 and 4 and schedule 2. The measure was announced for tax in Budget 2013 and the Government&#8217;s intention has been to extend it to NICs at the earliest opportunity. A consultation on the tax aspects, called &#8220;Raising the stakes on tax avoidance&#8221;, ran until <phrase class="date" code="2013-10-04">4 October 2013</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/23">Hon. Members might also be aware that the Finance Act 2014 includes legislation that allows HMRC to issue conduct notices to promoters of tax-avoidance schemes and monitor promoters who breach a conduct notice. The Bill applies the tax legislation to NICs so that the legislation operates as one unified measure that covers tax and national insurance contributions. Monitored promoters will be subject to new information powers and penalties, which will also apply to intermediaries who continue to represent them after the monitoring commences. The monitored promoter will be named by HMRC and the naming details will include information on why the conduct notice was breached. It will be required to inform its clients that it is being monitored by HMRC. Clients of monitored promoters will also be subject to certain obligations that have a penalty for non-compliance and extended time limits for assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/24">The measure is part of the Government&#8217;s strategic response to avoidance. It will deter the use of avoidance schemes through influencing the behaviour of promoters, their intermediaries and clients and it is aimed at changing the behaviour of promoters of NICs and tax-avoidance schemes. Naming a monitored promoter should deter intermediaries from acting for them and clients and potential clients from using their products. I can confirm to the House that the measure is not expected to have any significant economic impact and that the cost to HMRC of dealing with the additional information and reporting it is expected to be negligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/25">Now that I have outlined what those provisions do, I would again like to address several points that have been raised during Finance Bill debates and by some commentators. It has been suggested that the Bill is too wide and will catch innocent promoters, but the Government disagree. To be covered by the legislation, a person must be the promoter of avoidance schemes that give a tax advantage, or that avoid or reduce a NICs liability, and to have made a significant breach of a threshold condition. The vast majority of promoters will not be in that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/26">Hon. Members may be aware that it has been suggested that this response to avoidance is disproportionate, but we disagree. The Government have made it absolutely clear that we are determined to crack down on tax avoidance. The vast majority of taxpayers pay the right tax and NICs at the right time, and should not have to subsidise those who participate in avoidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/27">One part of the Government&#8217;s strategy is to tackle the behaviour of the supply side of the market&#8212;those highest-risk promoters who design and sell avoidance schemes. We want to ensure that promoters who avoid their obligations to HMRC and their clients are made to change their behaviour, and the Bill achieves that by imposing consequences for those who do not meet acceptable standards of behaviour. It requires monitored promoters to tell HMRC about their schemes and clients, and there will be significant fines if they do not comply.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/28">Another argument that has been made against the measures is that they apply retrospectively. The House will not be surprised to learn that the Government disagree with that proposition. While the provisions involve looking back at a promoter&#8217;s past behaviour, they are designed to improve current and future behaviour. It is only if there is no improvement in the promoter&#8217;s compliance with their obligations that they are subject to significant information powers and penalties.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/29">I shall now describe to the House the provisions relating to the new targeted anti-avoidance rule that will prevent people from circumventing new legislation that tackles avoidance involving employment intermediaries. The proposed TAAR is set out in clause 5. The National Insurance Contributions Act 2014 strengthened legislation in respect of offshore employment intermediaries. It was specifically intended to address the non-payment of employer&#8217;s national insurance in the oil and gas industry involving the placement outside the UK of the employer of oil and gas workers working on the UK continental shelf.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/30">Hon. Members may be aware that the temporary labour market is quick to react to legislative change and to find new convoluted ways to reduce the amount of income tax and NICs that would otherwise be liable to be paid. Stakeholders have indicated to HMRC that intermediaries involved in the facilitation of false self-employment may set up avoidance vehicles with convoluted structures that are specifically designed to circumvent the 2014 Act. To dissuade such intermediaries, the Government propose that a TAAR is included in NICs legislation to deter such avoidance. That TAAR is similar to the tax TAAR established for the same purpose through the Finance Act 2014. The rule will focus on the motive for setting up arrangements&#8212;on whether it is to avoid NICs&#8212;and whether those arrangements result in less NICs being paid. To ensure that the tax and NICs TAARs operate as one, both will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2014-04-06">6 April 2014</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/31">Let me explain why we are bringing forward the TAAR now. The use of employment intermediaries as a way of avoiding tax has grown in recent years, and they are increasingly marketed and promoted as a way of avoiding employer&#8217;s NICs. The TAAR will dissuade some businesses from entering into convoluted arrangements to avoid NICs. The proposed measures will help to level the playing field for UK businesses and ensure that compliant UK businesses that facilitate the UK&#8217;s flexible labour market are not undercut by those trying to avoid tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/32">The Government have already taken action significantly to reduce the burden of NICs on earnings and employment through previous Bills. At Budget 2011, the Chancellor announced a &#163;21 a week above-inflation increase to the employer&#8217;s NICs threshold. Last April the employment allowance was introduced, which will benefit up to</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/33">1.25 million businesses, and next April the vast majority of under-21s will be lifted out of employer NICs, which will support 1.5 million jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.681.2/34">The Bill introduces further welcome measures and is both important and necessary. The modernisation of the way class 2 NICs are assessed and collected will make the system simpler and more straightforward and will reduce administrative burdens on the self-employed. The Bill also includes a package of measures aimed at activity that attempts to reduce the amount of NICs payable to the Exchequer. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.686.0/1">I thank the Minister for his introduction to this short Bill, which, as he said, aims to simplify the administrative process of paying class 2 NICs for the self-employed; apply measures from this year&#8217;s Finance Bill, now the Finance Act 2014, to NICs; and introduce a targeted anti-avoidance rule, TAAR, to tackle disguised self-employment made possible through employment intermediaries and offshore employers. We support the measures and so will support Second Reading, but we will examine in detail some of the expected practical impacts of the measures in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/2">As the House will know, national insurance benefits are funded by a system of compulsory contributions on earnings paid by employees, employers and the self-employed. Most of the income from NICs goes into the national insurance fund to pay for contributory benefits, including the state pension, contributions-based jobseeker&#8217;s allowance and bereavement benefits. Some NICs money goes directly into the national health service. NICs are the second largest tax after income tax, raising &#163;108 billion in 2013-14.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/3">The self-employed make two types of national insurance contribution. Class 2 NICs are paid by the self-employed at a flat weekly rate of &#163;2.75. A self-employed person can apply to be exempted from liability if their annual profits are under a certain threshold&#8212;the so-called small earnings exemption&#8212;which is currently set at &#163;5,885. Class 4 NICs are paid annually by self-employed persons on profits immediately derived from a trade, profession or vocation that are chargeable to income tax. Class 4 NICs are payable at a rate of 9% on profits between &#163;7,956 and &#163;41,865 and 2% on profits above &#163;41,865.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/4">Until now, payments of class 2 and class 4 NICs have had to be made separately. Individuals may pay class 2 NICs by direct debit either twice a year, in January and July, or monthly, paid four months in arrears. Alternatively, HMRC will issue two payment requests a year. In contrast, self-employed persons pay class 4 NICs with income tax on completion of their self-assessment tax return. From 2011, the dates on which payment of class 2 NICs is due have been aligned with the dates for tax and self-assessment&#8212;<phrase class="date" code="2014-01-31">31 January</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2014-07-31">31 July</phrase> each year&#8212;but payment of both has continued to be made separately.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/5">As the Minister said, when the Office of Tax Simplification looked at these matters in 2012, it suggested bringing class 2 NICs within self-assessment, and that this would being administrative benefits to self-employed persons and businesses. In July 2013, HMRC published a consultation document in which it noted that the present system places significant burdens on small business,</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/6">and that while class 2 NICs accounted for less than 0.3% of the &#163;102 billion-worth of NICs collected by HMRC in 2012-13, they accounted for more than 40% of national insurance-related telephone calls to HMRC and the associated processing work that resulted. The Bill therefore changes the liability for class 2 NICs so that it arises at the end of the tax year and not weekly, as now, and moves class 2 NICs into self-assessment, so that self-employed people can deal with their class 2 NICs together with their income tax and class 4 NICs.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/7">We support the aim of making the system easier for self-employed people and reducing the administrative burden caused by the current arrangement of having two separate systems for collection of class 4 and class 2 NICs. Almost one person in six is self-employed, so this is a significant issue affecting a large number of people. Making the system easier to navigate is therefore welcome and of genuine practical benefit for the self-employed.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/8">A number of specific issues arise as a result of this change on which we will seek greater clarification from Ministers in Committee. However, it would also be helpful if the Exchequer Secretary offered some further comments on the points I am about to raise, as that could help to clarify the issues ahead of Committee. The first relates to the maternity allowance. At present, 25,000 self-employed women claim maternity allowance each year. Entitlement to maternity allowance is not assessed on self-employment and class 2 NICs paid in a particular benefit year. Instead, it is assessed over a test period of 66 weeks up to and including the week before the baby is due. Collecting class 2 NICs at the end of the tax year means that some women may find that it appears as though they have not been paying class 2 NICs during the period needed to make them eligible for the maternity allowance.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/9">In order to address this problem, the Government have proposed measures in the Bill that would enable women who have not had the opportunity to file a self-assessment return and pay class 2 NICs to pay them early in order to secure maternity entitlement at the standard weekly rate. However, there is a danger that these proposals may be impractical. Women would have to make voluntary contributions before they filed their self-assessment returns, and this demands a very high level of forward planning on their part. The provisions may therefore require some additional clarification. If the Exchequer Secretary or the Financial Secretary have had any additional representations on these points&#8212;I know that some stakeholders have been raising such concerns&#8212;it would be helpful if they set out their thinking. The Minister will be aware that the Chartered Institute of Taxation has suggested that the Government should review these changes at the earliest opportunity&#8212;in two years, I think&#8212;to ensure that they have not resulted in a reduction in the number of claims for the standard rate of maternity allowance. Again, it would be helpful to have an indication of the Minister&#8217;s current thinking on this point.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/10">For the 650,000 self-employed households that claim universal credit, these proposals will have a different impact. Universal credit regulations require the individual to report their income, net of certain expenses, on a monthly basis. That net income is then used to establish their entitlement to universal credit. Certain safeguards</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/11">are built in so that if income from self-employment for an assessment period falls below a certain level, the claimant&#8217;s income is treated as being a higher amount called the minimum income floor. Because universal credit is assessed on a monthly basis, if a claimant has to pay all their class 2 NICs in one month, this could push their earnings under the minimum income floor, thereby reducing their universal credit for that month. Simplification should not come at the cost of hardship, We will press the Government for assurances that they have fully considered the potential impacts of this change along with the introduction of universal credit, and the interplay between both policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/12">The tax information and impact note suggests that the option of monthly payments will still be made available to self-employed persons and businesses. However, there is no provision for that in the Bill. A number of stakeholder groups have suggested that the retention of a monthly payment system would be of particular value to those on very low incomes who may struggle with one lump sum payment. Even accepting that for many people the total amount does not seem large or too onerous, of course that is not necessarily the case for those on extremely low incomes, and retaining the monthly payment option would therefore be helpful. It is not clear why the note suggests something that the Bill does not touch on. I would be grateful for some further clarification on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/13">The Chartered Institute of Taxation points out that there will be a gap of 22 months between the collection of class 2 payments for 2014-15 and the collection of payments for 2015-16 as liability moves from a weekly basis to arising at the end of the tax year. Thereafter, the payment of class 2 will be in arrears on <phrase class="date" code="2014-01-31">31 January</phrase> following the end of the tax year. This could potentially affect entitlements to benefits. Under the current system, the entitlement to many contributory benefits is based on the claimant having paid contributions and operating on a pay-as-you-go basis. Have the Government considered the cash-flow implications of class 2 NICs coming in up to 10 months after the end of the tax year, rather than being paid in-year as they are at the moment? Are they able to give us some more information on that today?</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/14">We will also seek reassurance and confirmation that moving class 2 into self-assessment will not adversely affect entitlement to contributory benefits. These are significant changes and the Government will need to ensure that they are properly advertised and that taxpayers are educated about them. We do not want a situation to arise whereby people have gaps in their payments. As I have said, NICs relate to eligibility for important benefits that people rely on. We need greater reassurance from the Government that they will have a full programme of education and information about the changes. It is also fair to say that we will need a relatively widespread publicity programme ahead of April 2015, as existing direct debits will need to be stopped. It would be helpful if the Exchequer Secretary could tell us what the Government have planned in relation to educating taxpayers who will be affected by the changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/15">As the Financial Secretary said, the Bill also extends measures introduced in the Finance Act 2014 to cover NICs, particularly in relation to follower notices, accelerated payment notices and measures to tackle high-risk promoters of tax avoidance schemes. During the passage of the Finance Bill we had an extensive debate on the issues</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/16">raised by the new provisions, which are the same as those contained in this Bill, and we will continue to press Ministers in Committee on the practical arrangements for the measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/17">On follower notices, we welcomed the amendment made on Report of the Finance Bill, which brought in a right of appeal on three grounds where a follower notice has been issued. Outside of those three grounds, however, the only other option will be for taxpayers to seek a judicial review. What further reassurances can Ministers give that follower notices will be issued only in cases that are on all fours, as it were, with the precedent or lead case, so that occasions where a taxpayer may have to resort to a judicial review are kept to a minimum?</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/18">It is important that the internal systems operated by Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs in deciding whether to issue a follower notice allow for the points of difference in a case to be considered, rather than the process amounting to a more straightforward box-ticking exercise to determine eligibility for a notice. Now that the Finance Act is law, I would be grateful if the Government could set out what further work has been done on the approach and methodology that will be adopted by HMRC staff and officials as they make important decisions about whether to apply a follower notice to a particular case.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/19">As the Financial Secretary has noted, there has been considerable controversy and heated debate about whether accelerated payment notices amount to retrospection, as we discussed in Committee. Although we have put to him the concerns of stakeholders and constituents from all over the country, I agree with him that, from a legal perspective, they are not retrospective per se. The issue is more one of tax liability that has already been disputed and of where that liability sits. We have, therefore, supported the measures relating to accelerated payment notices. The Government have assured the House that decisions about whether to issue an APN will be made only by HMRC staff with sufficient seniority who are at a high grade. The Financial Secretary and I have had a number of discussions about HMRC staffing and resources, so he will not be surprised to hear that I will be taking up those issues again.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/20">The Association of Revenue and Customs believes that HMRC faces a demographic time bomb, with more than half its work force aged over 45 and 18% over 55. That proportion is even higher at senior level, where about 30% of grade 6 employees are over 55. It is important to know how that will affect the implementation of APNs. We will need to be satisfied that there will be enough sufficiently experienced staff and that those who are due to retire are being replaced at the correct rate.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/21">We have pressed Ministers on the resourcing of HMRC, and I note the Financial Secretary&#8217;s comments in our previous debates about the expansion of the counter-avoidance team at HMRC. Again, we will pick that up in greater detail in Committee. Now that the Finance Act is law, we must keep a close eye on implementation and resourcing. Especially given the high level of interest in such matters, the first decisions made about follower notices and accelerated payment notices must be robust and stand up to scrutiny if they are to inspire confidence within the population of taxpayers.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/22">The Bill will introduce a new targeted anti-avoidance rule to cover the payment of national insurance contributions, which sits alongside the provisions in this year&#8217;s Finance Act aimed at tackling the issue of</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/23">employment intermediaries who falsely label workers as self-employed to reduce their tax liabilities. The problem is widespread, and a Government review found that at least 100,000 individuals working in this country were employed through an intermediary company that had no presence, residence or place of business in the UK. In many cases, the employee was unaware that their payroll was located offshore and that tax was avoided on their earnings.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/24">For workers falsely badged as self-employed, particularly those who do not know that that is the case, the impact is that they are not eligible for many of the benefits available for employed earners, such as holiday and sickness pay. This year&#8217;s Finance Act amended legislation directly to address the issue in relation to the payment of income tax. A worker will now be designated as an employee if they are under the supervision, direction or control of someone else, and in that case they must be paid through PAYE, rather than as self-employed people. That is a change from the previous designation, under which a worker was deemed to be an employee if they provided their services personally. It was found that many intermediaries could exploit the test by claiming that there was no obligation for the worker to provide their services personally, and to get around that, a clause was often inserted into a worker&#8217;s contract stating that they could send someone else to do their work, even though the employee in reality wanted that specific worker.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/25">The role of the TAAR in this Bill is to ensure that the new measures cannot be circumvented, and that workers who would be employed earners if it were not for the intermediary arrangements are treated as employed earners. The TAAR will allow HMRC to consider both the motive for setting up such an arrangement, including whether it was set up with the motive of avoiding NICs, and what was achieved, including whether it resulted in less NICs being paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/26">During debates on the Finance Bill, we supported the new measures and the corresponding TAAR for income tax, but we stressed the importance of considering the resource that HMRC would need both to implement the changes and to ensure that sufficient guidance was provided to those affected. The same applies to this Bill. In addition, we will continue to press, as we did on the Finance Bill, for further examination of the case for having deeming criteria to combat disguised employment in the construction industry, particularly where such practices are a significant problem, with self-employment levels at 40% compared with an average of 14% across all industries. However, the TAAR envisaged in this Bill takes us forward in dealing with the problem, and we will support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.686.0/27">With those points, I hope that I have given Ministers sufficient notice of the debates that we will have as the Bill progresses, and I look forward to picking up those issues in greater detail in Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.690.0/1">I rise to say a few words in favour of the Bill, which the Liberal Democrats wholeheartedly support. We are very pleased that it incorporates measures to deal with tax avoidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.690.0/2">The whole problem of disguised employment is rife across the country, and the Bill will go some way to combat it. The shadow Minister, the hon. Member for</p>
	<p pid="a.690.0/3">Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood), spoke about it as though people were unwilling to be disguised employees, but in many cases people are willing disguised employees who duly make savings themselves. I believe that the Bill will help to combat the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.690.0/4">The measures in relation to offshore workers are particularly welcome in my constituency, which has a large number of them. Some only realised what their real national insurance status was when they claimed their pension and found that their contribution record was nothing like they expected, because the payments that they thought they had paid were not properly rendered as national insurance contributions. I therefore very much welcome the removal of another anomaly in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.690.0/5">I look forward to the Bill passing smoothly through the House, as it so far seems to be doing.</p>

	<p pid="a.691.0/1">Before I begin my remarks, I should probably declare an interest as a member of the all-party parliamentary group on the freelance sector. As such, I am fully aware of the invaluable contribution that genuinely self-employed people, including freelancers, make to the economy. They play an increasingly prominent part in the generation of economic growth and prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/2">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" name="Shabana Mahmood">the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase> and the Financial Secretary set out, the main aim of the Bill is to make life a bit easier for self-employed people in respect of the payment of their national insurance contributions. That is more important than ever, given the structural changes in our labour market over the past few years. There are 4.5 million self-employed people, which is more than at any point in the past 40 years, according to the Office for National Statistics. Welcome though the changes are, the Government need to go further in supporting the self-employed because, while we know that the majority of working people are not feeling better off in their pockets, it is becoming increasingly clear that the self-employed have been hit particularly hard by the cost of living crisis of the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/3">The latest labour force survey figures from the ONS show that more than a third of the new jobs that have been created since the last quarter of the last Parliament&#8212;39%&#8212;are self-employed jobs. The self-employed make up one in seven people in the work force. The Institute for Public Policy Research recently described the UK as the</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/4">&#8220;self-employment capital of Western Europe&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/5">Although the Government like to boast that 2,000 businesses have been set up and have been &#8220;flourishing&#8221; in every month over the last year, that masks the true effect of the cost of living crisis on many self-employed people. Although self-employed people are included in the employment figures in the ONS labour force survey, they are not included in the pay figures. The Resolution Foundation has concluded that, were the 4.5 million self-employed people included in the labour force survey, average wages could have fallen by a further 20% due to the huge shift towards low-paid self-employment. Whereas the official figures show that working people are, on average, &#163;1,600 a year worse off since 2010 after inflation,</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/6">Labour&#8217;s analysis shows that the self-employed have been hit particularly hard and that their average incomes have fallen by &#163;2,000 a year. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies,</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/7">&#8220;the fall in average living standards was caused primarily by sharp falls in gross earnings and self-employment income.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/8">We know that the Bank of England&#8217;s Monetary Policy Committee has a range of views on the extent to which the growth in self-employment has painted a false picture of the strength of the labour market. We also know from a recent survey by the Resolution Foundation that more than a quarter of those who have become self-employed in the past five years&#8212;almost half a million people&#8212;would rather have salaried jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/9">It is for those reasons that the shadow Secretaries of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and for Work and Pensions have written to Sir Andrew Dilnot, the chairman of the UK Statistics Authority, to ask him to examine whether new measures are needed to take better account of the earnings of self-employed people. The truth is that they are working harder for less and that many of them are struggling to make ends meet. We must ensure that they get the support that they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood set out the Opposition&#8217;s concerns about the Bill. The first relates to clauses 1 and 2 and schedule 1, which will simplify the payment of national insurance contributions that are currently paid by monthly direct debit or in six-monthly instalments, so that they will be paid under the self-assessment regime at the end of the tax year. Although that simplified process will be welcomed by many self-employed people, there are concerns that shifting all liability for NICs to the end of the tax year, potentially to be paid in one big lump sum, could be difficult for low-paid workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/11">The Chartered Institute of Taxation recommended that the option of monthly direct debit is retained, and the Government&#8217;s tax information and impact note also anticipates that</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/12">&#8220;a small number may want to continue to make Class 2 NIC payments through a regular payment option.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/13">No such option is referenced in the Bill, however, so it would be helpful if the Minister cleared up that point and said whether there is any intention to include such a measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/14">There are also implications for self-employed people who receive universal credit&#8212;I say receive, but I mean when, or if, universal credit is ever fully rolled out, given the current timetable. Because under universal credit income is reported net of expenses on a monthly basis, as my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood said, if income falls below a certain threshold in a given month&#8212;the minimum income floor&#8212;the claimant&#8217;s income is treated as being a higher amount, and they therefore lose some of their universal credit entitlement for that month. NICs and income tax will count as such deductions, and in any one month liability may fall on both of those under self-assessment. That could result in universal credit claimants losing out in that month, which could set them back significantly for a longer period. The Low Incomes Tax Reform group has expressed its concerns that that shift could &#8220;spell misery&#8221; for some self-employed people, and create a system where</p>
	<p pid="a.691.0/15">&#8220;payments will be made much later and could affect entitlements to benefits in the meantime.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.693.0/1">I am following the hon. Lady&#8217;s argument with interest and she is making an excellent point. Does she believe that the annual assessment and payment of class 2 NICs will cause a big problem for people on universal credit? How does she think that could be dealt with? Clearly, it is part of their costs and deductions from income, which will not be known when they are claiming and receiving universal credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.693.1/1">I think the hon. Gentleman very much agrees with the concerns raised by Labour Members, and I hope that the Minister will have some suggestions as to how those potential pitfalls can be addressed. If not now, thought should certainly be given to that before the Committee stage to ensure that the most vulnerable self-employed workers, and those on lowest incomes, are not penalised by the change in processing national insurance contributions. We accept that there are clear benefits to reducing red tape and the administrative burden on self-employed people who would benefit from such a measure, but there are those in a more vulnerable position who could be forced into &#8220;misery&#8221;, as the Chartered Institute of Taxation puts it well.</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/2">There is also an increased administrative burden for those who are self-employed as a result of the introduction of universal credit. They will have to draw up two separate accounts&#8212;one for HMRC that they report yearly, and one for the DWP that they report monthly. Perhaps Ministers will provide some much needed clarity about the provisions that they intend to put in place to support low-paid self-employed people, so that they are not disadvantaged by the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood mentioned the 25,000 self-employed women who claim maternity allowance each year. Currently, class 2 contributions are the means by which a self-employed earner accesses entitlement to contributory benefits, including the standard rate of maternity allowance. In order to receive that, a self-employed woman must have paid 13 weeks&#8217; of class 2 NICs within the previous 66 weeks. That shifting liability for class 2 NICs to an annual payment to cover the previous 12 months&#8217; liability could mean that they fail to satisfy those criteria and are not able to access the standard rate of maternity allowance. HMRC&#8217;s consultation document from July 2013 flags those concerns. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/4">&#8220;The Government recognises that the proposals have implications for the way eligibility for&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/5">maternity allowance</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/6">&#8220;is determined for pregnant self-employed women and will be considering how best to ensure the changes have no adverse impact for the small group who might otherwise be affected.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/7">Despite the promise of that wider review of maternity allowance eligibility for self-employed women, the Government have settled on what has been described as a &#8220;wholly impractical&#8221; solution, whereby women must pay their class 2 NICs throughout the year of their own accord before they file their self-assessment returns at the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/8">The Bill&#8217;s aim is to simplify NICs for the self-employed, but the proposed approach is anything but simple. In fact, it places a much greater burden on some 25,000 pregnant women each year who want to access their entitlement to the standard rate of maternity allowance. The Chartered Institute of Taxation has labelled that</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/9">approach as &#8220;impractical&#8221;, and has suggested that a review should be carried out after two years to see what impact it has had on the claims of self-employed women for standard rate maternity allowance. Perhaps the Minister could respond to those concerns. Have the Government considered alternative approaches, and why have they settled on what has been described as an impractical approach for those women who could be affected?</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/10">My hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood spoke in depth about the anti-avoidance measures in the Bill, which were debated at some length in the Finance Bill Committee. However, I want to make the general point that the Opposition are committed to anti-tax avoidance measures. We believe strongly that everybody should pay their fair share. That is why we support the measures in the Bill, but what reassurances can the Minister provide for hon. Members that HMRC will be sufficiently resourced in order to implement the measures and the safeguards? My hon. Friend mentioned the demographic challenges that HMRC is likely to face in the coming years, and the challenge of the numbers of those available to ensure that the promised safeguards are put in place. Will the Minister provide reassurances on that? I am sure the matter will be debated at some length in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.693.1/11">To conclude, we have only to look at the Government&#8217;s past record on tax avoidance to understand why the Opposition seek those reassurances. The Government have got it wrong in some respects, such as on the UK-Swiss tax deal, and have over-egged their tackling of tax avoidance and the tax gap, which the National Audit Office recently said is almost &#163;2 billion lower than it should have been, and that the Government have mis-stated the situation. Ministers must provide reassurance for hon. Members and for those who are interested in the debate that they have learned those lessons, and that we will not experience tax avoidance in relation to measures in this Bill that the Government are similarly unable to deal with.</p>

	<p pid="a.694.0/1">This has been an efficient debate&#8212;the Bill was discussed at great length in debates on the Finance Bill. On that basis, I will not recap the purpose of the Bill or the clauses, which have been effectively discussed. However, it is fair, right and proper that I address the points made by Labour Members. Clearly, there is consensus in a number of areas&#8212;work has taken place in debates on the Finance Bill and discussions have been had&#8212;but there are a number of areas that I should like to address.</p>
	<p pid="a.694.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" name="Shabana Mahmood">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase> asked a number of questions. I will begin the debate on them now, and I have no doubt that they will be explored further in Committee. On the reform of maternity allowance for self-employed women, I challenge the assertion that the process is burdensome. As we have heard, the Bill is about simplification and introducing a degree of efficiency to NICs. Primary legislation and supporting regulations, and a revised claim process, will ensure that expectant mums are no worse off than they were under the previous class 2 arrangements. Right hon. and hon. Members will be pleased that HMRC and DWP are working together to ensure that the process is straightforward and simple for them. As I have said, that will no doubt come up again in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.694.0/3">The hon. Members for Birmingham, Ladywood and for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell) made a point on reform for the low paid and the impact of universal credit. It is fair to say that most self-employed people have the option to pay their class 2 NICs regularly using the budget payment option that is already available in self-assessment. Importantly, they are enabled to spread the cost of those payments. That is not legislated for in the Bill because the option to make the budget payments already exists within the current system of self-assessment. Once the Bill becomes law, the issue is how we raise awareness to ensure that people know about that. NICs are accounted for on an accruals basis, so the important fact is the time period within which the money is due rather than the date for payments. Of course, they will continue to be counted in the tax year, but as I have said, it is a question of spreading the costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.694.0/4">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood rightly asked how HMRC will ensure that it applies the rules fairly for all taxpayers. It is fair to say that that argument was rehearsed in Finance Bill debates. The Government recognise that there are significant new powers. Obviously, the system must be administered fairly and consistently for all taxpayers. To that end, HMRC will establish clear governance for the key decisions on which cases can be designated as followers, which disclosure of tax avoidance schemes will be within scope and on the appointment of designated officers for the calculation notices. One important point is that clear separations will be established so that reviews of follower notices are carried out independently of the original issuing team. In addition, clear internal guidance and training will be provided for staff within HMRC on how they are to apply the rules. That goes with the clear external guidance, which has been published by HMRC so that taxpayers and advisers know how the rules impact on them. This is about not only fairness, but transparency, so that there is no confusion. On follower notices, those who know that they are deliberately avoiding tax will also know that they are being looked at, which is important. It is fair to say that our determination to lift every stone, and ensure that those who deliberately avoid tax are actively watched and pursued, is unequivocal.</p>
	<p pid="a.694.0/5">The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North touched on wage growth for self-employed individuals. The self-employed community is growing, which is a good thing. This is about how we support them through the tax system, but there must be agreement that the only way to raise living standards is to tackle wider challenges and economic problems. We appreciate that times are tough, but this is about how we support hard-working people and the self-employed. We have increased the tax-free personal allowance to &#163;10,500 from April next year, which will save the typical taxpayer &#163;805 per year. We have also taken more than 3.2 million people out of tax altogether and cut income tax for someone on the minimum wage by nearly two thirds.</p>
	<p pid="a.694.0/6">There have been other effective measures such as the freeze in fuel duty and the freeze in council tax in every year of this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.694.0/7">There is no doubt that more discussion will follow in Committee, but given that there is a great deal of agreement on the Bill&#8217;s provisions, at this stage I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.697.1/3">Last Thursday during the business statement, the Leader of the House announced, following representations from and discussions with the Backbench Business Committee, that on Wednesday of this week the House would consider a motion to establish a Select Committee on governance of the House. The motion to establish the Select Committee has been found time additional to that already provided for Back-Bench business. Given the level of interest throughout the House and the importance to the House of resolving its governance arrangements in a timely manner, the Government have brought forward the motion to allow the issue to be considered and resolved after the moment of interruption on Wednesday should that prove necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.697.1/4">The House will be aware that the major item of business being taken on Wednesday is the general debate on Ukraine, the middle east, north Africa and security. That is obviously a significant debate, and it is important that the House is given an adequate opportunity to debate those issues. That is why the Government have agreed, on this occasion, to provide Government time for the debate on international issues, in addition to the statements and other debating opportunities that the House has had to consider those issues. I hope the House will agree that this business motion will facilitate the business of the House in a sensible way, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.697.2/1">We support the motion to timetable a Back-Bench debate on Wednesday evening on the creation of a Select Committee on governance of the House.

That is why we welcome both the chance to have the debate and the motion proposed to the Backbench Business Committee. I do not want to address the content of Wednesday&#8217;s debate now, but it is clear that the moment is right to consider splitting the roles of the Clerk and the chief executive, and that the House should have a process for considering that properly and in a timely fashion, so I hope that Members will support today&#8217;s motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.698.2/3">First, I thank the Backbench Business Committee for granting the debate on this important and topical issue. I must say that some of us had anticipated that the Government business would take rather longer this afternoon and that this debate would start rather later. I was given the information that we might have the debate this evening rather late last week, and despite the best efforts of my staff to contact right hon. and hon. Members to urge them to make a contribution, the message obviously got out rather late. Perhaps there was not much contentious business to debate today, either. Nevertheless, the debate is topical, coming soon after the Elliott report, which the Government commissioned following the horsemeat scandal of just over a year ago. I should declare my interests related to meat production, which appear in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.698.2/4">I first became interested in food crime when I was elected in 2001. We were in the middle of a foot and mouth disease outbreak, and the election had actually been postponed for a month until the first Thursday in June so that the outbreak could be contained and dealt with. Unfortunately, it went on well after the election, particularly in my constituency. Thousands of sheep were slaughtered on the Brecon Beacons in an attempt to control the disease, which did happen. At that time, farmers were concerned about the lack of checks taking place at the ports on meat coming into this country. They were particularly concerned about the seaports through which meat was imported and the airports through which illegal meat was thought to come. I tabled a ten-minute rule Bill to ask the Government to re-examine the checks and balances, and that was what happened.</p>

	<p pid="a.698.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Does he agree that the lesson that we have learned about food fraud is that we need spot checks on processors so that they do not know we are coming? We should go to them and find out exactly what sort of meat they are processing so that we can stamp out fraud, rather than carry out general testing all the time, which is expensive.</p>

	<p pid="a.698.4/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that point, which is made in the Elliott report. Intelligence-led monitoring is also important. Controls on food coming into this country have been tightened at the airports and seaports. Sniffer dogs have been introduced at</p>
	<p pid="a.698.4/2">Heathrow, and I have been there and seen them in action.

	<p pid="a.699.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. Of course, because we are in the European Union we expect that all food that comes into this country will have been slaughtered, processed or manufactured to a standard that would be acceptable in this country. Food coming in from third world countries is another matter altogether. One issue that I concentrated on when I first became involved with the issue of food fraud was the smuggling of meat into this country from Africa. There were various types of meat, but the most serious were parts of primates, including gorillas, apes and monkeys, which certain ethnic communities in this country particularly value. It was obvious that there was no scrutiny of the safety of these meats or even what they were. There was a real concern that not only animal diseases but human diseases could be brought in by this means. Much of the meat came from west Africa. The problem of Ebola today shows that we might still face a real danger from this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.699.1/2">I certainly welcomed the final publication last Thursday of the Elliott review of the integrity and authenticity of the UK food supply. We waited quite a long time for the report, but it was worth the wait because it is a comprehensive and well set-out document. It demonstrates the UK Government&#8217;s commitment to improving the integrity and assurance of our food supply networks. Professor Elliott&#8217;s report highlights that the UK has one of the safest food supply systems in the world, with a great deal of work being done to ensure that food is safe to eat and free from chemical and microbiological contamination, and all those involved in the supply of food and those responsible for developing and enforcing legislation should be commended for what has been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.699.1/3">More attention and more resources, however, need to be put into food authenticity and combating food fraud and food crime. At the beginning of the horsemeat problem, the important question arose about what was meant by adulteration and what was meant by contamination. As far as I am concerned, contamination is not the deliberate introduction into food of other substances&#8212;it happens by mistake or inadvertently&#8212;whereas adulteration is the deliberate introduction into food of mostly lower-priced commodities. That issue was certainly at the heart of the horsemeat scandal.</p>

	<p pid="a.699.2/1">My hon. Friend will remember that I had some involvement in the problems at that time. It was important early on</p>
	<p pid="a.699.2/2">to establish a threshold for contamination/adulteration that made sense. Otherwise, we would have been in the absurd position of testing every piece of meat and finding that it was contaminated simply because somebody in the room might be shedding human DNA or because the meat had been sitting in a butcher&#8217;s shop where beef or pork sausages were not in separate airtight compartments. The level of the threshold, it seems to me, was one of the most important early advances we made in understanding the issue and ensuring that we were not attacking the wrong problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.700.0/1">I commend my hon. Friend for the work he did right at the beginning of the horsemeat scandal. He provided us with greater clarity about what was involved and about the difference between contamination and adulteration. Of course, contamination is not something that should be taken lightly in its own right. Halal meat contaminated by pork, for example, is a very serious matter for the religious beliefs of some of our communities. I do not in any way view contamination as of little interest; it is of great interest, but it must not be confused with the deliberate adulteration of food.</p>
	<p pid="a.700.0/2">Food fraud is corrosive of consumer confidence, which has ramifications right through the food chain. The horsemeat contamination incident last year is an example of such a damaging effect on the food industry and on consumer trust. After &#8220;Horsegate&#8221;, a poll showed that only 56% of consumers were confident that the food they bought was what it claimed to be&#8212;a rather shocking statistic. This figure is far too high, and it is one of the reasons why it is so important that we are having this debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.700.0/3">Small businesses are especially vulnerable to food fraud, and according to the Elliott review, many have said they are struggling to stay in business because they are competing against those who cheat. That goes for farmers, too, as they grow the raw ingredients for the food industry and rely heavily on consumer confidence. It is essential to safeguard this industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.700.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way a second time. Does he agree that there is huge pressure on the processors to reduce their prices, especially from some unscrupulous retailers? Of course, if we drive the price too low, beef cannot be put in the beefburgers and other things start to get mixed in with them. Although retailers are not directly responsible for what happens, I think they play a rather bad part in the whole saga.</p>

	<p pid="a.700.2/1">My hon. Friend is completely right that food fraud is price-driven&#8212;there is no doubt about that. Food adulteration and fraud are as old as history, as we know from many centuries of experience. The watering down of milk was one such example, but an even more heinous crime is the watering down of beer, which should carry an especially heavy penalty!</p>

	<p pid="a.701.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point&#8212;one that is addressed in the Elliott report and one that the Government have accepted, as I said. I am very pleased that the Government have accepted all the report&#8217;s recommendations, so we should pay tribute both to the report and to the Government&#8217;s response to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.701.1/2">Following on from the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point, there was such a cross-Government forum for co-ordination on food at Cabinet level until May 2010. Up to that point, there was also more clarity on the responsibilities for food, as the FSA then had the responsibility for authenticity, testing and policy on compositional labelling of food, as well as on nutrition policy, which subsequently went to the Department of Health.</p>

	<p pid="a.701.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for generously giving way again. In his interim report, Professor Chris Elliott made it clear that he wanted to see both responsibilities returned directly to the FSA. In his subsequent final report&#8212;he has made it clear that it is because of the political difficulty&#8212;he has stepped back a little from that, but the suggestion is that he would still like to see this done. What does the hon. Gentleman think about that? Should these responsibilities be returned to the FSA?</p>

	<p pid="a.701.3/1">If the hon. Gentleman reads the full report by Professor Elliott, he will find that he responds to the concern that the final report took quite a long time to come out. He makes it very clear that none of the recommendations in the final report is the result of any political pressure, but are the result of his committee looking at the issue and coming up with what he believes are the best proposals for protecting food and consumers.</p>

	<p pid="a.701.4/1">No doubt the Minister will correct me later if I am wrong, but I believe that Professor Chris Elliott said he was loth to include the full recommendation in the interim report&#8212;that is, the recommendation that all the responsibility should be returned to the FSA&#8212;and made clear that that was because of the political difficulty of doing so. I make that point purely for the sake of accuracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.702.0/1">As always, the Chairman of the Select Committee has made a very good point. I listened to what she said on &#8220;Farming Today&#8221;. Was it on Thursday? I cannot remember. When one is up very early in the morning, the days may not be readily identifiable. Anyway, the hon. Lady made the very good point that the real problem with the horsemeat scandal was that we had never identified the point at which the horsemeat entered the food chain. There have been a number of prosecutions, but they have taken place on a very small scale. Whoever perpetrated this fraud on such a large scale is still out there, and is still, perhaps, waiting for an opportunity to commit either the same or a similar crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.702.0/2">The real problem is that we do not know where that horsemeat came from. Were the animals slaughtered in a registered slaughterhouse? Were they slaughtered in a farm barn? Was the meat properly looked after? As it turned out, there was not, we understand, a very big threat to public health, but that may have been due more to luck than to judgment.</p>

	<p pid="a.702.1/1">In order to prevent a Select Committee love-in, may I press my hon. Friend a little further? I think that the key proposal from Professor Elliott is the proposal for a food crime unit, with intervention by the police. However, even a close reading of the Secretary of State&#8217;s written statement does not make immediately clear what powers the police will have. Perhaps my hon.

	<p pid="a.702.2/1">I have not, but I was going to mention the establishment of a police crime unit, which I think is essential. This was criminal: laws were broken, and people should face the consequences. I hope that the new unit will ensure that those people are brought to book in future, that they are named and shamed, and that they will not be able to have a role in the food industry again.</p>

	<p pid="a.702.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for indulging me a third time. I rather fear that a few small operators may have been singled out for what happened, and that there are some very big guys out there who have never been thoroughly investigated.</p>

	<p pid="a.702.4/1">That is the point that I was trying to make. There have been a number of arrests, but on a very small scale. Certainly the prime operator in the crime has not been identified and brought to book. It is important for there to be a police involvement, but it is also important for there to be an international police involvement. As the horsemeat scandal demonstrated, the food chains are very long and convoluted, and the people involved often do not actually handle the meat at all. They are traders who buy and sell it without ever knowing its quality or composition. It is therefore essential for an international police view to be maintained.</p>

	<p pid="a.703.1/1">My hon. Friend has put his finger on it. As has already been pointed out, price is the driver of food crime, and as Professor Elliott said in his report, if major retailers or processors have a deal that is too good to be true, they should trace it to its source. Both processors and retailers have a real responsibility in that regard. It is no good saying that they have not the facilities or the wherewithal; they have the ultimate responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="a.703.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a very good and wide-ranging speech on the basis of his experience. He mentioned European and international co-operation, whose importance Professor Elliott has stressed strongly and repeatedly. Did he share my concern when, only a few months after the height of the horsemeat scandal, the European Commissioner for crime and justice&#8212;who deals with such collaborative approaches&#8212;remarked how preposterous it was that, at a time when we were seeking international collaboration, the coalition Government were seeking opt-outs on 130 areas of European co-operation on that very issue?</p>

	<p pid="a.703.5/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. I am tempted to give a long list of local butchers in my constituency, but I will confine the list to butchers in my village. Brian George operates a very fine butcher&#8217;s shop, and slaughters the animals in the back. I am told by the Welsh Assembly Government that the hygiene standards there are excellent. I also know that it is possible to walk around other butchers&#8217; shops in my constituency, and to be told &#8220;This piece of beef came from a bullock belonging to Mr Price of Llanafan&#8221;, or &#8220;Mr Jones of Drostre&#8221;. After the horsemeat scandal, there was a tendency to use local butchers, but, unfortunately, people now seem to be going back to supermarkets and more processed food.</p>
	<p pid="a.703.5/2">My father always used to say that he would never eat any meat other than in slices, because then he could see where it came from. Once people started mincing it up,</p>
	<p pid="a.703.5/3">he said, there was doubt. That takes me back 30 or 40 years, but it strike me as good advice which some of our retailers could have taken during the horsemeat scandal.</p>
	<p pid="a.703.5/4">Professor Elliott rightly observed that the main priority should be a &#8220;consumers first&#8221; approach. That returns me to the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40494" name="Ian Swales">the Member for Redcar (Ian Swales)</phrase> about the interface between the retailer and the consumer.

	<p pid="a.704.0/1">To press my hon. Friend on one of the points I made earlier, does he feel that the legal responsibilities of the retailer are sufficiently strong and that the penalties on the retailer in this case were sufficiently punitive?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.704.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40112" speakername="Roger Williams" colnum="704"  time="018:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0002.htm#140908-0002.htm_spnew62">
	<p pid="a.704.1/1">No, my hon. Friend makes a good point, and certainly there was a lack of prosecutions. Where penalties are imposed, they tend to be of a very low order. Some of this large food fraud involves large criminals, probably acting across-country. They get involved because profit from food fraud is equal to that from drug smuggling or human trafficking, yet the chances of being caught are a lot lower, and if they are caught, the penalties are a lot lower as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/2">Despite the Government&#8217;s having implemented many of the recommendations already, research done by Which? that tested 60 takeaway lamb curries and minced kebabs found that 24 of them had been mixed with other meats such as beef and chicken. Worryingly, seven of the samples did not contain any lamb at all. That is particularly worrying to me, given the area I represent and our dependence on the lamb trade. I was very pleased that recently our local authority prosecuted a restaurant that was advertising Welsh lamb, but in which inspectors found nothing but New Zealand lamb. That is obviously a fraud of its own kind&#8212;only on a small level, but even at that level, local authorities must take action.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/3">Since the publication of the Elliott report, Which? has conducted another poll through Populus, and it shows that there is still concern among the public. The fieldwork for that research was conducted between 5 and <phrase class="date" code="2014-09-07">7 September</phrase>, and the poll shows that, even after the publication of the Elliott review, over half of people are worried that a food fraud incident will happen again, a third are not confident that the food they buy contains exactly what is stated in the ingredients list, and, a year after the fiasco, nearly a quarter say that in the past 12 months they have changed the type of meat products they buy because they are worried about food fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/4">We welcome the publication of this report. The Government have accepted all the recommendations, but one thing that will give us cause for concern is whether the resources will be available to carry out all the recommendations, and if they are carried out, whether that will be at the expense of other good work that needs to be done in this area. In general, however, I welcome the report and the Government response.</p>

	<p pid="a.704.2/3">I am also delighted to see the Chair of the Select Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" name="Anne McIntosh">the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh)</phrase>, in her place. I see that she issued a press release last week, in which she says:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/4">&#8220;Many of Professor Elliott&#8217;s conclusions echo those made by the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Committee in its two reports on Contamination of Beef Products and Food Contamination.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/5">In particular, both the Committee and Professor Elliott raised concerns about the reduced capacity for testing in the UK and stressed the need for more Public Analysts to undertake such testing. The Government must set out how it intends to deliver this.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/6">We also welcome the creation of a Food Crime Unit which should help to deter criminals from seeking to defraud consumers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/7">I know the hon. Lady will speak extensively on those points, and I will return to them in my comments, too. I do not intend to speak for long. I just want to draw on several of the briefings we have all received over recent days, and I will begin with the National Farmers Union briefing.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/8">The NFU makes two very strong points which are worth reading into the record. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/9">&#8220;It is important that the costs of any new regulation, or the proposed food crime unit, aren&#8217;t pushed on to farmers, who weren&#8217;t implicated in the horse meat scandal.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/10">That is very important, because farmers may very well end up being looked on, sometimes unfairly, by Governments of different colours as the people who should be funding certain things, but this scandal was not of their making and therefore they very strongly defend their position, which is absolutely correct. The NFU goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/11">&#8220;This highlights the need for short, traceable, supply chains and the importance of food assurance schemes such as &#8216;Red Tractor&#8217;, which ensures high standards and traceability from farm to fork.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/12">The Minister may well wish to discuss such schemes that provide assurance to consumers that the products they are purchasing are safe.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/13">The Food and Drink Federation is a very respectable organisation that represents very respectable trade bodies that are, however, vulnerable to unscrupulous traders who damage reputations across the industry. As the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, the latest polling of consumer confidence demonstrates that the industry&#8217;s reputation has been damaged. It is not the reputation of those involved in criminality or unscrupulous trading that has been damaged, but the reputation of the whole industry&#8212;the good traders and good producers. The FDF says in the opening paragraph of its briefing:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/14">&#8220;The final report of Professor Elliott&#8217;s Review into the integrity and assurance of food supply networks&#8230;recognises that UK consumers have access to perhaps the safest food in the world. However any supply chain, no matter how simple or complex, can present risks that need to be adequately managed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/15">I want to draw quite heavily on the briefing from Which? It is extensive and highlights the eight key pillars identified in the Elliott report. It refers to</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/16">&#8220;the National Food Crime Prevention Framework for ensuring the integrity of our food system&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/17">and, of the eight key points, it starts with the &#8220;&#8216;consumers first&#8217; approach&#8221;, which must be the key priority of any Government. It goes on to talk about zero tolerance and states:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/18">&#8220;The Report&#8217;s call for the reintroduction of a central register of food law convictions should be acted upon urgently to ensure information is available to consumers to enable them to make an informed choice about the food they buy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/19">The briefing also talks about improved intelligence to pre-empt fraud and says:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/20">&#8220;We support the creation of an FSA intelligence hub and a &#8216;safe haven&#8217; to enable industry intelligence to be better shared&#8230;The Government should also address the need for mandatory local authority testing and sharing of information in order to identify problems and draw national linkages.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/21">I would very much like the Minister to address the local authorities issue. We covered it in when we debated puppies last Thursday, when my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> in particular said it is all very well us all wanting trading standards bodies and local authorities to do a better job, but if local authorities are not resourced, they are not going to be able to do the job we expect them to do. One theme that frequently crops up in the different briefings we have received on food fraud is that the quality of the job the public sector and local authorities are able to do varies across the country. It would be interesting to hear the Minister&#8217;s comments on local authority testing and their ability to carry out mandatory testing, and how to make sure best practice is replicated across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/22">Which? goes on to talk about laboratory services and says it</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/23">&#8220;supports the finding that a more strategic and effective public sector laboratory testing service is necessary.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/24">It also says that the Government&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/25">&#8220;additional &#163;2 million funding is welcome, but in light of the challenges raised by the Elliott report, a more systematic approach to ensuring future provision is required.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/26">I would welcome hearing the Minister&#8217;s comments on the Which? analysis that the &#163;2 million is very welcome, but is it going to be adequate for the task in hand?</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/27">On audits, Which? states:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/28">&#8220;The Government should now provide guidance and set minimum standards to help smaller as well as larger players understand the level of action that is appropriate, including the level of testing that is needed. It is also important the FSA leads national investigations and works more closely with local authorities to ensure effective enforcement.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/29">It then goes on to talk about Government support. It shares the report&#8217;s concerns about local authorities&#8217; resources being increasingly stretched. As evidence, it cites a 16.8% drop in food standards interventions and a 6.8% drop in testing the composition of our foods. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/30">&#8220;Our research has also found a huge variation in the way that food enforcement is carried out across the UK.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/31">Will the Minister tell us more about the standard and quality of testing across the different local authorities? On Government support, Which? goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/32">&#8220;The FSA&#8217;s audit process identifies areas of weaknesses within individual local authorities, but now needs to take a more fundamental look at the way local authorities are performing. The Agency must also have sufficient powers to intervene in particularly complex or national cases.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/33">On leadership and co-ordination of investigations and prosecutions, the Which? briefing states:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/34">&#8220;The report raises questions around the effectiveness of penalties and the limits of the current sanctions to deter criminal activity.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/35">I shall ask the Minister a question about that in a moment. On crisis management, Which? states:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/36">&#8220;The Report notes the need for timely support to the FSA from across government in the event of a serious incident.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/37">It goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/38">&#8220;The Report identifies the need for the Government to urge the FSA to be better prepared for responding to future food incidents.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/39">In conclusion, I want to make a couple of brief comments and ask a few questions of the Minister. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40465" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> pointed out to the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire that the machinery of government changes and the weakening of the FSA in 2010 was criticised by the National Audit Office, which stated that the changes had created confusion and offered &#8220;no obvious benefit&#8221;. The changes included removing responsibility for food authenticity from the FSA to DEFRA, which was thought to have been part of the problem. Do the Government now accept that that change was a mistake?</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/40">Professor Elliott&#8217;s report, which was commissioned by the Government, was due in the spring. It is now here, and we would be interested to hear about the delay and about what is believed to have been the softening of the recommendations between the publication of the interim report and the final report. The fact that the Government are accepting all the recommendations is good news, however.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/41">Returning to one of the points raised by the hon. Gentleman, serious criminality has been uncovered but, although investigations are continuing here and in many other countries, there has been only one prosecution for breaching food regulations and a lack of traceability of meat. Huge frustration has been expressed over the lack of accountability. Does the Minister envisage more prosecutions as a result of these recommendations, or does he think that the legal examinations and prosecutions have run their course? Are we drawing a line under that and moving on to change the regulations?</p>
	<p pid="a.704.2/42">I hope that the Minister will also comment on the eight pillars of the Elliott review. Everyone agrees that food security is too important to be left to chance or to unscrupulous traders. It is up to the Government to act, and I am pleased that they will be acting on the Elliott recommendations. We look forward to those recommendations being implemented, but the fundamental question relating to the ability to act revolves around the adequacy of the funding and resources to enable the appropriate agencies, the new structures and the local authorities&#8212;especially trading standards officers&#8212;to deliver the improvements that we all want to see.</p>

	<p pid="a.707.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow my fellow Committee member, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>. I congratulate him and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40112" name="Roger Williams">the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams)</phrase> on their contributions to the debate. Before I begin my speech, I should like to say how sad I was to hear today of the loss of Jim Dobbin. As a microbiologist, he</p>
	<p pid="a.707.0/2">played an important role in the health service and in keeping us all safe. He was a particularly delightful colleague, and I had the pleasure of working with him on the European Scrutiny Committee. Our thoughts are with his friends and family at this very sad time.</p>
	<p pid="a.707.0/3">The Committee met briefly on Thursday to consider the Elliott report. The Minister also gave a good summing up of the report, and I hope that he will now be able to respond to all our questions. I repeat the request I put to him on Thursday to update the House on the labelling and traceability provisions at European level.</p>
	<p pid="a.707.0/4">There have been two positive and, I hope, long-lasting developments following the aftermath of the horsemeat scandal. One is that buying meat more locally from butchers and local shops has increased incrementally. That is very welcome and I hope that it will be a lasting trend.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.708.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40620" speakername="David Simpson" colnum="708"  time="018:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0002.htm#140908-0002.htm_spnew65">
	<p pid="a.708.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Lady on her work on the Committee. I declare an interest in the agri-food sector. Does she agree that, even though it is a good thing to put in all the necessary strategies and traceability mechanisms, if we are going to root out fraud in the food sector&#8212;and in any other industry&#8212;we need proper deterrents? The perpetrators need to know that they will do time for this. No matter how big a company is, or the reputation that it has had in the past, penalties need to be put in place so that it cannot perpetrate such fraud again. Some people are making millions of pounds out of this.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.708.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" speakername="Anne McIntosh" colnum="708"  time="018:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0002.htm#140908-0002.htm_spnew66">
	<p pid="a.708.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. My hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire has made a similar point. I believe that the new provisions will address this; the use of the criminal law is important. The fact that the City of London fraud police were invited to carry out the examinations was illuminating, in a sense. They are very skilled in tackling business fraud and paper crime. I shall elaborate on that point later.</p>
	<p pid="a.708.1/2">The second development, which I hope will be long-lasting, following the horsemeat scandal is the emergence of shorter supply chains. A number of hon. Members have already mentioned the comments of the Food and Drink Federation and the testing that has been carried out. We must not forget the cost of that testing. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that such testing will be more regular. I welcome the fact that there will be unannounced testing and auditing of food companies. Will he confirm that the testing will take place not only on the basis of risk assessment?</p>
	<p pid="a.708.1/3">We can see the lengths to which the retailers are now going from the briefings that they are issuing. We must not forget that they were not necessarily in the best place. One supermarket&#8212;a leading household name&#8212;had not checked the integrity of its supply chain for months, if not years. That simply cannot be allowed to happen again. The Food and Drink Federation has flagged up certain questions for retailers. It has asked them to identify their key raw materials, asking the simple question, &#8220;Where do they come from?&#8221; It also asks them to assess how resilient their supply chain is, and how they protect their business from food fraud. This shows just how far the food industry has come.</p>
	<p pid="a.708.1/4">Like other hon. Members, I was approached by <i>Which?</i> magazine in advance of today&#8217;s debate. I took the precaution of contacting my local authorities in North</p>
	<p pid="a.708.1/5">Yorkshire. I am sure it took them time and probably some expense to go through the recent testing, but I have reams of results from North Yorkshire county council, Hambleton district council, Scarborough borough council and Ryedale district council. I say to</p>
	<p pid="a.708.1/6" class="italic">Which?</p>
	<p pid="a.708.1/7">that it would be helpful to know how extensive its survey was, because such surveys can be alarmist if the message goes out to consumers that our food is in any way unsafe to eat, and we have come on a long journey since the first horsemeat adulteration was found in January 2013. In welcoming this evening&#8217;s debate, it is important to accept that the Select Committee has not had the chance to consider collectively the final report and recommendations of Professor Elliott on food security, but it is very welcome that the Secretary of State and the Government have announced that they will accept all the proposals. I am delighted that the two reports on contamination of beef products and on food contamination that the Committee adopted last year form part of this evening&#8217;s debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.709.0/1">One important part of the report is where Professor Elliott says that he anticipates that the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology will be keeping a watching brief on how the recommendations are put into place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.709.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" speakername="Anne McIntosh" colnum="709"  time="018:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0002.htm#140908-0002.htm_spnew68">
	<p pid="a.709.1/1">Indeed. I wish to record how pleased I am that Professor Elliott has agreed in principle to come to discuss his final report findings with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.709.1/2">It is a matter of regret that no prosecutions leading to conviction have been brought&#8212;one might say that the horse has already bolted.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.709.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40187" speakername="Jim Cunningham" colnum="709"  time="018:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0002.htm#140908-0002.htm_spnew69">
	<p pid="a.709.2/1">I fully support some of the proposals the hon. Lady has mentioned, and I think there should be criminal prosecutions in this area and more inspections. Have there been any more incidents of horsemeat finding its way into the food chain?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.709.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" speakername="Anne McIntosh" colnum="709"  time="018:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0002.htm#140908-0002.htm_spnew70">
	<p pid="a.709.3/1">Not to my knowledge, but the Minister will be better placed to answer that. As my hon. Friend the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said, there have been instances&#8212;I believe this was in part of Yorkshire, but, thankfully, not in North Yorkshire&#8212;where kebabs and other takeaway foods were found not to have been what they were reported to be; we are talking not about processed food there but about other retail outlets. So we must be ever vigilant and the level of testing must remain high. The point raised earlier is key: consumers must now be at the heart of this process, as Professor Elliott has said and the Government and DEFRA have accepted. However, the second note of regret is that we still do not know at which point the adulteration or contamination, whichever we want to call it&#8212;my hon. Friend gave some eloquent definitions&#8212;entered into the food chain. This was a multimillion-pound business and, as Professor Elliott concluded, these events crossed 26 out of 28 EU member states, which is why it is so important that we must find out where the adulteration took place. Perhaps we will never know that, but if we do not, how can we say to consumers, in all honesty, that we can prevent it from happening again?</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/2">Importantly, Professor Elliott&#8217;s interim report identified two weak links&#8212;two particularly vulnerable areas&#8212;in respect of the horsemeat scandal. The first was slabs of</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/3">cold meat held in cold storage. The second was raw products, and ingredients of processed foods or processed foods, travelling the long distances that we now know they did. I will be honest and say that I have not had chance to go through Professor Elliott&#8217;s report line by line, but it is extremely important that the Minister reassures us this evening on the Europol aspect, where there has been wilful criminal acts. It is also important that he reassures us that the rest of Europe has tightened up its act. This is not just about Europol and Interpol. I go to markets regularly in my constituency&#8212;I tend not to go to abattoirs&#8212;and if someone were to string up a cow carcase and a horse carcase, I would be hard-pressed, ignorant as I am, to tell the difference between them. Professor Elliott did us a great favour by spelling out in his interim report, and repeating in his final report, the two most vulnerable aspects in this country. I do not think that he was being in any way alarmist, so we must not lose sight of the fact that he did say that we are still vulnerable to such adulteration in future. The purpose of the</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/4" class="italic">Which?</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/5">report is probably to say that the criminals will move on, and they have moved on from the meat, slab or carcase form&#8212;the processed form&#8212;to other retail outlets selling kebabs and other takeaways.</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/6">The Committee&#8217;s report and Professor Elliott&#8217;s conclusions show the concerns about the reduced capacity for testing, which has been alluded to by the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse. The Committee report stressed the need&#8212;we took powerful evidence in the Select Committee&#8212;for more public analysts to do the testing. The hon. Gentleman made the point well that it must not be the innocent party&#8212;the farmers&#8212;who should pay for that. Obviously, the closer to home it is produced and the shorter the supply chain, the more confidence we can have in our food and in our meat. I am a meat eater who represents a large livestock producing &#8212;meat producing&#8212;area. I want to make sure that we have absolute confidence in the production in this country, and I believe it is second to none.</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/7">Professor Elliott&#8217;s final recommendations are on the national laboratory service and the drawing together of the nine&#8212;I believe it is&#8212;public laboratory services. He specifically says that public laboratory services need to be protected, that they are in &#8220;a fragile position&#8221; and that the review should be seen as</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/8">&#8220;an opportunity to develop a sustainable national asset.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/9">A lot can be done through DEFRA, the Food and Environment Research Agency, which is in my constituency, and LGC, a major science service company, to develop these centres of excellence&#8212;that would be pleasing indeed. He goes on to say that the Government should:</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/10">&#8220;Work in partnership with Public Health England and local authorities with their own laboratories to consider&#8230;options for an integrated shared scientific service around food standards&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/11">The Minister must grasp that point and reassure us&#8212;whether it is the labs, the food analysts or the police&#8212;that they will be given a specific target and resources to do that. It is important that the Government address the potentially reduced capacity for testing arising from the stranglehold on local authority budgets. Will the Minister use his good offices to speak to the relevant Minister in the Department for Communities and Local Government to see whether this money for public testing and public analysts could be ring-fenced? That would put a lot of people&#8217;s minds at rest. So we need the national laboratory service and we need to</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/12">ensure that the level of food testing by local authorities remains high. These unannounced audits and tests by the food industry will be a very positive development. Perhaps we need to be reassured again that shorter supply chains are in place and will not be jeopardised in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/13">Briefly, the food crime unit will go to the heart of preventing food adulteration incidents in the future. We need to see real leadership. The fact that the new unit will be placed within the FSA is pleasing. There was some criticism of the FSA in the Pat Troop report and in our own report. It was felt that perhaps the agency needed to co-operate more with local authorities and with other FSAs across the European Union. I hope that the Minister will tell us that that will be a top priority.</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40465" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">The hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> rightly touched on the matter of crisis management. The Government must clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various agencies before another incident occurs&#8212;it could be an incident of food safety rather than food adulteration&#8212;and ensure that all incidents are regarded as a risk to public health until there is evidence to the contrary. That was in the Troop report in June 2013. Will the Minister assure us tonight that NHS England will make that matter a top priority?</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/15">The Secretary of State set out in her written statement that she would like to see the food crime unit set up by the end of the year, which is pleasing. Will the Minister assure the House that the resources will follow the responsibilities and set out who will pay? I was very taken by the two models set out in Professor Elliott&#8217;s report. The Danish model was found to be slightly less adequate than the Dutch one, but if we look at the costings on page 138 of the report, we find that they are very high for the Dutch model. The population of Denmark is 5.5 million, and the population of Holland is between 10 million and 11 million Obviously, the costs will increase incrementally; one figure that is mentioned is between &#163;2.8 million and &#163;36 million. Can the Minister explain how those costings have been reached and promise that the money will match the responsibilities? How does he think the money will be raised and who will pay?</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/16">Importantly, will the police have the ability to make arrests? Apparently, police in Denmark do not have that power, but they do in Holland. Under the Elliott model, the police will have the powers to swoop and investigate. Presumably, they will then be able to make an arrest. As concerns on that matter have been expressed this evening, it is extremely important that the Minister clarifies whether arrests can be made. Furthermore, will the Minister set up a detailed timetable for implementing the recommendation, confirm that the food crime unit will be in place by December, provide an update on labelling and traceability and tell us whether the police will have the right powers in this regard?</p>
	<p pid="a.709.3/17">Finally, in November 2012, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland alerted the FSA in England to a potential food adulteration problem, as meat was being sourced from the same suppliers. No testing took place in England until we had the horsemeat adulteration confirmed in January 2013. What reassurance can the Minister give the House tonight that we will not find ourselves in that situation again in a year, two years&#8217; or three years&#8217; time?</p>

	<p pid="a.712.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40112" name="Roger Williams">the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams)</phrase> on securing this debate, which is of critical importance to consumers, retailers, producers and everyone involved in the food industry. As I said earlier, I was Minister with responsibility for food when the horsemeat scandal broke, and I have to say that nothing has made me angrier than what was happening then. Not only was a deliberate fraud perpetuated on consumers who deserve better, but that fraud had a serious reputational effect on very good producers in this country who had no part whatever in what had taken place. Retailers who had good reputations were trying to do the right thing but were none the less affected. We must put in place systems that are as effective as they possibly can be to prevent such a thing from happening again.</p>
	<p pid="a.712.0/2">I am unashamedly a fan of British food and British food producers. We have some superb production in this country, and we should be proud not only of the quality of the food we produce but of the standards that we maintain day to day, week to week and year on year. We should deal to the best of our abilities with anything that sullies that reputation.</p>

	<p pid="a.712.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman and former Minister for giving way. He has great experience and knowledge of this area. One of the great things about Professor Elliott is the great emphasis he places on this safe haven of intelligence coming forward and on a strengthening of the powers around whistleblowing. When the scandal was kicking off, it astonished me that people were then coming forward and whistleblowing. Elliott is right to say that there is a cultural change in the industry. There are lots of good players out there, but there needs to be a cultural mindset change to encourage people to come forward.</p>

	<p pid="a.712.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. One of the earliest actions I took as a Minister was to convene a meeting&#8212;I remember it happening&#8212;at the Food Standards Agency with all the major retailers. I made it plain to them that they had a very real problem to deal with, and that that problem was not going to be resolved unless they were prepared to do the work that was necessary in terms of testing and of sharing information, which were not part of the culture of the industry at that point. I said that unless they were prepared to do that, it was impossible for the Government to take the steps that would help to restore the reputation of the food industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.712.3/1">Let me reinforce the point that the hon. Gentleman is making. Every food retailer was affected by the scandal. Nobody was left untouched. The most diligent retailer was also being conned by unscrupulous dealers somewhere down the chain. Did the hon. Gentleman get a sense that they were going to invest more in their own testing, or were they looking to Government for that investment? What was the balance there?</p>

	<p pid="a.712.4/1">We made it clear that testing was the retailers&#8217; responsibility. Retailers had not only a legal responsibility but a moral responsibility to their consumers to ensure that the material they put on their shelves was what they said it was. They had no doubts whatever that</p>
	<p pid="a.712.4/2">they had to up their game, and they did, and all credit to them. I have no criticism of the actions that the retailers took to meet the demands that we placed on them for this very comprehensive testing regime, which took place not just once but time after time to ensure that the incidents that had been identified had been eliminated and remained eliminated. I have one caveat, which the Minister may wish to address: I did not feel that I had the same level of commitment from the catering industry. I am worried that as a lot of food arrives unlabelled on tables across the country through the catering industry, that might perhaps still be a weak spot. I would like to think that continuing pressure will be placed on the catering industry to be as assiduous as I hope the retailers now are about composition, testing and ensuring the integrity of their systems.</p>

	<p pid="a.713.0/1">I enjoyed my hon. Friend&#8217;s tribute to British food earlier, to which I completely subscribe. Does he share my hope that we will do everything we can to maintain the high standards of British food as progress is made in the transatlantic trade and investment partnership? As negotiations continue, there is tremendous pressure from US agribusiness to try to weaken our resolve to avoid unlabelled GM food, beef treated with hormones and poultry meat that has been contaminated with chlorine, and we should do everything we can to resist that pressure and to maintain the standards that he has just praised, which I totally support.</p>

	<p pid="a.713.1/1">I see no reason to compromise on high standards of quality. There are areas that I think we can quite properly discuss with the United States in which the answer is labelling and letting consumers make the choice rather than simply having bans. Some of the areas the hon. Gentleman mentions fall into that category; others do not. I have no interest in hormone treatments being used in this country and think that it would be a very great shame if that were standard practice in our dairy herds. We have been down that road before; I remember having exactly that conversation 30 years ago when I was leader of the county council and American Pharmaceuticals proposed to bring in bovine somatotropin to increase yield in our dairy herds. As a Somerset representative, I would say that we simply do not want that. It will be bad for our cattle and for their welfare and it will also be bad for the industry as regards consumer acceptance of a very wholesome product. I have a lot of sympathy with what the hon. Gentleman says.</p>

	<p pid="a.713.2/1">I neglected to apologise for my late arrival when I intervened earlier, so if I was repetitive I apologise. A number of the complaints I received in my constituency from commercial companies concerned the fact that although we welcome an open border policy for free trade within the European Union, it has its downside as regards free movement, and there were not the border checks that there should have been. There is paperwork, and we can do many things with that, but there are not the necessary physical checks. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman heard that complaint when he was a Minister.</p>

	<p pid="a.713.3/1">I did hear that complaint and I must say that what was coming into our ports from outside the EU was a great concern of mine. I do not think sufficient</p>
	<p pid="a.713.3/2">precautions were in place, although they have improved since. Within the EU, although there were theoretical paper trails, when they were examined in the context of the horsemeat scandal they were found to be relatively easy to falsify. That cannot be acceptable and we need co-operation on that between member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.713.3/3">The paramount responsibility of the Food Standards Agency and of Government is to maintain the safety of food. I do not want anything to be done in terms of the composition that takes away from the primary responsibility of ensuring that when consumers eat something, they are safe from infection or poisoning. That is not to say that composition is unimportant. It gives consumers something other than what they think they have bought. As we have heard, for some communities that is of very great significance, particularly those that have religious requirements about what they eat, but anybody is entitled to be sold what they think they are buying according to the label that the product bears. If people are deliberately setting out to sell something other than that, there is a very simple word for it, and that is fraud. The title of today&#8217;s debate is &#8220;Food Fraud&#8221; and the significant point is the fraud, not the food. It is a crime, and one that needs to be treated as serious. We need the apparatus to ensure that we interdict when it comes into the country and that we ensure prosecution when people involved are in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.714.0/1">I am following my hon. Friend&#8217;s elegant words very closely indeed. The Secretary of State when he was the Minister responsible for farms and food, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40444" name="Owen Paterson">the Member for North Shropshire (Mr Paterson)</phrase>, promised that the perpetrators of this crime would be brought to book.

	<p pid="a.714.1/1">I find it enormously frustrating because, frankly, the then Secretary of State and I did absolutely everything we could to mobilise and energise enforcement agencies across Europe to try to ensure that the problem was traced. I can say now because I am free to do so&#8212;the Minister may feel more constrained&#8212;that I believe that at the root of this was large-scale, European-based organised crime and that more could and should have been done by other member states to get the bottom of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.1/2">It was a very convoluted story&#8212;we know that&#8212;and it was not easy, but I felt that having raised the issue very effectively in European Council meetings, obtained the involvement of the Commission and persuaded other member states to take it seriously, there was a palpable feeling once the press and media furore had died down that some member states were suggesting, &#8220;Let&#8217;s not push it too hard, shall we, chaps? Let&#8217;s not remind people that we had a problem and let&#8217;s just hope it all goes away.&#8221; I do not think that is good enough. I do not think that the UK Government took that view, but I am not convinced that others did not feel that once the storm had passed, it was easier simply to carry on as before. The trouble is that that meant that those people who were making an awful lot of money&#8212;we are talking about huge sums of money across a European nexus&#8212;continued to do so, which means that the problem will arise again.</p>
	<p pid="a.714.1/3">We in this country and manufacturers and retailers across Europe made the situation worse through the complexity of the supply chain. That has been mentioned time and again, and the more we looked into it, the more extraordinary seemed the number of different hands that some of these products went through across so many jurisdictions in Europe. One only had to look at the price of the finished product and the number of people who were supposedly making a profit to realise that that could not possibly be done in a legal way. Some of our big retailers, which have very sophisticated procurement offices, perhaps had some responsibility to ask more questions. They do now, but they should have been asking at an earlier stage about how so-called beef could travel all the way around Europe only to be sold as eight burgers for less than &#163;1 on a British supermarket shelf. It could not be done legally.</p>

	<p pid="a.715.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a fantastic contribution to the debate. Does he agree that one of the strongest recommendations in Elliott is that part of the due diligence, for want of another term, from here on must be that when those in the supply chain see an offer that is too good to be true, they must ask why? When horsemeat was being sold for a quarter the price of good beef, anybody looking at it should have asked what on earth was going on.</p>

	<p pid="a.715.1/1">They should indeed. People should also be aware&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40608" name="Neil Parish">the hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)</phrase> made this point in an intervention&#8212;that the more price wars we have in our supermarkets, the more dangerous it is for good, honest suppliers, and the greater the propensity for those in the middle to try to scrape an extra margin through unfair practice. That is why I worry when our major retailers engage in food price wars, because although it may seem that that is in the interests of consumers of modest means, it is not, because those people are just as entitled to get good-quality produce for the money they spend as those paying much higher prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.1/2">Although they are beginning to do this, retailers need to raise the status and increase the independence of those they employ to carry out testing throughout the supply chain. That will mean that if the testers suspect that something is wrong, they can say, &#8220;This has to be looked at,&#8221; and the matter will be considered at board level so that appropriate action can be taken. I do not want to start a hare running or to suggest that something very wrong is happening in the catering industry, but I worry that there is a real problem that the quality of products that sometimes find their way into catering establishments is not as high as those sold on retail supermarket shelves.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.1/3">The Food Standards Agency has a crucial role to play, but one of the difficulties that I faced as a Minister&#8212;the current Minister will face the same situation&#8212;was that I had no responsibility for the agency, so I had to answer questions in the House that were strictly speaking nothing to do with me, in the sense that the FSA had an independent role. The distinction is important, because the food industry&#8217;s sponsoring Minister should not also be its regulator, and we saw many years ago that if that happens, the public lose confidence in the regulator. However, it is important that there is the greatest possible</p>
	<p pid="a.715.1/4">co-ordination between DEFRA and the FSA. We had that, and I pay tribute to the agency and its officers for the work that they did with me and for their help, which I appreciated. It is important that such co-ordination take place at a high level.</p>
	<p pid="a.715.1/5">I worry that local authorities do not always play their part. We need a comprehensive local authority testing system. Some local authorities are very good, but others, frankly, are not. It is easy for anyone to say, &#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s about resources,&#8221; but there is no direct correlation between the resources available and whether an authority does a good or bad job. It is more a case of whether an authority recognises that it has an essential and primary responsibility to keep people in its area safe. Just as central Government have a responsibility, so does local government, so local authorities need to carry out testing. There is a question about the laboratory service&#8212;the recommendations on the laboratory and public analysis services are crucial aspects of the package&#8212;but I do not accept that local authorities should be let off the hook if they say, &#8220;This is a low-priority area and we want to spend our money elsewhere. It&#8217;s all the Government&#8217;s fault.&#8221; That is not the case, and local authorities must recognise their responsibilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.716.0/1">I take the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point that resourcing is no guarantee of local authorities providing good services, because there are some very good authorities and others that are not so good. The practice of various local authorities shows that this is not a party political issue either. However, one of the Elliott report&#8217;s main recommendations is that there should be an examination of what is happening in local authorities so that we can identify the good guys and those who are not doing such a good job, find out what is best practice and how it can be achieved, and then share that information.</p>

	<p pid="a.716.1/1">I entirely agree, although I suspect that the Food Standards Agency knows an awful lot of that information already because it works directly with local authorities from day to day and will know of the results it receives from local authority analysts.</p>
	<p pid="a.716.1/2">We must not set out rigid structures for the FSA that impose testing regimes for no benefit. The system must be based on intelligence and proportionality. Earned recognition, if appropriate, is an important way of redirecting resources effectively but, as Professor Elliott says, that must be coupled with spot checks to ensure that what one thinks is going on is actually going on. Nevertheless, it would be foolish to redirect FSA resources, which are always under pressure owing to the extent of its responsibilities, to testing that serves no useful purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.716.1/3">I understand exactly what Professor Elliott says about the concept of a food crime unit, but I have a concern. Food crime and fraud covers a wide spectrum of offences, ranging from low-scale inadvertence and very minor adulteration&#8212;frankly, it is not difficult to pick up and prosecute such practice, and it should be well within local authority or FSA officials&#8217; power to take appropriate action to deal with it&#8212;to the large-scale fraud that the horsemeat scandal revealed, which I think is based on organised crime. Such fraud might require action at a much higher level, such as through the National Crime Agency, and to deal with that sort of organised crime, we need a sophisticated approach and co-operation with counterparts throughout the world, such as Interpol</p>
	<p pid="a.716.1/4">and Europol. I worry that if we are not careful, the food crime unit could fall betwixt and between those two ends of the spectrum, and we might have something that is ineffective at dealing with the big guys, but over-designed for the little guys. The Government need to give serious thought to the terms of reference and composition of the food crime unit, as well as to how it reports and feeds into the gangbusters in the NCA.</p>
	<p pid="a.716.1/5">The one thing that worried me enormously when I was a DEFRA Minister&#8212;it still worries me enormously, and I think it will worry me more and more&#8212;was the resilience of the Department itself. DEFRA is a good Department. It does an awful lot of good work and has to cover a huge number of contingencies, but its funding and resources are now such that it would find it difficult to deal with a major incident. I hope that the Treasury and leaders in government recognise that if we have a major incident to which DEFRA is unable to respond, the consequences could be enormously damaging. I am not saying that we are at that point yet, but we must be cautious that we ensure that we do not stretch what is already a thin line&#8212;a thin blue line, red line or whatever; let us think of a colour&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.717.2/1">I apologise for missing the opening few remarks in this important debate, and I warmly congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40112" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams)</phrase> on securing it. It is a privilege to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.2/2">I draw Members&#8217; attention to my declaration of interests. As a proud Yorkshire farmer who supplies genuine Maris Piper potatoes to a well known Canadian French fry producer with a factory in Scarborough, based in Yorkshire, I could not pass up the opportunity to say a few words in this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.2/3">It is reassuring that Professor Elliott has commended the British food industry so highly for providing one of the safest food supply markets in the world. The report acknowledges the importance of developing shorter supply chains and securing domestically produced food for a more resilient food network. Indeed, I hope that hon. Members in all parts of the House will join me in recognising the hard work of British farmers, who have invested to provide us with such high-quality produce. We must do all we can to strengthen our nation&#8217;s food security, increase investment and maintain our international reputation for producing the finest quality produce anywhere in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.2/4">As has been made abundantly clear, however, the problem is increasingly complex retail supply chains, which can make accurate tracing of food all but impossible. According to the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the factory that supplied a British supermarket with burgers made up with 30% horsemeat sourced the ingredients from 40 different suppliers. In such a long, complicated and unaccountable supply</p>
	<p pid="a.717.2/5">chain, the opportunity for fraud is sadly all too clear. Having familiarised myself with Professor Elliott&#8217;s excellent report, I agree entirely with the emphasis he places on the eight identified pillars of food integrity. It is, however, essential that we do not overlook the most effective way of ensuring the integrity and assuring the quality of our food: buying British produce.</p>

	<p pid="a.718.0/1">On supporting British food and farming, does my hon. Friend celebrate as I do recent moves by DEFRA to encourage much greater use of the &#163;2 billion or so we spend each year on food for schools, hospitals, military barracks and the like on domestic produce, so that a far greater volume of funds will be used to source and access good-quality local food for our children, patients and so on than was the case before?</p>

	<p pid="a.718.1/1">I entirely agree with my hon. Friend, who makes the point well. It is important that the Government, of which DEFRA is one Department, lead by example, and I feel that they are doing that.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.1/2">In the wake of the horsemeat scandal, it was clear that consumers want to see more British food on the shelves of supermarkets. They want to buy more British food and eat more British food, whether they get it through schools and hospitals, or by buying it in their local supermarket and from local producers. Buying British food is important, because animal welfare in our country is second to none. Our farmers are rightly proud of their world-beating record, which sets us apart from other global producers. We must celebrate that. For me, that is a gold standard, which we have to maintain.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.1/3">I draw the House&#8217;s attention to the fantastic but often overlooked red tractor assurance scheme, which was mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase>. The logo, with the Union flag, shows not only that the food was produced in the UK, but that the highest standards of animal welfare, food safety, traceability and environmental management have been rigorously enforced. Almost 90,000 farmers now take part in the scheme, and the retail value of food carrying the logo is now estimated to be more than &#163;12 billion a year. Next week is red tractor week, and I urge everyone to support the scheme where possible. Young people are being asked to become red tractor recruits, to spread the word of high-quality British produce on social media. Sadly, I can no longer claim to be a young person, nor have I ever been an avid tweeter, unlike some other Members, but I hope my contribution will convince some consumers to put British produce into their shopping basket&#8212;or to buy local, which we have not touched on yet&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.718.2/1">Yes we have.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.718.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40683" speakername="Julian Sturdy" colnum="718"  time="019:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0003.htm#140908-0003.htm_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.718.3/1">I do apologise&#8212;buying local has been talked about already, but it is worth mentioning again. The best form of traceability and quality assurance is to go down to the local butcher, greengrocer or fishmonger and buy local. When we buy local, we know where the food has come from&#8212;we can ask the butcher where the meat has come from, even down to the individual farm.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/2">The importance of farming to our economy should not be underestimated. Food production and farming contributes almost &#163;100 billion to the British economy</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/3">each year, employing almost 4 million people in the process. We can be proud that farming remains a family affair, with 90% of the more than 140,000 registered farming businesses run as sole traders or family partnerships. Food and drink products are now the country&#8217;s fourth largest export sector, with sales booming by about 5% a year. Indeed, some of the UK&#8217;s most lucrative exports are now from the farming sector, with lamb exports up 8% year on year, cheese exports up 9% and dairy produce up an incredible 18%. Such successes play an important part in creating jobs and fuelling our economic recovery and must be encouraged to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/4">We must also take the necessary steps to safeguard our hard-won reputation of excellence, which could easily be jeopardised by rogue elements operating in an increasingly complex international marketplace. Professor Elliott rightly calls for a zero tolerance approach as one of the pillars of food integrity. I understand that, at the request of the Food Standards Agency, the Sentencing Council is considering whether there is an opportunity to provide fresh guidance on food and hygiene offences. I urge that tough sanctions be brought to bear on anyone who would not only jeopardise the health of British consumers, but cheapen the reputation of the agricultural industry, which farmers have worked so hard to rebuild after the scares of the 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/5">I welcome the Secretary of State&#8217;s response to the report, which recognises not only the value of British farming, but the importance of educating children about quality food. Cookery and food education will be a vital part of the national curriculum, and young children will now enjoy a much better understanding, not only of where their food comes from, but of why it is so important to eat fresh and healthy produce.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/6">I could not let this debate pass without mentioning food security, as it remains a fundamental concern across the country. We are only 68% self-sufficient in food&#8212;a level that has, sadly, steadily declined over the past 20 years. Well meaning but poorly implemented schemes such as the common agricultural policy have limited our ability to increase food production in a sustainable way. Our competitive edge in quality and our capacity to increase yields can be promoted only through better understanding of the farming sector and investments in new technology.</p>
	<p pid="a.718.3/7">It is all too easy to forget that the industrial revolution began with a revolution in Britain&#8217;s farming practices, transforming our island nation into the world&#8217;s foremost power for more than a century. With such a proud heritage we must remain focused on increasing yields, boosting exports and safeguarding our gold standards in quality produce and animal welfare.</p>

	<p pid="a.719.0/1">I congratulate all right hon. and hon. Members who have contributed. We may be few in number, but we have had a very insightful debate with a lot of quality in the speeches, with more to come as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">The hon. Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase>, in response to an intervention, accused me of bringing politics into the debate&#8212;heaven forfend! That is my day job; I am a politician. I try to deal with evidence and rationality, but I am also elected democratically and I</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/3">am a politician. If the hon. Gentleman, who is no longer in his place, does not understand that, I will happily sit down with him over a coffee.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/4">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40112" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams)</phrase> on introducing the debate. We go back a very long way. He talked about the 2001 election, which was delayed because of foot and mouth. I recall that well, because we were sparring partners, but he was also seeing daily, alongside farmers, the horror of the burning carcases. He has great experience in this area. He reminded us of the importance of Elliott, food fraud, food criminality, traceability and all the aspects of this to the farming community. As many hon. Members have said, those who are often hit really badly by this are the primary producers&#8212;farmers. It is they who get squeezed, whether in price wars or in burdens being laid on them. We need to guard against that.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/5">The hon. Gentleman, like many others, strongly supports the proposals in the Elliott report. As hon. Members will know, I have spent my weekend poring over every line and word of it, as well as other briefings and so on. Professor Elliott makes it crystal clear that not only the eight pillars of food integrity but every detail must hold together. These proposals are not to be cherry-picked; equal effort must be put into every aspect.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/6">During an intervention on the hon. Gentleman, we briefly discussed the FSA&#8217;s interim proposals, which some would argue have different emphasis from the final report. However, it is about more than degrees of emphasis, because the Troop proposals mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" name="Anne McIntosh">the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh)</phrase>, who chairs the EFRA Committee, among others, expressed a preference for putting these responsibilities into the FSA. Even though this is slightly modified in the report, Elliott makes it clear that if that is not going to be the case, he wants the matter to be pursued in a different way with equal rigour and clarity. Let us see how it emerges.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> has great experience in these matters. I served alongside him when he was the Minister responsible for food, farming and agriculture. He brought a great deal of experience to bear, as he always does in these debates. He talked about not having the full impact of this falling on farming communities. He discussed, as did others, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40683" name="Julian Sturdy">the hon. Member for York Outer (Julian Sturdy)</phrase>, the importance of the red tractor assurance scheme. That is an important element of some of the briefings from the National Farmers Union, the Food and Drink Federation, and <i>Which?</i> magazine&#8212;I am sorry, not <i>Which?</i> magazine but Which? the consumers association. It used to be a magazine when I was a young man but now it is far more than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/8">My hon. Friend said that Elliott is proposing not to increase burdens but to reduce the burdens on the good guys and put the burdens on to the bad guys and the criminals. He talked about the importance of a strategic laboratory service, which is crucial. He asked whether the resources were sufficient for this very wide-ranging set of proposals to do Elliott justice. He referred to the machinery of government changes in the FSA. Like many Members, he queried why prosecutions are so few and far between and often do not go after the big fish in the pond.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/9">The hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton has a great deal of experience in this area. I commend not only her speech but the work that the EFRA Committee has</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/10">done over time on putting a spotlight on to this issue with considerable detail and forensic analysis. She opened her remarks by paying tribute to a friend of all of us right across the House&#8212;the late Jim Dobbin. We are all very sad and our thoughts are with his family. One of his great causes related to DEFRA&#8212;open access and the right to roam. There is nothing more political than putting one foot in front of the other and walking out into the countryside. He was a great believer in that. In fact, I have a debate about such matters on Wednesday afternoon in Westminster Hall, and anybody who wants to can come and take part.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/11">The hon. Lady talked about the desirability of shorter supply chains. A lot of the retailers have &#8220;got&#8221; that now, but we have to keep the pressure on. On the day of the National Farmers Union conference a year ago, one retailer&#8212;I will not name it for fear of embarrassment but it knows who it is&#8212;took out full-page adverts with a big banner headline saying, &#8220;We get it&#8221;, that talked about how it would transform its business. I have met it subsequently, and it is trying to do that. It is our biggest supermarket chain. A lot of farmers are now watching for it to carry that through relentlessly.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/12">In an intervention on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40620" name="David Simpson">the hon. Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson)</phrase>, the hon. Lady talked about penalties, which the hon. Member for York Outer also mentioned. We need to consider not only what the Sentencing Council is doing, and stronger penalties, but broader penalties so that some of these cases do not have to end up in court. That could be to do with naming and shaming, but there might be McCrory-style types of penalties that deal in the right way with relatively minor offences early on and deal in a heavy-duty way with the big offenders as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.719.0/13">It was asked whether more incidents have taken place post-horsemeat. It is interesting to refer to the very good House of Commons Library briefing, which draws on Elliott&#8217;s observation that in 2007 there were 49 reports of food fraud to the FSA&#8217;s food fraud database, while in 2013 it received 1,538 reports. According to the National Audit Office, local authorities reported 1,380 cases of food fraud in 2012, up by two thirds since 2010. That is the scale of what we are looking at. That emphasises the importance of local authority intelligence, which a few hon. Members mentioned, and of how this ties together. It will not all be carried out by serious crime people; local information on the ground will open it out.</p>

	<p pid="a.721.0/1">As I hope the hon. Gentleman will confirm, there is not sufficient intelligence. A lot of the testing is done purely on the basis of risk assessment. The key is not just the food crime unit but the fact that there will be spot checks&#8212;unannounced audits. Surely that has to be a good thing.</p>

	<p pid="a.721.1/1">I could not agree more. I hope that the Minister will also say that that is the way forward. It is not only about routine checks or risk assessment-based checks but turning up unannounced.</p>
	<p pid="a.721.1/2">The hon. Lady rightly made a point about Troop and the FSA leadership, and clarity of roles. She also talked about the police&#8217;s powers of arrest, and I will be interested in the Minister&#8217;s response to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.721.1/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" name="David Heath">The hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)</phrase>, a former Minister in the Department who also has great experience, discussed the importance of cultural change,</p>
	<p pid="a.721.1/4">which is crucial. He rightly talked about the importance of driving this through every area, including catering. It has to go deep into every individual sector and employee as well as the bosses and the leadership. The importance of caterers was brought home in the horsemeat scandal, because horsemeat was appearing not only in hospitals and schools but in the food used by caterers who were supplying Royal Ascot and the royal family&#8212;so at least we were all in it together.</p>
	<p pid="a.721.1/5">On the complexity of the supply chain, Elliott says that we have to recognise that, even though it is more desirable to have shorter supply chains and to encourage food retailers and providers to move towards them, we are in a global system, under which global intelligence and the pursuit of crime come into play. He also says, wisely, that ultimately the food price wars that take place from time to time, including now, are not good for the consumer if they jeopardise food authenticity or&#8212;heaven help us&#8212;food safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.721.1/6">The hon. Member for York Outer spoke up strongly for British farming and food produce. He talked about the gold standard of British farming and I agree with him. Curiously, when we were on the Government Benches, others would shout at us about gold-plating, but that is exactly the gold standard he was talking about. That is the reason our exports to many other countries are doing well&#8212;they demand the standards of animal welfare, hygiene and testing that this country delivers. Regulation is a darn good thing when it protects the consumer and allows us to export around the world. Curiously, the FSA has traditionally been looked on as the gold standard of food regulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.721.1/7">The hon. Gentleman also talked wisely about the importance of knowing where our food actually comes from. There is a great deal of work to do on that right across the population, ourselves included. There is real value in knowing where food comes from; it ties into so many good things.</p>
	<p pid="a.721.1/8">The Labour party is very clear&#8212;as we were when we were in government&#8212;that the consumer has always to be put first. That is why, when in government, we established a strong and independent Food Standards Agency, which had a powerful reach right across Government to regulate this vital industry that creates so many jobs and that wants the very highest standards. However, the changes brought about by tinkering with the machinery of Government have jeopardised that.</p>

	<p pid="a.722.0/1">Professor Elliott says in his report that when the FSA had control of authenticity testing in 2007-08, under the previous Government, it took the decision, as an independent body, to cut spending on the testing programme. If the hon. Gentleman had been a Minister at the time and had received a submission recommending such a cut, would he have agreed with it or might he have questioned it?</p>

	<p pid="a.722.1/1">I was not the Minister at the time, but I would like the hon. Gentleman to continue to make his point, because Professor Chris Elliott was unable to address the detail. Will he confirm whether authenticity testing continued even though it had been reduced?</p>

	<p pid="a.723.0/1">Yes, it continued, but the point Elliott makes is that the FSA, as an independent body, took the decision to start winding down authenticity testing.</p>

	<p pid="a.723.1/1">Let me put it back to the hon. Gentleman: when the coalition Government entered office in 2010, one of their first decisions in DEFRA was to split away authenticity testing. At that point, did they think it was appropriate to increase investment in it? We could go back and forth on this issue, but authenticity testing was still happening at that time, even if it had been reduced. I am interested in the detail, but it was continuing.</p>

	<p pid="a.723.2/1">It is very important to distinguish between the testing regime that remains within the province of the FSA and local authorities, which continued according to their priorities, and the policy developed by civil servants, which was moved to DEFRA in order to inform Ministers who were having to deal with very complex European issues of labelling and composition. That was perfectly logical. If there was confusion, it was not at the level of central Government; it may have been elsewhere.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.723.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40465" speakername="Huw Irranca-Davies" colnum="723"  time="019:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0003.htm#140908-0003.htm_spnew21">
	<p pid="a.723.3/1">After the horsemeat scandal erupted in February 2013, the National Audit Office looked at the contributory factors to any delay or confusion. One of the things it pointed fairly and squarely at was the confusion as to who was doing what. It pointed the finger at the machinery of Government changes. The hon. Gentleman, who was a Minister, may be saying that he was not confused, but there was certainly confusion between local government and Whitehall, as well as within Whitehall, as to who was doing what. I agree with Troop and with Elliott&#8217;s interim findings that it should be put back together again, but we will have to differ on that. The question for the Government is, can they make this work if they are not going to do that?</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/2">One of our criticisms relates to the fact that just before we left government in 2010 we published what was at the time a ground-breaking, comprehensive food strategy, &#8220;Food 2030&#8221;, which followed on from our previous work on &#8220;Food Matters&#8221;. It mapped out a comprehensive and long-term strategy to ensure the provision of safe, nutritious, affordable and sustainable food, but it has been left on the shelf. Where is this Government&#8217;s overarching strategy to pull everything together? The answer is: there isn&#8217;t one.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/3">Labour welcomes and supports fully all the Elliott report&#8217;s recommendations, and we will continue to urge the Government for full and speedy implementation. Professor Elliott sets out a new Government-industry partnership, some aspects of which will require a culture change in Government and in industry. He makes sound recommendations for a new food crime unit and a whole framework for national food crime prevention, encompassing Government, the FSA and industry. He calls for&#8212;it is interesting that he deals not just with the mechanics&#8212;a new mentality to meet the challenges of sourcing from complex international supply chains, and a zero-tolerance approach to food crime. He also fashions detailed proposals on whistleblowing, intelligence-gathering and co-ordinated laboratory and testing services, and stresses the need for leadership at all levels, including in</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/4">Government. Most of all, he stresses&#8212;he puts this top dead centre&#8212;the need to put the consumer first, and we agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/5">Labour supports the report and all its recommendations. We believe that the industry is ready to drive the culture that Elliott demands and that the consumer and the public deserve. I say to the Minister, however, that we have reservations: we do not have the same confidence that the Government are serious about these changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/6">Make no mistake: the Elliott report is not only a series of sound recommendations, but is an expert analysis and critique of the coalition Government&#8217;s policy on food governance and food crime. Since 2010 under this coalition Government we have seen the fragmentation of food governance; an ideological fetishism for stripping out regulation for the sake of it, whether that regulation is good for the consumer and industry or not; and front-line cutbacks in inspection at national and local level and in food testing capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/7">The Government have also been asleep at the wheel, reacting only when disaster happens, realising too late that cutting the brake cables and unscrewing the steering column was not a good idea. In 2010, one of this Government&#8217;s first actions was to split the responsibilities of the FSA, an agency that was, as I have said, previously regarded as the gold standard of consumer protection and industry regulation. It was deliberately fractured, which hampered clarity and leadership in food governance in the UK. It is not just me saying that; others are saying it, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/8">The horsemeat scandal was the slow-motion car crash that showed how crazy that decision was. The NAO stated that when a prompt response was required to the breaking horsemeat scandal, there was confusion between and lack of leadership in Whitehall Departments and confusion between Whitehall and local government.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/9">Similar, repeated concerns about the mishandling of the FSA and food governance have been raised for some time by the EFRA Committee and many other industry and food policy experts. Labour raised those concerns from the word go.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/10">The interim Elliott report made it clear that the FSA responsibilities should be brought back together. That would deal with the NAO view that fragmentation had led to needless confusion and additional complexity. The final report has stepped back slightly, but it is still commendably forthright on the need to put rigour and reach back into the FSA.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/11">On that and many other issues, the report carries implicit and sometimes explicit criticisms of this Government&#8217;s approach to food policy and food crime. It calls for a more robust FSA, retaining its independence, and for far greater co-ordination, which has been lacking, across Government and industry. It highlights the absence of high-level round-table meetings between the chair of the FSA and the Secretaries of State for Health and for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which seems to me to be a shocking omission and a glaring fault bearing in mind the fragmentation of responsibilities since 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/12">The report cites evidence from recent local authority testing that appears to show high levels of failure, particularly in meat authenticity testing, which possibly indicates fraud or the criminal adulteration of food. That is deeply worrying set against a near halving in the number of DEFRA officials working on food authenticity</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/13">since 2010, as revealed by an answer given to me by the Minister in July. It is even more worrying in the light of the immense pressures on local authorities, which have led to severe cutbacks in local food inspections.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/14">Professor Elliott does not pull any punches. He states on page 49 of his report:</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/15">&#8220;Enforcement activity is&#8230;very vulnerable when local authority services are cut to the bone.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/16">He also draws attention to the average 27% reduction in the number of trading standards officers dealing with food matters, and to the 40% cut in overall trading standards services during the lifetime of this Government. Concerns for consumer protection and for the reputation of the industry are heightened when, as Elliott notes, the number of public analyst laboratories has been reduced from 10 in 2010 to six today. I simply say to the Minister that he has his work cut out if he is to explain how, against the background of cuts in front-line FSA inspection, front-line local authority inspection and laboratory facilities, he can do what Elliott asks and put the consumer first.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/17">Given that we are now four and a half years into this Government, the Minister must explain why the UK has been behind the curve and behind European counterparts in establishing a food crime unit. That led Elliott to note that the Dutch crime unit could find no one in the UK&#8212;whether in a crime unit or anywhere else&#8212;to speak to when the horsemeat scandal happened. Had the Government&#8217;s reluctance to place any burdens on industry given them an aversion to being proactive in such a way? Had Ministers looked at the threat of food adulteration and food crime since taking office? I understand that the Minister was not in office for the whole of that time, but I am sure that he has discussed it with his officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/18">One month after the horsemeat scandal erupted, a survey by the consumer organisation Which? found that six in 10 shoppers had changed their shopping habits, and that trust had fallen by a quarter. A year after the scandal, an Ipsos MORI survey showed that 95% of consumers remembered the horsemeat scandal. As has already been mentioned, the latest polling by Which? has shown this month that 55% of people are worried that a food fraud incident will happen again, that a third of them do not have confidence that the food they buy contains what it says on the label&#8212;by the way, that goes up to half for people who have takeaways on a Saturday night&#8212;and a quarter maintain that they have changed the type of meat they buy. Seven out of 10 consumers have told Which? that more action needs to be taken. The damage is lasting, so we need to get this right.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/19">Let me ask the Minister some initial questions; in the months to come, we will return with more. As the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton suggested, will the Minister publish a detailed timetable for the implementation of every recommendation in the Elliott review so that the Government&#8217;s warm words can be measured against actual implementation? Will he give assurances that the resources for the new crime unit and the crime framework to go with it can be found from within existing FSA funding?</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/20">Will the Minister now apologise on behalf of the Government for the decision to fragment the responsibilities of the FSA, or does he continue to ignore the argument that that decision damaged its power, authority and independence? Does he accept the Elliott proposal that</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/21">the FSA should continue as a non-ministerial department so as to retain its necessary independence from the Government? How does he answer critics who believe that the FSA has gone beyond the necessary close co-operation with the industry and is now too close to the industry to be a useful and critical friend? The recent decision not to publish campylobacter rates is one such example.</p>
	<p pid="a.723.3/22">Bearing in mind the need for a more robust and rigorous FSA based on the report&#8217;s proposals and the need for the FSA to have the effective and independent leadership identified by the Elliott report, will the Minister give us an update on the search for a new chair? Will he confirm that the person shortly to be proposed as chair will appear before the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee before final confirmation in post?</p>

	<p pid="a.726.1/1">They will, which is great.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/2">What other foodstuffs are of primary concern for authenticity fraud, and which are on the priorities list for criminal activity at present? How will the Minister guarantee that the high number of authenticity failures can be identified now and in future against the backdrop of cuts in the front-line services involved in food authenticity? As so many hon. Members have asked, 18 months after the horsemeat scandal erupted, why have prosecutions been so few and far between? Does he share the public&#8217;s frustration that criminals appear to be getting away with messing with their food?</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/3">Elliott repeatedly argues for improved co-operation on an international and especially a European level to tackle food crime and fraud. Does the Minister expect us to believe that the Government&#8217;s general approach to European co-operation and the specific Tory proposals to opt out of 130 areas of European policing and justice measures will help the fight against international food crime? If so, has he done an impact assessment on those proposals? Will he support calls for an urgent review of criminal, financial and other penalties to toughen and widen the measures against rogues and criminals, and to protect the many good food businesses? Finally&#8212;for now&#8212;will he guarantee consumers and the industry that another horsemeat scandal or the like will not happen in the short time left of this Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.726.1/4">Let me end by saying that this Government have their work cut out to persuade the industry and consumers that they are serious about tackling food crime and fraud because, as they say in police dramas, this Government have got &#8220;previous&#8221;. Their track record of delay and dither when facing a crisis, their ideological aversion to effective regulation and their wholesale absence of leadership and strategic thinking on food mean that they are in the dock as a serial offender. We urge the Government to get serious about food crime, food governance and food strategy. We will support them if they drive through all the recommendations with the rigour they deserve, because consumers and this vital UK industry deserve no less.</p>

	<p pid="a.726.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40112" name="Roger Williams">the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams)</phrase> on securing the debate. He expressed some disappointment about the number of Members attending, but we have had a really substantive event; it</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/2">does not take away from the gravity of the issue, because the speeches made have really got to grips with the issues. Let me start by making it absolutely clear that food fraud is totally unacceptable: it is a crime, and this Government will not stand by while consumers are duped and deceived.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/3">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40683" name="Julian Sturdy">the Member for York Outer (Julian Sturdy)</phrase> made very clear, food and drink manufacturing is important to this country. It is our largest manufacturing sector, a significant contributor to economic growth and a big employer. British food is renowned throughout the world for its quality, and our farming industry is world-renowned for our high animal welfare standards. The integrity of our food supply chain is essential for the great reputation of our exports, as well as for the confidence of consumers at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/4">I want to say a little about the action that the Government and others have already taken since the horsemeat scandal broke at the beginning of last year. First, there has been robust testing of meat by industry and by the Government, with more than 50,000 tests of processed beef products carried out during that time, and I can say that no horsemeat was present in any of those 50,000 tests undertaken since the initial scandal at the beginning of last year. The Government have provided an additional &#163;2 million of funding to local authorities for food sampling in the current financial year to help them carry out that vital consumer protection role.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/5">We have commissioned additional sampling and testing for authenticity in response to intelligence that has been received. The hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire cited the example of lamb kebabs that did not contain as much lamb as they ought to have done. There has been comprehensive sampling of take-away meals to seek undeclared meat and undeclared allergens, which are another cause of concern. We have also instigated the development of new testing to ascertain provenance and country of origin, so that we can check that the country of origin that is stated on the label is correct and that those who claim that products come from the UK are being honest.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/6">Finally on testing, we are developing and road-testing a new method to detect undeclared offal in processed meat products. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40465" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">The hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> asked me what area we would look at next and where we think there might be additional problems. This is an area that we highlighted very early on. That is why we have been developing testing in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/7">At the end of last year, the FSA set up a new intelligence hub to collect, analyse and share information on emerging risks. We have also taken action to empower consumers to understand where their food comes from. That includes improved country of origin labelling requirements for products such as lamb and pork that have been set at an EU level, which take effect from April next year. The UK argued strongly for those changes. We are also improving the public procurement of food and catering services to provide schools and hospitals with high quality British food.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/8">A great deal has been done, but this debate has focused very much on the final report of Professor Christopher Elliot, which was published last Thursday. I want to say at the outset that the Government have accepted all Professor Elliott&#8217;s recommendations. As I</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/9">said earlier, many of them are already being implemented. We will be taking forward other improvements that were recommended by him to ensure that consumers have absolute confidence in the food that they buy. I think that there can be a universal consensus around the House about the key point that Professor Elliott made: the consumer must come first.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/10">Chief among Professor Elliott&#8217;s recommendations was the formation of a new food crime unit, based within the Food Standards Agency. That will build on the intelligence hub that was established in the FSA at the end of last year, but will add investigative powers. We have made a commitment to establish the unit and it will be fully operational by the end of the year. Initially, it will focus on building the intelligence and evidence picture of the risks and nature of food fraud in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/11">It is important to note that Professor Elliott made it clear both in his interim report and his final report that the incentives for organised crime to get involved in food fraud are high. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">The hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> highlighted that in his contribution. Although Professor Elliott stated that he was unable to find any credible evidence of serious organised criminals operating in this area in the UK, he highlighted the serious risk of that happening, given the incentives. The Government are not at all complacent about that. If there is any evidence of criminality in our food supply chains, we are determined to find it and fight it.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/12">A number of Members, including the hon. Member for Ogmore, highlighted the importance of whistleblowing. That is the subject of one of the main recommendations made by Professor Elliott. There is a concern that employees and others who have knowledge of food fraud do not feel that they have the right mechanism through which to alert people. The FSA has had a whistleblowing service, but it is fair to say that the awareness of it has not been sufficiently high. The FSA is looking seriously at steps that can be taken to increase people&#8217;s knowledge of the whistleblowing service. In addition, steps are being taken by the food industry to put in place similar measures to make it easier for whistleblowers to report wrongdoing.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/13">Linked to that issue is the need for better intelligence gathering and sharing across Government and the industry to improve our ability to protect consumers. As a number of hon. Members said, Professor Elliott spoke about the need for a safe haven for industry so that businesses can share intelligence in a way that does not compromise commercially sensitive information. The FSA has made a commitment to improve its systems for dealing with sensitive information and to facilitate the kind of intelligence sharing and analysis for which Professor Elliott called. We will work with the industry to facilitate its development of a safe haven to contribute to that intelligence-sharing process.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/14">A number of hon. Members, including the Chair of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" name="Anne McIntosh">the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh)</phrase>, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40608" name="Neil Parish">the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)</phrase>, talked about the importance of supply chain audits. That is another key theme throughout Professor Elliott&#8217;s report that we want to learn from. Professor Elliott highlighted the action that the food industry has already taken to assure the integrity of its supply chains and restore consumer confidence following the horsemeat fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/15">Professor Elliott made a number of key recommendations for the industry on that issue. First, he said that there should be a shift of emphasis towards the use of unannounced audits and the use of sampling as part of the audit process to act as a deterrent. My hon. Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton made the point powerfully that we need to have unannounced audits if the audits are to be meaningful.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/16">Secondly, Professor Elliott made an important point about duplication in the audit process. The hon. Member for Ogmore has talked about Government Members being negative about regulation. We believe in having regulation where it serves a purpose, but we should all share the hope that we can remove duplication. Professor Elliott made the point that a lot of retailers are doing similar audits, but with slight differences. There is a good case for the British Retail Consortium bringing its members together to review their audit standards and give consistency to their approach to audits so that there is a single industry audit system. He also called for the introduction of a new fraud module in the audit, which is incredibly important.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/17">We must recognise what the industry has done to restore confidence in the food supply chain. I commend the work that the Food and Drink Federation has done to introduce a guide to help its members protect themselves against the risk of food fraud. My hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton referred to that. Although a number of hon. Members, notably the former Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)</phrase>, highlighted concerns about the catering industry, it is important to note the good work that is being done by the British Hospitality Association to engage small catering businesses on good practice in food authenticity, and its work with Whitbread to develop an audit standard for larger food service businesses. He is right to highlight the concern and there might be further difficulties in making progress on that front, but we welcome the work that the industry has done.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/18">The shadow Minister spoke about the machinery of government. He asked why, after the interim report called for a change in the machinery of government, Professor Elliott seems to have stepped back slightly from that. Professor Elliott spells out the reason quite clearly on page 49, where he highlights the fact that representations were made to him regarding the machinery of government changes. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/19">&#8220;The review investigated this issue and was able to ascertain that the winding down of the FSA&#8217;s food authenticity programme was initiated prior to the machinery of government changes. While not attributing any blame for this decision, it was certainly not helpful&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/20">The final point he makes is that wherever the boundaries are drawn in the machinery of government, there will still be a need for different parts of the machinery to work together. That is why his ultimate conclusion is that wherever the boundaries are drawn, the most important priority is to have better co-ordination. That is exactly what we will deliver with the food crime unit.</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/21">The hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse spoke about the vital role of local authorities, and around 2,500 trading standards officers provide an important part of our field force in that area. As he knows, we have made available an extra &#163;2 million per year, and the Food Standards Agency runs training programmes for those 2,500 officers in the field. Local authorities</p>
	<p pid="a.726.2/22">have a legal responsibility to do that work under the Food Safety Act 1990, and a number of protocols and service agreements that the FSA has with local authorities set out exactly what is required, which is monitored centrally by the FSA. The hon. Gentleman is right to say that there could be a mixed picture, with some local authorities being better than others, but the FSA monitors them and holds them to their service agreements and requirements.</p>

	<p pid="a.730.0/1">In my exchange with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40538" name="David Heath">the hon. Member for Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)</phrase>, I accepted that this issue is not necessarily about extra funding, and it is certainly not about party political control because there are good and bad local authorities. The hon. Gentleman said he believed that the FSA had information about which local authorities were good and which could perform better. Is the Minister personally examining that in discussions with the FSA or with ministerial colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government? Getting those local authorities to raise their game, whatever the reason, is an objective that I am sure the Minister holds. Will he reassure the House that he is considering that issue?</p>

	<p pid="a.730.1/1">The FSA manages and monitors the work of local authorities, but one of Professor Elliott&#8217;s recommendations is that we should have a new committee on food integrity and food fraud. I will chair that committee, and it will be attended by my colleagues and a Minister from the Department of Health. We will discuss those issues and monitor the situation to which the hon. Gentleman alludes.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.1/2">Let me mention some of the other points that Members have raised. Sanctions were mentioned, and it is important to note that the maximum penalty is already 10 years. Sentences are ultimately a matter for the courts and the Ministry of Justice, but 10 years is quite a significant sentence. A number of Members asked why we have been so slow to get prosecutions, but as many will know, the City of London police are leading the investigation. There have been five arrests and two prosecutions, which are currently going through the courts. Hon. Members will understand that it is not appropriate for me to comment on ongoing legal cases, but we should recognise that the City of London police have faced challenges as they have had to engage with many different police forces across the European Union to bring prosecutions together, which has taken some time.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.1/3">My hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton raised the issue of labelling in the European Union. From April next year we will introduce improved country of origin labelling measures for pork, lamb and goat. In future&#8212;just as has been the case for beef for the last decade or so&#8212;pigs and sheep must be reared and slaughtered in the country that claims to be the country of origin. That is similar to the situation that pertains for beef production. On traceability, provisions have been in place for more than 12 years, and EC regulation 178/2002 requires all member states to establish a means of monitoring where the food has come from at every stage of production. That legal requirement is enforced by the FSA in this country and by other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.730.1/4">My hon. Friend made the good point&#8212;my hon. Friend the Member for York Outer also alluded to this&#8212;that however good the traceability and labelling</p>
	<p pid="a.730.1/5">systems in place, a long supply chain is not conducive to eliminating food fraud. It is important for retailers to look at their supply chains and try to shorten them. It is also encouraging that many consumers have taken more interest in where their food comes from, and we need both consumers and retailers to take a little more interest.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.731.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" speakername="Anne McIntosh" colnum="731"  time="020:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0003.htm#140908-0003.htm_spnew26">
	<p pid="a.731.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister for giving way because he did not have the chance to reply on this point last Thursday. Will the police have powers of arrest? We will not be rushed by future business, Madam Deputy Speaker. We need to know whether the police will have powers of arrest, and who will pick up the bill for the additional costs of the food crime unit.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.731.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40141" speakername="George Eustice" colnum="731"  time="020:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0003.htm#140908-0003.htm_spnew27">
	<p pid="a.731.1/1">The key point is that the new food crime unit will have investigative powers, and it is envisaged that people from the National Crime Agency in the police force will be seconded to that unit. As my hon. Friend knows, the police always have powers of arrest&#8212;indeed, they have arrested people in this current investigation. The new food crime unit will be properly linked to the police force so that it has those powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.731.1/2">Finally, let me turn to lab capacity. Professor Elliott raises a specific concern about whether there is consistency between existing private labs and their approach to testing. As a result, we accept his recommendation and have asked the analytical methods working group&#8212;an advisory panel to the Government&#8212;to consider that issue and ensure consistency. We had no lack of lab capacity in the crisis last year. In fact, our excellent laboratories at the Food and Environment Research Agency in York were on stand-by if they were needed, although in the event they were not. Private labs like LCG, which I will visit tomorrow, led on most of that work. My hon. Friend also mentioned the Danish model and expressed a view&#8212;perhaps because she has Danish roots&#8212;that it is better than the Dutch model. When it comes to the food crime unit, it is difficult to compare the Danish or the Dutch model with what we have in the UK because we have some 2,500 trading standards officers in local authorities, who are an integral part of our protection in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.731.1/3">It is perhaps fitting to conclude where the hon. Member for York Outer ended his remarks, and with Professor Elliott&#8217;s conclusion that we have some of the safest food in the world. I completely agree with him that we should protect the reputation of our hard-working farmers. The Government have introduced a new Government procurement plan which, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40500" name="Zac Goldsmith">the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith)</phrase> pointed out, will encourage greater sourcing of local food. We are also working to encourage more schools to take a greater interest in and promote food and an appreciation of food in the curriculum. I thank all hon. Members for their contributions to the discussion. We have covered many detailed issues, and I again congratulate the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire on securing the debate.</p>

	<p pid="a.731.2/1">I voiced a slight concern at the beginning of the debate that I thought the seriousness and importance of the subject might be compromised by the small number of hon. Members present, but that</p>
	<p pid="a.731.2/2">concern has been confounded by the quality of the contributions made.

	<p pid="a.731.2/3">Professor Elliott set out eight pillars for the work that needs to be done. Paramount are the quality and reputation of British food and the rights of the consumer. I am sure that the House, the House&#8217;s Committees and Committees in the other place will take an interest in how the Government deliver on their commitment to accept all the report&#8217;s recommendations.

	<p pid="a.734.2/1">We go from one important debate on a primary industry&#8212;farming&#8212;to another. I want to say a few words for the next short while on mining, a subject that gets too little attention in the UK. Like the shipping industry, we rely on mining for pretty much everything we use daily, but it is invisible to most of our constituents and most consumers. We do not mine that much in the UK, although it is still an important industry to an extent in parts of the country; we still have aggregates on the go and there is still quarrying, but mining is something that happens abroad. Like other primary industries, it can be more important in developing economies than it is in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/2">I want to emphasise the UK&#8217;s contribution to international mining, which primarily comes through trading in the City of London. Most large mining companies, or certainly many, choose to be listed in the UK for the prestige and the convenience, and because they can raise capital here, and many that are not primarily listed in the UK are present in a large way. The large mining companies are listed here&#8212;smaller ones are on the AIM, the alternative investment market&#8212;and UK industries such as financial and legal services service the mining industry. Arguably London, along with Toronto, is at the forefront of the international mining industry, but much like shipping, we often do not realise that, because most of the mining goes on abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/3">In developed states, the things that we think of and speak of most and that dominate our daily lives are the services that we consume&#8212;the constant flow of ever more astonishing inventions, technologies and concepts that make our lives easier, more fulfilling or, often, simply better. People&#8217;s creativity often seems boundless. That ability and instinct to improve design means that new, astonishing things appear almost daily. The acceleration of ideas and technologically intelligent advances seem to be on a near-constant upward convex curve.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/4">As an eight-year-old, I remember very well&#8212;I checked on Google to see whether it was a false memory&#8212;my dad getting me out of bed at 4 or 5 o&#8217;clock in the morning to watch Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landing on the moon. They played a bit of golf and turned the moon into a fairway for a brief period. That seemed like the apex of technological advancement for a very long time, but when we look back, we can see that technological advances have continued on a remarkable upward curve. The moon landing seems a very long time ago in technological terms. It is almost a bore to reflect on how things have changed. One thinks about computers in the period since then; the technology involved in that amazing scientific advance and historical event is very far behind where we are today.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/5">We tend to reflect on what affects our daily lives and our services at the expense of the primary industries that facilitate them. In fact, mining uses many technological advances. One sometimes makes a false dichotomy between complexity and cleverness and the services we use daily. We sometimes forget that the primary industries on which the service industries rely are very sophisticated.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/6">One reason why technology dominates our daily discourse is that we quickly adapt to new ideas, come to rely on them and want yet more. We adapt using our intelligence, and that is fabulous&#8212;we expect fabulous things and see them every day on the internet. The internet itself is a fabulous thing. Not everything that evolves through it is the best, but much of it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/7">I am not complaining about new technologies dominating our daily lives, but they often challenge us to think about what values lie at the heart of the way we live. We have to consider whether certain new developments are advantageous, such as the potential meeting of the internet, DNA and new insurance products. We have to decide whether to allow them to happen and to go with the flow. We have to make a value judgment: perhaps we will know more about our futures and our own likely means of death if we choose to allow such things. That might or might not be desirable, but technology makes us make such value judgments. I guess that that is why these things are often at the forefront of minds in the developed world.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/8">What is often at the forefront of people&#8217;s minds in the developing world is that the mining industry is potentially the only way of getting early money other than aid into the economy. Aid is very nice, but it is on a relatively small scale and can only ever be a sticking plaster. Often, the international mining industry comes along and has a transformative effect on the economy in the developing world, although not always. People talk about the resource curse, but we never think of calling oil and gas in Scotland a curse. We think, in a rather superior fashion, that it is okay if we have it, but that perhaps it is a curse to people in the developing world.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/9">Of course, the result is not simply a function of the mining industry. It is usually a function of local governance and the capacity of a country to benefit from the exploitation of its natural resources. Sometimes other variables have to be fixed. Expectations can be high, and mining is very capital-intensive&#8212;it takes many years before the money is won back in profits, which is when populations start to benefit. Another variable is that people are sometimes moved out of other necessary parts of the economy, such as agriculture, into mining; there is a drag factor that takes people away from essential parts of the economy, often primary industries themselves. However, there are places in the world where it has been got right&#8212;in Africa I think of Zambia, and elsewhere I think particularly of Brazil. In many places, developing economies are being pulled out of low income into middle income and potentially, in the future, even into high income. I think even of Rwanda, where mining is not a large industry but a significant one all the same and makes a very important contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/10">I wrote down a few ideas for this speech last week having spent a month in Cornwall, as I do every year. I was in a very beautiful part of Cornwall&#8212;I should say that I informed <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> that I was going to mention his constituency. I was staying in a cottage with my partner, and I looked out at what appears to be a memorial standing on the edge of a promontory, sticking out over a point where two seas join, which I discovered when I was down there is called Cape Cornwall. It is quite a remarkable sight&#8212;it looks like a memorial, but it is actually a chimney stack on the very edge of the promontory. Underneath the</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/11">chimney, out to sea in the cape itself, is a set of rocks called the Brisons, where the mining industry pulled tin out of the ground, as it did right across Cornwall, effectively starting the industrial revolution. Hayle, the local port, was involved right at the start of the industrial revolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/12">In due course, Cornwall&#8217;s mining industry had its time and then declined, which was largely to do with world tin prices. It was cheaper to extract it elsewhere in the world, and we became a different type of economy. As I said earlier, the service industry and new technologies came along, and other countries took over tin production. I will not bore the House with where tin extraction takes place now, but it is concentrated in a small number of countries, as is the extraction of things such as bauxite, which potentially will be concentrated in Guinea. That development is very much led by Rio Tinto, a UK company based and listed in London. The ground has already been broken for the initial infrastructure work, and when that development takes place, it will lead to the employment of thousands of people, and in many years to come&#8212;hopefully not too many years&#8217; time&#8212;that will lead to substantial tax receipts for a country that currently has very few. It will also lead to infrastructure, because a railway will need to be built to export the bauxite from the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/13">It is easy for us to forget the benefits of mining. I well understand why many good people I have known over the years through my involvement with the mining industry and the non-governmental organisations that are interested in it are often very negative. In this place, I hear more negative things being said about the international mining industry than I hear positive ones. To some degree, without wishing to be critical of people per se&#8212;certainly not Members of this House&#8212;there is a lack of awareness. Among our constituencies and our constituents, very few have a direct or immediate interest in this sort of mining&#8212;unlike with oil and gas&#8212;and their experience of mining is modest.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/14">My constituency is just outside a next-door-neighbour refinery, so everybody understands the oil and gas industry. Everybody in the UK consumes oil and gas, and everybody sticks petrol and diesel into their cars as well as use gas in their homes. In the end, while there is much discussion and debate about the consumption of energy, I think people get a balanced perspective. The NGOs and the environmental bodies will lobby for good reason and encourage us to consume less and look for other ways of fuelling our lives. People also understand that we rely heavily on fossil fuels as well&#8212;and will do for some time to come. I often think, however, that when it comes to the mining industry, the public understanding is not there.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/15">I am glad to see here on this occasion a Minister from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and not one from the Department for International Development. It tends to be the case that we view mining as an international development issue when it is, in fact, very much a BIS issue. It is about UK businesses, and UK-listed businesses generating revenue for the UK and for overseas states. It is about helping with all sorts of areas of technological training within the UK and in the United States, contributing tax dollars or tax pounds. It is something we hear very little of.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/16">People tend to hear the message that mining has had a chequered history. We all recognise and know about the many legacy issues throughout mining. For a period,</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/17">and particularly in Africa&#8212;I know this very well&#8212;many deals and sales of assets were made that were very dubious. Mining companies bought assets off middle men, and 20 years ago, many questions were asked about mining companies. Now things are really quite different. The mining industry, including very large operators, as well as middle-sized and small operators, are very aware of public scrutiny of what they do, and they have very high standards of governance. That is sometimes not reflected in this place. It sometimes seems very hard to get a balanced debate or a balanced sense of what the mining industry is about.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/18">When I engaged with the Government in the past, I tended to find myself having conversations with DFID. I understand why the matter will not be a top priority for all BIS Ministers, because this is not big industry as such for our constituents, but in the end, I think the UK is probably in the leading position when it comes to this industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/19">The Minister will probably be aware that I sit on the UK EITI&#8212;extractive industries transparency initiative&#8212;multi-stakeholder group. People might say that the UK does not need to sign up to the EITI. The initial concept was that it was for the developing world. Then Brazil and other countries such as India said, &#8220;If it is just for us, we are not going to sign up to it.&#8221; The UK sensibly decided to sign up, and we are going through the process now. So is the US, which is moving a bit faster, I suspect, because it has pretty much unlimited resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/20">At the same time, legislation involving transparency and accounting directives to which we are signing up has by and large gone through with the consent of the whole House and in the context of Europe. Britain has been at the forefront of those standards. In terms of who benefits, beneficial ownership from shares in large operators will pretty much be a feature of an open book as well. That is not to say, however, that the legacy issues do not exist. They certainly do, but sensible, well-governed mining operations need an opportunity to present their case to the public, so that we can understand the benefits, as many of the people they employ understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.734.2/21">I will conclude on that point. No doubt the Minister will have a number of things to say about the support that his Department gives the mining industry in the United Kingdom, but I wonder whether he would consider meeting me, along with representatives of the mining industry, to discuss what the Government and the industry can do together to give people a much clearer understanding of the benefits that the industry brings, in balance with the important nature of governance under the control of the NGOs that we all know and love.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-09-08a.737.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40652" speakername="Matthew Hancock" speakeroffice="The Minister for Business and Enterprise"  colnum="737"  time="020:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140908/debtext/140908-0003.htm#140908-0003.htm_spmin2">
	<p pid="a.737.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40255" name="Eric Joyce">the hon. Member for Falkirk (Eric Joyce)</phrase> on securing the second debate on this subject that he and I have enjoyed. I think that his approach&#8212;including his emphasis on the role of mining in helping developing economies to trade their way out of poverty and into prosperity&#8212;is precisely the same as the approach that the Government take. It should be borne in mind that without the extraction of minerals such as coltan from developing countries such as Ethiopia, Mozambique and Brazil, it would not have been possible for his mobile phone to ring at the start of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/2">That approach is telling and practical, as well as being the right approach and one that we have taken at national and international levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/3">The hon. Gentleman observed that some countries had used mining to take themselves out of poverty. He mentioned Rwanda, Zambia and Brazil, but it is also true that Botswana, which became an upper-middle-income country in 2007, was one of the world&#8217;s poorest countries when I visited it for the first time in 1996. Its success has been due largely to well-managed mining revenues from diamonds.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/4">The hon. Gentleman spoke about the transformative effects of mining, pointing out that in some parts of the world such transformations are not positive. The success of mineral exploitation is down to governance as much as to physical extraction, low bribery rates, and law and order. The problem of conflict diamonds, for instance, arises when law and order and governance break down. This country has experienced the benefits of mineral extraction under good governance. That began in Cornwall, and evidence of the tin mines still litters the peninsula, but it has also happened in the midlands and the north of England where coal has been extracted, and, of course, in Scotland. The potential boost to economic growth is strong, is recognised, and is due to good governance as much as to the minerals themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/5">We take a cross-Government approach, which includes the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and, of course, the Department for International Development. DFID has invested more than &#163;50 million in bilateral aid spending on support for trade structures&#8212;for instance, building trade capacity and promoting regional integration to help to ensure that the governance is in a good place. The hon. Gentleman rightly emphasised that trade can serve as one of the most powerful functions ever introduced to increase prosperity and remove countries from poverty, but, as has been demonstrated throughout the world&#8212;not least in China&#8212;DFID also has a role to play in strengthening institutions, and strengthening the structures and the governance under which trade operates. We know, from our experience over the past few decades, of the enormous benefits that that engagement under good governance can bring. Indeed, extractives companies are important partners for us in government, ensuring that we help developing countries to make the most of their riches when they find them under their soil in order to drive up growth. That is the approach we take.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/6">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the extractive industries transparency initiative. This is about progressing towards a common global standard of extractives transparency so that more citizens in poor countries share the benefits from natural resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/7">We are working with the World Bank, for instance in Mozambique, where we are investing in mining and gas sector reforms. We will support the Government of Mozambique to make sure that the laws on the ground are supportive, that operational standards are good, that health and safety is supported and that geological information systems are helpful. I pay tribute to the work that the hon. Gentleman has done as part of EITI.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/8">In May last year, the Prime Minister announced that the UK would sign up to the EITI. It is designed to build trust and dialogue between companies, civil society and industry. This is all about putting information into the public domain to promote public debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/9">I also want to pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40671" name="Robin Walker">the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker)</phrase>, who instigated the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee report into this area. This transparency is important, and many extractive companies are listed or headquartered in the UK and are supportive of EITI. That stakeholder engagement has been very beneficial. For example, Rio Tinto and Shell sit on the multi-stakeholder board. Furthermore, in taking forward the beneficial ownership rules&#8212;pushed by the Prime Minister internationally and in the small business Bill&#8212;and in abolishing bearer shares and increasing the accountability of international business, we are acting in support of the direction of travel that the EITI plays such an important role in encouraging.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/10">I note the presence of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40369" name="Michael Connarty">the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase>, who plays an important role in driving this agenda and helping to ensure that, through engagement and improving policy at a global level, mining and industrial development in developing countries can, through good governance, benefit the whole of those countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/11">I reiterate the Government&#8217;s support of the EITI multi-stakeholder group, of which the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40225" name="Jo Swinson">the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)</phrase>, is the Government representative. I acknowledge the rapid progress that has been made to date. The UK successfully submitted its candidacy application on <phrase class="date" code="2014-08-05">5 August</phrase> this year. That is a key milestone in taking EITI forward, and we look forward to the outcome in October of the next international board meeting. By signing up to EITI, we want Governments to know that EITI is not just for developing countries but that it is a global</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/12">standard, and we have a stronger argument to encourage emerging and developing countries to adopt similar rules if we have adopted them here at home.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/13">Finally, I want to reiterate the importance of the trust and transparency agenda more broadly. It matters in mineral extraction, but it also matters across the board: making sure we know who really owns and controls UK companies, which will help us to have a publicly accessible central registry of people with significant control; improving the transparency of corporate ownership; and making sure that the UK is a trusted place to do business and invest.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/14">The UK has a specific role to play in driving this agenda because of the number of global companies headquartered here, and because of London&#8217;s role as the pre-eminent global centre of international finance. Therefore, taking steps here in this House of Commons, such as allowing overseas conduct to be used as a basis for disqualification here in the UK and increasing the time limit within which proceedings can be brought following an insolvency, have an impact across the world in driving this agenda forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/15">I hope I have assured the hon. Gentleman that the Government recognise the important role of mining companies in developing economies, as well as the role of good, strong governance domestically and internationally in ensuring that bringing prosperity out of the ground through the extraction of minerals has a positive economic impact on the local economy, supports prosperity and ultimately supports what we are all here to do&#8212;namely, to improve the well-being of our citizens and other citizens around the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/16" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.737.0/17" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
