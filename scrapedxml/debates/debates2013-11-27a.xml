	<p pid="a.241.5/2">I have considered the proposals in the recent report by Amnesty, which covers devolved responsibilities in the main, but also covers some reserved matters relating to Northern Ireland&#8217;s past.

	<p pid="a.241.6/1">This morning I hosted the parliamentary launch of the report, which reinforces the need for a comprehensive mechanism to deal with the past, addressing justice, truth, recognition and support for the bereaved and the injured, and also reconciliation. What assurances can the Secretary of State give that the Government will support, co-operate with and properly resource any such comprehensive process emerging from the Haass talks, allowing the Police Service of Northern Ireland to focus its finite resources on policing the present, and, in particular, protecting our community from those&#8212;from both loyalist and republican sources&#8212;who wish to drag us back to the past?</p>

	<p pid="a.241.7/1">Let me take this opportunity to reiterate the calls made in Northern Ireland in the wake of recent attacks. There is determination that Northern Ireland will not be dragged back to its past, and there is universal condemnation of the disgraceful attacks that we have seen in recent days.</p>
	<p pid="a.241.7/2">The Government strongly support the Haass process. We welcomed its establishment, and we urged the Executive to examine the very divisive issues involved. We will, of course, consider the outcome of the process very seriously, and will give thought to what resources we can deploy to support it within the constraints of the budgets available to us.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.0/2">&#8220;there are longstanding allegations that Irish authorities turned a blind eye to arms smuggling across the border and to members of republican groups fleeing&#8212;after attacks had been carried out&#8212;back to the Republic of Ireland&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.242.0/3">Will my right hon. Friend raise that aspect of the report with the Irish authorities to ensure their full co-operation?</p>

	<p pid="a.242.1/1">I shall be happy to do so. Let me add, however, that the security co-operation between the police services north and south of the border has never been stronger. It is hugely important in combating the threat not just from dissident republicans, but from other criminals who seek to use the border to enhance their criminal activities. We continue to work with the authorities in the Republic of Ireland to establish how we can enhance our security co-operation with them.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.2/1">The Amnesty report contains a section on inquests. Has the Secretary of State been offered any explanation of why the Attorney-General in Northern Ireland, who has ordered the reopening of more than 40 historic inquests, now seems to believe that they should be abandoned?</p>

	<p pid="a.242.3/1">The Attorney-General&#8217;s remarks were patently made on his own behalf rather than that of the Northern Ireland Executive or the Government, and they received almost universal criticism. The Prime Minister has made clear that we have no plans to introduce an amnesty along the lines suggested by the Attorney-General&#8212;and yes, I acknowledge that there is a degree of contradiction between his actions and his comments in relation to inquests.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.4/1">Will the Secretary of State go a bit further and tell the House what action she is prepared to take to ensure that justice is done and seen to be done, rather than justice and the process of law being abandoned, which is what a senior law officer in Northern Ireland wants to happen?</p>

	<p pid="a.242.5/1">The Government are entirely committed to the integrity of the rule of law, and we will maintain our position. I think it important for the outcome of the Haass discussions also to abide by that principle, and to be consistent with maintaining the integrity of the rule of law.</p>

	<p pid="a.242.6/1">Does the Secretary of State agree that all the victims out there still need truth and justice, and, indeed, are entitled to truth and justice?

	<p pid="a.242.7/1">Let me take this opportunity to emphasise how important it is for victims to be at the centre of any proposals on dealing with the past. That was also emphasised during the Democratic Unionist party&#8217;s Opposition day debate. The allegations made in the &#8220;Panorama&#8221; programme have been referred to the police, and it is for the police to investigate them. I should stress that when the troops were operational in Northern Ireland they operated according to strict rules, and that</p>
	<p pid="a.242.7/2">the vast majority of the police and the Army officers who served there during the troubles were entirely courageous, supportive, and compliant with the rule of law.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.0/1">May I begin by associating myself with the Secretary of State&#8217;s comments about Father Alec Reid? On the Amnesty report, will the right hon. Lady go further in agreeing with me that the problem with last week&#8217;s proposals from Northern Ireland&#8217;s Attorney-General is that they would deliver neither truth nor justice, and that instead of healing the wounds of the past, they would cause them to fester even further?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-27a.243.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40169" speakername="Theresa Villiers" colnum="243"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#131127-0001.htm_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.243.1/1">The death of Father Alec Reid is a very sad loss. He played a key part in establishing the peace process, particularly in its early stages. As I have said, the Government have no plans to follow the advice of the Northern Ireland Attorney-General. I do not believe that it represents a viable solution to the past, and it received almost universal condemnation. As the hon. Gentleman suggests, it would result in significant problems, and many victims would feel real concern if people advocated that we follow that route.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.243.2/1">Will the Secretary of State assure us that she is working with the Irish Government to engage with all parties involved in the Haass talks to seek a comprehensive framework to address the past? Such a framework needs to deal with truth, justice and reconciliation in a meaningful and substantive way. Tinkering at the edges will be seen as a missed opportunity with potentially lasting consequences, and it is essential that the Secretary of State shows leadership at this crucial time.</p>

	<p pid="a.243.3/1">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that I am very supportive of the Haass process and very engaged with the Irish Government. I have had discussions with all the political parties on these crucial matters. I have also had a number of helpful discussions in the United States about how our American friends can continue their role of supporting Northern Ireland&#8217;s political leadership in the difficult decisions that it needs to make on the issues that are the subject of the Haass process.</p>

They both agree on the importance of delivering the commitments set out in their strategy document &#8220;Together: Building a United Community&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.0/1">We very much welcome the publication of the strategy. It was something that the UK Government had encouraged, and we worked with the First Minister and Deputy First Minister on it. When it is delivered, it will make a real difference to starting to heal the sectarian divisions that have been so divisive and corrosive and that can feed the scenes of disgraceful violence in Northern Ireland. The important challenge now is to ensure that the commitments in that strategy are delivered, and the Government will continue to encourage the Northern Ireland Executive to do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.244.1/1">If we are to achieve a shared future for Northern Ireland, it is important that the threat of terrorism should be addressed. Is the Secretary of State aware that the dissident republicans&#8217; failed mortar attack at Cullyhanna in South Armagh showed a level of sophistication and technological detail that had never been seen before in Northern Ireland but that has been recorded in Afghanistan and Pakistan? Perhaps that shows international terrorism links. Will she tell us what steps she is taking to eradicate the dissident republican threat in Northern Ireland?</p>

	<p pid="a.244.2/1">I have been briefed on that attack. It and all the others we have seen in recent weeks are a matter of grave concern. The sad fact is that the threat of terrorism from dissident republicans continues to be severe; it has been set at that level since 2009. That is why the Government remain absolutely vigilant and completely supportive of the PSNI and the extra visibility mechanisms that it is deploying in Belfast. We have deployed an extra &#163;200 million in funding to assist the PSNI and its partners in tackling this threat, and we will continue to give them every support.</p>

We are determined that there will be a legacy from successful events such as the city of culture and the G8 meeting.

	<p pid="a.248.5/1">The purpose of social housing is to help those who cannot afford their own housing, which I welcome. However, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman would like to discuss with his constituents and, indeed, the people of Northern Ireland whether the general taxpayer should pay for unnecessary housing for people who do not use it. That is why we are ending the spare room subsidy and that, I think, is supported by the people of Northern Ireland as well as the rest of the United Kingdom. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman might find that he is on the wrong side of the argument with his constituents.</p>

The winter fuel payment will be in place, as will the warm home discount, which helps 2 million people in our country. Last year&#8217;s increase in the pension of &#163;5.30 a week will be in place. Every excess death in the winter is a tragedy, and there were 31,000 last year. The right hon. Gentleman might care to recall that when he was energy Secretary there were 36,500.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.3/1">I asked the Prime Minister a very specific question: how are things going to be better this winter than last? The reality is that prices will be higher this winter than last. For the average household, the British Gas bill went up &#163;123 this week. It was also revealed that the profits of the energy companies were up 75% in the last year alone. Why, under his Government, is it acceptable for the British people to pay exorbitant prices to fund exorbitant profits?</p>

That number was lower last year. What is intellectually incoherent is to promise a price freeze for 20 months&#8217; time when we do not control the global price of gas&#8212;that is completely incoherent and a total con. When we are on the collapse of intellectual positions, more borrowing, more spending and more taxing are exactly the things that got us into this mess in the first place, and he remains committed to each and every one.</p>

For too long in our country people thought of dementia as a natural part of ageing, rather than what it is, which is a disease that we should be fighting with all the energy with which we are fighting heart disease and cancer. As part of the dementia challenge, we have said that we will double research funding over the lifetime of this Government from &#163;26 million to more than &#163;66 million a year in 2014-15.

	<p pid="a.261.2/2">Following reports of the incident, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office made representations to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation at senior level over the weekend of 23 and <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-24">24 November</phrase>, and the British Embassy in Madrid submitted a formal written protest to the Ministry on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-25">Monday 25 November</phrase>. In our protests we requested an urgent explanation of the incident from the Spanish Government, and sought assurances that there will be no further interference with the UK&#8217;s official correspondence. The unauthorised opening of UK official communications, including diplomatic bags, is a matter of grave concern and we made that clear to the Spanish Government. If the Spanish authorities had concerns about the contents of our bags, internationally accepted practice would require them to contact the British authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/3">We have now received an explanation from the Spanish Government and been assured that we will not see a repeat of those actions. As the Spanish authorities know, overriding international principles provide for both state immunity and the freedom of official communication between a state and its representatives. Tampering with the bags was a breach of the principles embodied in the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations. The UK strictly adheres to those principles, and expects other states to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.2/4">We are maintaining strong pressure on the Spanish Government to de-escalate current tensions and work with us to manage our differences through diplomatic and political routes. A major escalation could harm all parties, not least the many thousands of Spanish families who benefit, directly or indirectly, from the economic prosperity of Gibraltar. The UK wants to maintain a strong bilateral relationship with Spain across a range of policy areas, and such a relationship benefits the interests of this country, Gibraltar and Spain alike. We have reiterated to the Spanish Government the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s proposal of April 2012 for ad hoc talks involving all relevant parties, and there have been constructive discussions with the Spanish about these proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.261.3/1">I am grateful to the Minister of State for that response. As he said, the serious incident last Friday goes against the 1961 Vienna convention on</p>
	<p pid="a.261.3/2">diplomatic relations. Official correspondence and diplomatic bags should simply not be tampered with. Last time anything such as this happened was 13 years ago with the Zimbabwean regime of Robert Mugabe&#8212;not the best company to be associated with. This is the first time that an EU state or NATO ally has opened a UK diplomatic bag, violating the 1961 Vienna convention. That enormously serious breach comes on top of tedious and spiteful delays at the Gibraltar-Spanish border, and the incursion of a Spanish vessel into waters off Gibraltar. The deterioration of relations between the United Kingdom, Gibraltar and Spain serves nobody well.</p>
	<p pid="a.261.3/3">The Spanish ambassador was summoned to the Foreign Office last week but clearly that has not had the desired effect. Nobody wants a further escalation of events or further deterioration in relations, but at the same time Spain must be made to know that its actions are intolerable, unwarranted, and will be met with an appropriate response, defending the rights of the people of Gibraltar and respecting international conventions. What actions will Her Majesty&#8217;s Government take to ensure that once and for all Spain gets the message? Hands off the Rock!</p>

	<p pid="a.262.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40498" name="Nigel Evans">the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr Evans)</phrase> on securing the urgent question. I reiterate the Opposition&#8217;s growing concerns, and those on both sides of the House, about this latest event in a series of events around Gibraltar&#8217;s borders.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/2">We heard yesterday that two diplomatic bags were opened by Spanish police at the Gibraltarian border. It has been reported that the bags were taken from Gibraltar to Seville airport in Spain. As the Minister has rightly said, that represents a serious interference with the official correspondence of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government, and a serious breach of both the principles underlying the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations and the principles of state immunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/3">In the written statement before the House today, the Minister says he has received an explanation from the Spanish Government&#8212;he reiterated that just now. I am sure Members on both sides of the House would welcome hearing the specific details of that explanation, which were missing from the Minister&#8217;s written statement. Will he therefore set out the details of that explanation and say whether they came in writing? Will he agree to lay them before the House by placing them in the House of Commons Library? Will he also set out how long it took to receive the explanation from the Spanish Government once he had become aware of the incident? Will he be clear for the House on whether the British Government have a taken a view that the explanation was sufficient? If it was not sufficient, will he set out what further assurances the Government will seek from Spain on the matter, and how such incidents can be prevented from happening in future?</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/4">Will the Minister tell the House whether the Prime Minister has been in touch with his counterpart in Spain to discuss not just this matter but the series of recent incidents at the Gibraltarian border? Will the Minister also make it clear whether it is the British Government&#8217;s view that this was a case of Spanish officials locally failing to follow due process, or whether it was an intentional provocation authorised by the Spanish authorities?</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/5">Following the EU Commission&#8217;s observation mission to Gibraltar in September, from which it concluded that there was &#8220;no evidence&#8221; of Spain&#8217;s infringing rules of the border controls, will the Minster call on the Commission to carry out an urgent further mission and investigate any further incidents as they arise?</p>
	<p pid="a.262.1/6">Finally, it is vital that the Spanish Government today hear a united statement from the House that such provocative and unlawful acts are not acceptable to this Parliament or to the British people. They cannot be ignored.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.0/2">As I have said, we were alerted to the incident over the weekend, and we made representations to the most senior officials we could reach in Madrid over the weekend. We also ensured that the Spanish authorities at all levels were well aware of the gravity of our concern about the incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/3">The explanation that the Spanish have given to us&#8212;it arrived late yesterday&#8212;was that there was an error at junior operational level at the crossing point between Gibraltar and Spain, and that the more senior Spanish official present put a stop to that interference with our official correspondence as soon as he realised what was happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.263.0/4">As I have said, we have had assurance that such action will not be repeated. We trust that Spain will live fully up to its obligations under the Vienna conventions and international law.</p>

	<p pid="a.263.1/1">It is rather an easy explanation&#8212;is it not?&#8212;to say that the decision was taken at junior operational level. If I may say so, I think we are entitled to press the Spanish Government further on the protocol and the understanding of those who have responsibility for these matters at the border. The House will be united in condemnation of any breach of the Vienna convention. Have we had an unequivocal apology for the incident from the Spanish Government at the necessarily highest level, and an equally unequivocal assurance that steps will be taken to ensure that it never happens again?</p>

	<p pid="a.263.2/1">The protocol that should be observed, not simply at the border between Gibraltar and Spain but at any international crossing point, is that containers that are clearly marked as diplomatic and official correspondence are inviolate under the terms of the Vienna convention. It is true that, from time to time, people at operational level make mistakes. I trust that the Spanish authorities will now show, by their actions, that they will adhere fully to their international obligations.</p>

If this alleged error by a jobsworth was the only act of interference and aggression by the Spanish authorities on the frontier with Gibraltar, it might just get by, but it is part of a succession of harassment after harassment after harassment, and it will not do. The Government&#8217;s softly, softly approach is simply not working. May I put it to the Minister that if anything like this ever happens again, the Spanish ambassador should be expelled from this country?</p>

	<p pid="a.264.1/1">Clearly, any repetition, in the light of the weekend&#8217;s events, would be a matter of the utmost seriousness. The right hon. Gentleman decries the Government&#8217;s approach, but last week we had evidence that it worked in the case of the Spanish oceanographic survey vessel, which mounted an incursion into Gibraltar waters and sought to carry out survey work. Following the Government&#8217;s vigorous protests, including summoning the Spanish ambassador, and the strong views expressed in this House, notably in questions put to the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40103" name="Mark Simmonds">the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase> following his oral statement last week, the Spanish vessel pursued its survey work but did not mount any further incursion into British Gibraltar waters.

	<p pid="a.264.2/1">The Minister of State must surely now realise that this is a long series of acts of aggression by the Spanish Government against the loyal subjects of Gibraltar, and that the time has come to take firm and decisive action.

	<p pid="a.264.4/1">I endorse the strong criticism across the House of the serious breach of an international treaty in opening the bag, but may I probe the Minister&#8217;s diplomatic strategy to resolve the escalating tension of the past few months?

</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-27a.267.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="267"  time="012:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0001.htm#131127-0001.htm_spmin39">
	<p pid="a.267.2/1">In June 2005, the previous Government signed accession treaties with Romania and Bulgaria, and in doing so they granted all Romanians and Bulgarians the right to come to Britain. The treaties came into effect in 2007, and as a result the seven-year transitional controls relating to free movement will end on <phrase class="date" code="2014-01-01">1 January 2014</phrase>. From that date, Romanians and Bulgarians will have the right to largely unrestricted free movement across Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/2">Unlike the previous Government, who chose not to apply the transitional controls for countries such as Poland and Hungary in 2004, this Government are doing everything we can to ensure that we are prepared for this latest extension in EU free movement rights. First, we are making use of the full seven years available to us to impose transitional controls, something the Labour party failed to do in 2004, which meant that Britain was the only major economy in Europe to grant full access to its labour market to millions of Poles, Hungarians and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/3">Secondly, we are tightening the European immigration regulations to ensure that we do not gold-plate EU free movement rules. We are therefore amending the regulations to create a statutory presumption that a European&#8217;s right to reside here ends after six months unless they can prove that they are actively seeking work and stand a real chance of finding it.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/4">Thirdly, we are taking action to limit the pull factors that attract people to come to Britain. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is introducing a three-month delay before a European jobseeker can claim benefits and a new minimum earnings threshold to ensure that EU nationals are genuinely working in the UK before they can access benefits. He is also developing a tougher six-month test to assess whether benefit claimants have a genuine chance of finding work. That will apply to all EU nationals who come here to look for work and those who have already worked here. Those changes will come into effect as soon as possible in the new year. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health is ensuring that, wherever possible, the NHS claims back the cost of treating Europeans from their home country. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will issue new statutory guidance to ensure that local authorities set a residency requirement, or a minimum period of residence in a community, before a person qualifies for social housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/5">Fourthly, we are ensuring that there is a full and proper operational response to the challenges brought by that extension in free movement. We are working with the police, local authorities and other agencies to identify Europeans who are rough-sleeping and not exercising their treaty right to be in the UK. Where appropriate, those people will be removed. We are also changing the European immigration regulations to</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/6">introduce a 12-month bar on their return to Britain, unless they can prove that they have a proper reason to be here.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/7">Fifthly, I have lobbied other member states in the Council of Ministers about the abuse of free movement, and there is a growing coalition of support for change. In April this year, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands, along with Britain, wrote to the European presidency and the Commission to make the case for change. Although I am pleased that the European Commission has at long last admitted that there is a problem, it is still refusing to do anything meaningful about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.267.2/8">Those are the measures we are taking to prepare us for the extension of free movement in January, but in the long term there is much more we need to do. The Prime Minister made it clear at the beginning of the year that any future Government he leads will seek to renegotiate Britain&#8217;s relationship with the EU before we hold a referendum, and that referendum will ask the people whether we should be in or out. As I have made clear in the past and reiterate today, that renegotiation must address the problems caused by free movement. Now, in her reply, the shadow Home Secretary needs to tell the House whether she agrees with that renegotiation and referendum and whether she agrees that the renegotiation must address the problems caused by free movement.</p>

	<p pid="a.268.0/1">For generations, people have come to this country and worked hard to contribute to Britain, building some of our biggest businesses and even becoming Olympic medal winners, but the principle of contribution is an important one, and the controls on immigration must be fair to those who live here. That is why we called for stronger restrictions on benefits for new arrivals from the EU, including proposals eight months ago to strengthen the habitual residence test to make it clear that people should not be able to claim benefits when they first arrive. We also said that the framework for the free movement of labour should be looked at again.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/2">At the time, the Government dismissed those proposals, but eight months later they have changed their minds. That is welcome, but will the Home Secretary say why she did not bring those proposals forward at the time? It is now the end of November, and accession for Romania and Bulgaria will occur in a month&#8217;s time, so will she tell the House which of these measures will be in place by the beginning of January, when the transitional controls for Romania and Bulgaria end? Will the restrictions on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance be in by January? Will the housing benefit restrictions be in by January? Will the minimum wage fines be in place by January? If not, why not? We called for these proposals eight months ago, so why the delay?</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/3">We all agree that transitional arrangements should have been in place for the A8 countries. At the time, the Conservative party voted for A8 accession even without transitional arrangements. The Home Secretary&#8217;s party also supported the Romanian and Bulgarian accession agreement. The Prime Minister has today claimed that the rules on transitional controls should have been changed at that time, but he did not argue for changing transitional controls then and failed to do anything about changing transitional controls when this Government endorsed Croatian accession in 2011 with exactly the</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/4">same transitional control rules in place. Will she explain why the Prime Minister failed to act in 2011, given what he has said today?</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/5">Neither are the Government doing anything about the impact of accession on the workplace. Most people from Europe come to Britain to work, not to claim benefits, and 1 million British citizens live and work elsewhere in Europe too, yet there is a serious problem of low-skilled migrant workers being exploited, undercutting local workers and responsible businesses too. That is bad for everyone, yet she is doing nothing about it. We have urged her to take action, against recruitment agencies that target only foreign workers; against factories that segregate shifts by nationality; against the loophole in the minimum wage that means migrant workers are put into overcrowded tied accommodation to get round the rules; and against employers in the care sector, for example, who have recruited heavily from abroad but failed to train or to pay the minimum wage. Each time she has refused, so what is she or the Prime Minister doing to address those problems for wages and jobs? Nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.268.0/6">All parties should take a responsible approach to immigration. We will not enter an arms race of rhetoric. Instead, we need practical measures to address people&#8217;s concerns. We are glad that the Prime Minister has adopted our proposals on benefit restrictions, but the Government should not have delayed them for eight months so that they will not be in place for January. It is not enough, either. They need to take action over jobs and wages now.</p>

	<p pid="a.269.2/1">Despite all the evidence and warnings, the Labour party in government refused to impose transitional controls in 2004, but now it seeks to lecture us about immigration. I do not know whether the shadow Home Secretary has seen a copy of today&#8217;s <i>Daily Mail</i>, but it contains a fascinating article written by Britain&#8217;s ambassador in Warsaw in 2004, who describes the &#8220;incredulity&#8221; of the Poles when he told them that Britain would not be imposing transitional controls. He writes that the Polish Government</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/2">&#8220;instinctively knew what Tony Blair&#8217;s Labour government consistently denied: the immediate abolition of all border restrictions would lead to a surge of&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/3">their people coming to these shores.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/4">The Labour Government told us that only 13,000 people would come; the truth was that more than 1 million came. It was the biggest single influx this country has ever experienced, and who suffered as a result? The right hon. Lady talks about doing something</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/5">about wages and jobs. In the five years following Labour&#8217;s failure to impose transitional controls, more than 90% of the increase in employment in Britain was accounted for by foreign nationals. Under this Government, thanks to our measures to control immigration and reform welfare, two thirds of the increase in employment has been accounted for by British people.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/6">But if the right hon. Lady does not want to listen to me or the former British ambassador to Poland, perhaps she should listen to the succession of former Labour Home Secretaries who have admitted what the British people already knew. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40090" name="Jack Straw">The right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)</phrase> describes the failure to impose transitional controls as a &#8220;spectacular mistake&#8221;. And let us remember: it was not just European immigration that Labour let get out of control, but all forms of immigration. Under Labour, net immigration reached 2.2 million, which is twice the population of the city of Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/7">I come again to the right hon. Lady&#8217;s point about what is being done on wages and jobs. The Labour Government knew just what they were doing. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40195" name="Jon Cruddas">The hon. Member for Dagenham and Rainham (Jon Cruddas)</phrase>, the Leader of the Opposition&#8217;s policy guru, has said that Labour were</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/8">&#8220;using migration to introduce a covert 21st century incomes policy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/9">Labour, which claims to be the party of the working man and woman, admits that it used immigration deliberately to keep down wages.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/10">In answer to the right hon. Lady&#8217;s question, I have gone through what the Government are doing to prepare for January: we have been making full use of transitional controls; we are tightening the immigration rules so that we do not gold-plate EU free-movement rules; we are limiting the pull factors that attract people to Britain; we are ensuring a strong operational response to the challenges brought by free movement; and we are working with other member states to cut out the abuse of free movement. She claims we have done nothing about the habitual residency test, but my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has tightened it, and that is already in operation. We want to renegotiate our relationship with the EU and ensure we address the problems caused by free movement as part of that renegotiation.</p>
	<p pid="a.269.2/11">In its 13 years in government Labour did nothing about those issues. The shadow Home Secretary&#8217;s comments today show that she has not learned any lessons from 2004, has failed to come up with any solutions of her own and has failed to support our plan to fix the problems caused by free movement in the renegotiation. On this issue, as on others, she has no credibility whatsoever.</p>

	<p pid="a.270.0/1">My right hon. Friend rightly adverted to the fact that the previous Government, virtually alone among the major economies, allowed unfettered access to this country to the large populations of the accession countries in 2004. Will she assure me that this Government will not do what the previous Government further did, which was, at the same time, to grant a large number of work permits to workers from outside the EU, in a policy that has never been properly explained and remains mysterious to this day, even though it sounds very much as though <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" name="Yvette Cooper">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.271.0/1">Indeed, and a leading Labour party Front Bencher has already indicated that a Labour Government might consider increasing levels of immigration, were Labour to come back into power. Certainly this Government have been tightening up not just on the work permit route from outside the EU into the UK, but on every route of access into the UK. As the Conservative party committed to doing before the election and as was agreed in the coalition agreement, the Government have introduced a cap on non-EU economic migration into the UK. We have a limit on the number of people who can come here as tier 2 workers and we have reformed the other routes, and I am pleased to say that as a result we have seen immigration from outside the EU fall.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.1/1">Of course it is right for all Governments to target abuse of benefits. Will the Home Secretary reassure us, however, that this measure is not designed specifically to deal with Romanians and Bulgarians as the transition ends in just 30 days&#8217; time? Does she agree that the real issue is the push and pull factors? That is why it is necessary to work with the Romanian and Bulgarian Governments to find out the reasons and causes of this migration. Romania has not as yet accessed 87% of the funds it was given on accession. We need to work with the Romanians so that they can build on their infrastructure and their citizens are able to remain there&#8212;this applies to Bulgaria, too&#8212;which is what they want to do. We cannot have freedom of movement without movement, which makes this a fundamental issue for the European Union rather than one that can be dealt with by a change in the benefit rules.</p>

	<p pid="a.271.2/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his measured response and his question. Of course he is right to say that making the changes to tighten the benefit rules, seeking to remove people not exercising their treaty rights and then providing a year-long ban applies not only to Romanians and Bulgarians but to all those exercising their free movement rights and coming here from the European Union. What I took from the last part of the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question was, I think, support for the concept that this Government have set out&#8212;that we want to renegotiate the treaty. My party has certainly set that out, and the Prime Minister has set it out. We want the treaty to be renegotiated and, within that, we want to address the issue of free movement. Crucially, other member states across the EU are now working with us, because they also see potential problems arising from the abuse of the free movement right.</p>

We saw on the television young doctors in Bulgaria wishing to come to this country because they could earn in two days here what they earn in a month in Bulgaria. Is not their membership of the EU completely contradicted if all the talent leaves Bulgaria and comes to the UK and other advanced European countries? Even at this late stage, I invite my right hon.

	<p pid="a.272.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an important and serious point about people moving to the UK who would be of benefit to their own countries if they remained in them. It is important to look at the issue he raises about the disparity of wages and salaries that can be earned, particularly when looking at renegotiation, free movement and transitional controls. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has made it clear that one aspect that we are currently considering is whether a more flexible approach on transitional controls, reflecting potential disparities and extending transitional controls while certain disparities remained, would be more beneficial than the blunt instrument we have now.</p>

Most members of the public think that it is only fair when they are hard working and contributing to the NHS, for example, that other people coming here should be required to contribute as well, while those who come here legitimately think it only fair that those who are here illegitimately and illegally should be removed from this country.

What I think this country should do, in conjunction with other EU member states&#8212;and we are working with other member states&#8212;is decide what makes sense, and what is fair to our citizens.

Yes, if we do not open our borders to them the country will be taken to court, but we will have sent a signal of firm intent about our renegotiation of the EU treaties&#8212;and hopefully, by the time the case comes to court the referendum will have taken place, and we will have left this wretched organisation altogether.</p>

We are taking a number of steps to deal with that, not just in terms of what will happen after the end of the transitional controls but in the Immigration Bill, which is currently going through Parliament.

My private Member&#8217;s Bill, which has its Second Reading this Friday, would do exactly that, and by the end of a five-year extension, the referendum would have taken place. I urge my right hon.

With just a month or so to go, will she tell us what she has done to identify the agencies that are recruiting in that way and the employers that are offering those jobs? Will she also make it perfectly clear that the slightest breach of regulations on the minimum wage, health and safety, accommodation, benefits or anything else will be met with the full force of the law by the Government from the very first stage?

Other member states, such as Germany, the Netherlands and Austria, are also concerned about this issue of free movement and the problems that now arise with free movement. The European Commission is beginning to find that it is on the wrong side of the argument. It makes statements such as that one, but we will continue to impress on it that this issue is important for member states across the European Union&#8212;although of course this Government&#8217;s main concern is for people here in the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.281.1/1">Today I am pleased to announce that the Government are committing a further &#163;640 million in funding to the post office network for the three years 2015-16 to 2017-18. That enables the Post Office to complete its network transformation programme, and to protect and invest in those branches which provide vital services to their communities but are not commercially viable in their own right. In 2010 the Government committed &#163;1.34 billion to maintain a national post office network, modernise branches and safeguard the future of post offices that play a vital role in urban deprived and rural areas. Since then, the post office network has been at its most stable for more than 20 years, which is in stark contrast to the 7,000 closures that took place under the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/2">This Government remain fully committed to maintaining a network of at least 11,500 post offices, fully compliant with our access criteria and with a sustainable long-term future. To achieve that, the post office network must meet the changing needs of customers through longer opening hours and more modern premises which are easier and faster to use. Already more than 1,400 communities have benefited from Government investment into their post offices, with a total of 34,000 extra opening hours per week across the network. A further 830 post offices are also signed up to change to the new main or local operating models. In total, that represents nearly one in five of our post offices, and most hon. Members have one or more modernised branch in their constituencies. More than 200 hon. Members, including me, have personally opened a new-look post office in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/3">The Post Office is drawing on the experience from the first year of the network transformation programme to introduce changes that will see the programme completed by 2018. These changes, developed by the Post Office in conjunction with the National Federation of SubPostmasters, were endorsed yesterday by sub-postmasters at a special conference. We will deliver the benefits of longer opening hours and more modern premises to customers at a swifter pace, while making more investment available and providing greater clarity and certainty for sub-postmasters.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/4">The Government do not underestimate the challenges facing the network, the Post Office centrally and, in particular, individual sub-postmasters. In recent years, the retail environment on the high street, and more widely, has been far from easy for sub-postmasters. This new investment recognises that reality. The network needs to build on its core strengths of unparalleled national reach, and the trust and high regard in which it is rightly held by customers. It must focus on meeting customers&#8217; needs and expectations in a rapidly changing, highly competitive retail market. Ease of access, longer opening hours, shorter queues and modern premises are key to winning new clients and attracting and retaining customers. With more than 1,400 branches modernised to date, independent research is showing customer satisfaction levels with the new models averaging more than 95%. Satisfaction levels among sub-postmasters operating the new models are similarly impressive, at about 80%.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/5">In many locations, new operating models are enabling post offices to be re-established after a significant break in service. At Balnamore in north Antrim, a new local branch opened in August, re-establishing post office services some five years after the closure of the previous branch. The new branch opens seven days a week, for a total of 92 hours. At Oxenhope in west Yorkshire, which had had no post office since June 2011, a new local branch opened in the Co-op, and it now offers post office services from 7 am to 10 pm, seven days a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/6">However, this is not just about new post office operating models. The post office network is incredibly diverse, and it is just as important to customers in remote rural areas that their post office stays open as it is for busy town centre branches to be open for longer. There are about 3,000 post offices for which the new main or local models are not suitable. Those branches predominantly serve small, often remote, communities and they may be the last shop in the village. They are hugely valuable to their communities. The updated network transformation programme provides, for the first time in Post Office history, a &#163;20 million investment fund allocated specifically to that part of the network. The fund will enable the improvement and modernisation of those branches to strengthen their long-term sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/7">The investments being made by the Post Office are already creating a strong platform from which it can compete for new work from government and the private sector. Some customers and sub-postmasters have expressed understandable concerns about continued access to Post Office card accounts beyond 2015, when the current contract is due to expire. The Department for Work and Pensions and Post Office are in discussions about a long-term successor to the Post Office card account, and I can confirm today that all options under consideration conclude that access to pensions and benefits will continue beyond March 2015 across the whole post office network of at least 11,500 branches.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/8">The Post Office is also doing much more for government. Over the past two years, the Post Office has won every single government contract it has bid for. It is winning this work competitively, and winning it because it is such a strong partner for government. There is even more that the Post Office can do for government in the future. For example, under the existing contract with&#160;the passport office, the Post Office is discussing the introduction of&#160;new&#160;in-branch services which would allow the majority of customers to apply for their passports digitally, without the need for any supporting paper forms. The intention is to introduce those services&#160;from the middle of 2014. The Department of Energy and Climate Change recently announced that it will work with the Post Office to signpost elderly and vulnerable people to the 500 volunteers being trained by the big energy saving network to help people to find ways to cut their bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/9">Such innovations demonstrate a forward-thinking Post Office, which is introducing new services, growing new revenue streams and bringing new customers into post office branches. With the additional funding in place, we have the basis for building a thriving and sustainable Post Office. I believe that in the next few years we will see the Post Office continuing to grow its business, and its network flourish and potentially expand in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/10">Creating a financially sustainable network will be key to delivering a Post Office that can be mutualised.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/11">Significant progress has been made by the Post Office and its stakeholders already, and that will be boosted by the Government&#8217;s funding commitments today. The Post Office will shortly publish further details of the steps it is taking to build a mutual future.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/12">The &#163;640 million investment I am announcing funds the completion of a transformation programme. It establishes the platform for a vibrant, commercially sustainable post office network with a mutual future. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.283.0/1">I thank the Minister for her statement and for advance sight of it. Let me start by paying tribute to our sub-postmasters up and down the country. They are integral to all our local communities across our constituencies, and are indeed the social fabric of this country. However, the job of a sub-postmaster has become much more difficult in recent years. Research from the National Federation of SubPostmasters shows that incomes have fallen and many sub-postmasters work very hard, over very long hours, for very little return. That situation has not been assisted by the Government, who in 2010 announced plans to use post offices as the &#8220;front office for government&#8221;. The Government have failed to deliver on their pledge. No new major government services have been awarded to post offices since May 2010. The Minister says that the Post Office has won all that it has bid for, but these were contracts that it already had, and, according to the National Federation of SubPostmasters, many services do not make the Post Office any money at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/2">The situation resulted in the NFSP removing its support for the Postal Services Act 2011, because the Government promised &#163;466 million of government work but the Post Office is currently gaining only &#163;130 million from government business&#8212;that is 7% less than last year. That failure has resulted in the post office network being under more pressure than ever before. In addition to that is the abject failure of the network transformation programme to do what the Government planned. Consumer Futures wrote to the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee last month saying that of the 6,000 branches that were predicted by the Government to convert to the new model, only 1,100 have done so. That shows that the programme is not working, which is why a degree of compulsion has been introduced, with additional funding to deliver it.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/3">The Minister dresses up this statement as good news, but today&#8217;s announcement of an additional &#163;200 million on top of the &#163;440 million already trailed beyond 2015 means that we can firmly say that this is a vote of no confidence in what the Government are doing to the post office network. In effect, the Government are increasing the compensation for people to leave and providing more money to convert. Of that, &#163;23 million alone is for completing a retail survey to determine who should be converted or removed from the network on a compulsory basis. If the Government had delivered on their front office for government work that they promised back in 2010, the &#163;640 million would not be required. It is a payment for abject failure and for yet another broken Government promise.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/4">The National Federation of SubPostmasters voted to approve the package yesterday, because most operators</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/5">feel that the traditional post office model under this Government is not working. Sub-postmasters know that they face a degree of compulsion, but they will take the package as they are struggling on their incomes. The fact that members of the National Federation of SubPostmasters voted so wholeheartedly to support this package shows that they want out. It is the epitome of taking the money and running. Crucially, the money will be used to subsidise exit from the network rather than to go into the network to make it sustainable in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/6">I welcome the last shop in the village and community post office funding and support the fact that there will be no compulsion in that area. The &#163;20 million will assist in modernisation and help these critical community assets. Rural communities in particular need their post office services to survive.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/7">By the end of the process, the Government will have spent &#163;2 billion on network transformation, and there is a concern that we still do not have a model that is sufficiently attractive to current or future operators. If the model were attractive, it would not require additional funding, as the current programme would not be failing. Given that the National Federation of SubPostmasters has called the privatisation of Royal Mail a &#8220;reckless gamble&#8221; for the post office network, is it not the case that although the Minister is throwing as many sub-postmasters as she can into lifeboats, those lifeboats could already be sinking as retailers will not take on the local model? The Government are content not just with selling off the Royal Mail for a song but with hastening the demise of yet another cherished national institution.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/8">In answer to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">the hon. Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase> a few weeks ago, the Prime Minister said that</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/9">&#8220;we have committed that no post office will close in this Parliament.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2013-10-23.296"><i>Official Report</i>, 23 October 2013; Vol. 569, c. 296</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/10">If that is the case, post offices in which owners are paid to leave with no alternative in place are closing by stealth, showing that the Prime Minister&#8217;s claim is indeed hollow and shallow.</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/11">Let me ask the Minister a series of questions. First, will the current criteria be used for compulsion, or will it be updated? Secondly, will the new announcement require new state aid applications to the European Union? Thirdly, if a sub-postmaster stays and converts to a new model, they will have their salary subsidised until 2015, but what happens beyond that? Despite the fact that more than 1,000 sub-postmasters have said that they wish to leave the network voluntarily, only 94 retailers have been found to replace them in the past two years. What happens to the post office if other retailers are not prepared to take it on after a postmaster leaves the network on a compulsory basis?</p>
	<p pid="a.283.0/12">As shareholders get a significant financial benefit from a privatised Royal Mail, the taxpayer picks up a new &#163;650 million plan B for post office network transformation. It is clear that the Government have created chaos in our postal services, and that the era of Postman Pat and Mrs Goggins is well and truly over.</p>

	<p pid="a.284.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40240" name="Ian Murray">the hon. Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray)</phrase> for his contribution. I agreed with some parts of it. Of course we all join him in paying</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/2">tribute to the sub-postmasters who do such a fantastic job in all our constituencies up and down the country. I also agree that it has been a very difficult environment for sub-postmasters. However, small businesses and retailers have also found the past few years difficult. We could go over the argument that takes place in this House on a regular basis about where blame for that lies, but suffice it to say that we have seen a challenging set of economic times, and that has had an impact on the post offices, as it has on other businesses in the high street. However, the Post Office is a key partner of the front office for government, and it has won all the contracts that have come forward. Potential streams of income are coming down the track in the form of assisted digital services and identity verification. A whole range of different models are being explored, including those with local government. Indeed, a number of contracts have been won with various local government services, and there is probably more that can be done there, too. However, it is about not only the front office for government or mail, but having a diverse range of income streams for the post office. Financial services is one on which we have focused. For example, the roll out of the current account, which was piloted earlier this year in East Anglia, will be welcomed by many sub-postmasters, as it will provide regular transactions and regular footfall into post offices to give them the customer input they need to run thriving businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/3">I do not recognise the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s comments on network transformation. We are talking about a process in which more than 2,000 post offices are already signed up to convert to network transformation. I am sure that Members will report that customers have been positive about it, and the customer satisfaction statistics speak for themselves. Indeed, retailers in some of the new models, with the brighter and more modern environments, have experienced a 10% uplift in sales. This is about building a sustainable future. The hon. Gentleman tries to talk down the network transformation, but we should be talking it up.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/4">I make no apologies for providing welcome funding to sub-postmasters for participating in important surveys, which will also help to gather valuable management data across the network. We are dealing with a diverse and dispersed network of nearly 12,000 branches across the country. It is important to have that management data for the Post Office to work out how best to plan the network for the future. Ensuring that sub-postmasters are properly remunerated for undertaking those surveys is particularly helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/5">The hon. Gentleman asked a few questions about whether new state aid applications will be required. The answer is yes, but as the package runs from 2015, there is plenty of time to ensure that we get through that necessary process. On the payments that sub-postmasters will receive, he is right that there will be an enhanced package up until 2015 because we recognise that in making a change and a transition, new customer bases and income streams will have to be built up. It is important that sub-postmasters are helped and encouraged to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/6">The hon. Gentleman was wrong to say that we were subsidising the exit of sub-postmasters and leaving communities stranded without post offices. That would be taking a leaf out of the previous Government&#8217;s book. Under this plan and under this Government, that</p>
	<p pid="a.284.0/7">cannot happen. There cannot be a subsidised exit if there is not already alternative provision in that community. Importantly, communities have to be happy with the changes that are being made, and provision has to continue. In those circumstances, if some sub-postmasters want to leave the network and retire or perhaps take on a new challenge, then we will compensate them for doing so, as long as the service continues. That is the key difference between what the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s party did in government and what this coalition Government are doing. Labour closed 7,000 post offices. That was its answer to these particular challenges. We are creating a sustainable future for the post office network at a stable level. That is the difference between what they would have done and what we are doing.</p>

	<p pid="a.286.4/1">I broadly welcome the Minister&#8217;s announcement, which reflects the difficulties successive Governments have had in sustaining the sort of post office network we all want. The future of the network will depend, however, on the perception of sub-postmasters and would-be sub-postmasters of the long-term viability of the model.

	<p pid="a.286.5/1">I welcome that contribution and those words of welcome from the Chair of the Select Committee. He is right that this Government and previous Governments have faced the challenge of how a much-loved institution reforms and modernises for a very different retail environment from that of some decades ago. That is not necessarily always an easy process. He asks about the perception of the future viability of the network. The range of different services for which the Post Office can bid&#8212;not just Government services but the huge opportunities in the parcels market and financial services&#8212;are very significant. We must bear in mind the 10-year</p>
	<p pid="a.286.5/2">intra-business agreement between Royal Mail and the Post Office. The chief executive of the Royal Mail, Moya Greene, has said that it would be unthinkable for there not to be that commercial relationship between the two companies, so I hope that hon. Members will also respect that and not indulge in the scaremongering that has gone on in some corners about the future of the Post Office following Royal Mail privatisation.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.3/1">The hon. Lady is right that Government work is important for the Post Office. As the Minister responsible for the Post Office, I am engaged in promoting and encouraging that. Obviously, the Post Office must win work on its merits, and the environment is competitive. Whether we are talking about the mail market, the retail market or bidding for Government work, a range of competitors would be more than happy to take some of the contracts. It is a testament to the strength of the Post Office that, despite that strong competition, it has continued to win contract after contract, but I am in no doubt that bidding for that work on a more competitive basis creates significant pressures, particularly for some sub-postmasters.</p>

The points that they made about how post offices had often been seen as a safe haven where people from different communities could come together were incredibly moving. He makes a particularly important point about the service in areas that have seen such difficulties. The subsidy payment will depend on the specifics of which sub-postmasters bid for which money and how that breaks down, but I know that Northern Ireland has a higher than average proportion of rural offices, so I am sure that the community fund for community offices will be of particular interest to sub-postmasters there.</p>

	<p pid="a.289.2/1">I thank the Minister for her statement. With particular reference to Northern Ireland, where there have been bank branch closures, will she give assurances that she will have discussions with the major banks and her colleagues in the Treasury to ensure that banking services can be transferred to post offices, particularly in rural areas, to provide accessibility to services and, in so doing, sustain rural post offices?</p>

	<p pid="a.289.3/1">Absolutely. The hon. Lady is right to raise that issue. Of course it is very good news that 95% of the main UK bank accounts are now available through post offices; only Santander is so far holding out. But in the meeting that I had with sub-postmasters from Northern Ireland last week, they did mention that there were some specific Northern Ireland issues around the full range of banking services. I am more than happy to look into those and encourage banks to ensure that they are provided. Of course, there is also the new current account, which has been piloted and will be rolled out across the post office network. The post office should be an obvious place for people to undertake their banking transactions.</p>

Just this week, I received news from the Post Office that the Chandler&#8217;s Ford post office, in the Fryern Arcade part of my constituency, is to be modernised and moved with some of the funding that she announced today. The additional funding will obviously ensure that post offices remain, but can she assure the people I represent that communities that lost out and were so bitterly disappointed&#8212;such as Littleton village in my constituency&#8212;will have a chance for a glorious return of their post office services?

It is simply unsustainable to have 370 post offices out of a network of nearly 12,000 that lose &#163;37 million a year, as of the last financial year for which we have figures. We need to take action to get that Crown network to break even, given that these are offices, in city centre and town centre locations, that are busy places and should be able to at least break even, if not provide a profit to go back into the network. That is why we are looking at franchising proposals. We do need to get them right and they are the subject of consultation. I am not sure of the exact timetable of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s particular consultation process, but it is a six-week consultation for any suggested move. Where that is not right for the community, of course we should look again at different locations and ensure that a post office is continuing in all those areas that are up for franchising.</p>

	<p pid="a.291.2/1">We are modernising the post office network because we recognise that it cannot look the same in the future as it did 50 years ago. There have been a range of changes in the way that we live our lives and the way that people access financial services through bank accounts. For example, there is less demand for people to be paid at post offices. Those all have an impact on the services that post offices offer. That is why we need to diversify into a range of new services, and why the new models are often based on co-locating a post office with a thriving retail business, where they can mutually benefit, the post office driving footfall to help the retail business drive sales. In the new models, sales of the other retail businesses have increased. That is how we can build a sustainable future. We cannot set the post office in aspic as it was 50 years ago.</p>

At the same time, the old model of the post office with a sort of fortress that had to be built in, seemed outdated to many people, putting a barrier between the customer service assistant and the customer. It also added a huge amount of cost to the way in which the network was run. It is important that retailers and sub-postmasters providing services can take into account the needs of all their customers, and if the hon.

	<p pid="a.293.2/1">The numbers in the post office network are at their most stable for decades and, as I say, the facts speak for themselves on that point. On the issue of Government services, that is an important part of post office income, but it is not the only part, because that is not the way to achieve a secure future for post offices. They need a diverse range of income streams, including mails and financial services.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/2">As for where the Government work is, we have heard today that the post office card account, or its successor, will continue through the post office network, which is welcome. Last year, the Post Office competed for the framework contract for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and won, and that framework contract will allow further contracts to be put through, as indeed was the case with the UK Passport Service work earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.293.2/3">I am not for a second trying to suggest that things are easy for sub-postmasters. Things are not easy, and they have not been easy, in these difficult economic times. We recognise that, which is why we have enhanced the packages available to make them more attractive and make sure that sub-postmasters have more opportunity either to make the choice if they wish to leave the network or enable them to continue and invest in their business, get more customers through the door and build a thriving retail business.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.1/1">First, I would point out to the hon. Gentleman that he is talking about two entirely separate companies, because Royal Mail is separate from the Post Office. The privatisation of Royal Mail has, I understand, been discussed at length in the House and, indeed, this morning in the Select Committee on Business, Innovation and Skills, which took evidence from my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40524" name="Michael Fallon">the Member for Sevenoaks (Michael Fallon)</phrase>. I would gently say that making a judgment some short weeks after flotation is perhaps not the best way of judging a company&#8217;s long-term share price.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.2/1">As chair of the all-party group on post offices, may I tell the Minister that I warmly welcome the additional investment that she has announced? However, I think that there is an element of denial about what is going on out there. Perhaps she can share with the House how many post offices have been closed temporarily and how many are under temporary management? How much of the &#163;1.34 billion allocation has been spent on modernisation, and how much has been spent to provide an enhanced package for people to leave? Can she tell the House the value of the 10 contracts that have been won, and how many of them were new contracts, not contracts up for renewal?</p>

	<p pid="a.294.3/1">I shall endeavour to give a full answer to all those points but, if the House will forgive me, I shall write with all the details on those questions. As for temporary closures, I think it is about 400, but I can obtain the most up-to-date figures. As the hon. Gentleman can imagine, the figure fluctuates. I accept that it is important that we make sure that Government work is available as part of a mix of services and income streams that the Post Office can access. I absolutely accept that things are not easy, and I have said that a number of times when responding to questions this afternoon. I would not wish to suggest that it is an easy life being a sub-postmaster, because it is not, but we are trying to create a sustainable network for the future and, indeed, in communities that have experienced temporary closures, to look at what more we can do to make sure that post office services are delivered to those communities.</p>

	<p pid="a.294.4/1">The sad fact is that many post offices in rural areas continue to close and have been replaced by outreach services. The &#163;20 million investment fund is said to enable the improvement and modernisation of branches, but that is not the problem&#8212;it is postmasters&#8217; income in those branches. Is there anything in the statement that will allow the Post Office to give more direct subsidy to the income of postmasters in remote rural areas to stop the closure of those branches?</p>

	<p pid="a.295.0/1">We have to recognise that across a network of nearly 12,000 branches some post offices are not commercially sustainable by themselves, but none the less they play a huge social and economic role in their community. I believe that there will always be a role for continued Government subsidy for those branches. That said, we are using taxpayers&#8217; money, which must be spent judiciously. It is about making sure that those branches that can become viable without subsidy proceed without subsidy, but branches that require ongoing subsidy should have the certainty that that is the situation. At the moment, that is not the case, because those post offices do not know whether they are designated as community branches or whether they can access subsidies.</p>
	<p pid="a.295.0/2">That certainty will help, but as for the question whether we can increase the money for those branches on an ongoing revenue basis, that is not something which, in the current economic circumstances, I can promise to deliver for the hon. Gentleman. That said, investment in those branches is sometimes needed to ensure that they can become more sustainable, perhaps by improving the layout or structure of the office so that it can do more parcels work, for example. There could be ways to enhance income streams by using a bit of capital investment.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. May I seek your advice on a reply given by the Prime Minister in Prime Minister&#8217;s questions, as he may inadvertently have misled the House? When asked about the impact of the bedroom tax on disabled people, he told the House: &#8220;Obviously, what we have done is to exempt disabled people who need an extra room.&#8221; Leading charities claim in a letter to the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions today that there is &#8220;stark evidence&#8221; to the contrary.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.2/1">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that attempted point of order. The juxtaposition of the two lines of argument has been made perfectly clear from his first quotation and from his second, of which no more is needed for me to rule. My ruling is that it is not a matter for the Chair. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s concern, but it is a point of debate. Of course, all Members, including Ministers, are responsible for the accuracy of what they say in the House, and everyone will be conscious of that. The hon. Gentleman has made his point, it is on the record, and I trust that he is satisfied.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.3/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I draw your attention to remaining orders and notices in the Order Paper&#8212;future business item 40 on changes to <phrase class="standing-order" code="33">Standing Order No. 33</phrase>, as tabled by the Leader of the House and the Deputy Leader of the House. The Procedure Committee, which I chair, has been in discussion with the office of the Leader of the House, and we thought we had been in a fruitful discussion. The Leader of the House is promoting the proposal that there may be three amendments to the motion on the Queen&#8217;s Speech, and the Procedure Committee has advised that it should be four amendments, so there seems to be a point of disagreement on the matter. I seek your advice: is it not the established principle that it is the Procedure Committee in this House, not the Executive, that leads changes to Standing Orders?</p>

	<p pid="a.296.4/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point of order. He is substantively correct, as far as I am aware, on the latter front. Indeed, that point has been made to me in the past in other contexts by Ministers when they have thought it convenient to deploy that line of argument. I would always hope that Ministers would treat Committees of the House with courtesy. However, nothing disorderly within the rules of the House appears to have occurred and I do not think there is a point of order for the Chair. Those on the Treasury Bench will have heard what the Chair of the Procedure Committee&#8212;a very important Committee with a very illustrious Chair&#8212;has said, and we will leave it there for today.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.5/1">Further to that point of order, Mr Speaker. Would it be helpful if I were to release a letter that I received from the Clerks of this House which said, in effect, that there was no need for the Leader of the House to be helpful to you as the Chair, as you already had sufficient discretion as to how many subsequent amendments could be chosen on the day of the Queen&#8217;s Speech debates?</p>

He will judge whether or not he wishes to release the said letter. I think he can rest content with that emollient and non-committal response from me. He knows how to look after himself.

	<p pid="a.298.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for the early payment of winter fuel allowance to eligible persons whose residences are not connected to the mains gas grid and whose principal source of fuel is home fuel oil, liquid petroleum gas or propane gas; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/3">This is an issue that I have raised on numerous occasions, during the passage of energy Bills, in debate and by means of a private Member&#8217;s Bill, and it has had support across the House on other occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/4">I do not intend to speak on the general problem of fuel poverty, the details of which should be well known by Members in all parts of the House. I merely note that the percentage of households off the gas grid that are in fuel poverty is more than twice as high as those that are on the gas grid. I acknowledge that the present Government have taken some action in respect of off-gas grid consumers, including the establishment of the ministerial round table on heating oil and liquefied petroleum gas, which led to the Federation of Petroleum Suppliers&#8217; customer charter.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/5">My proposal will not end fuel poverty for off-grid consumers; nor does it seek to extend winter fuel payments to additional groups or to tread on the contentious subject of means-testing which concerns some Members. It does not attempt to tackle the many issues that surround the topic of off-grid energy, but it is tightly drawn to give some relief to a particularly vulnerable sector&#8212;those pensioners who are off the gas grid. I have many of these pensioners in my constituency and they face a number of particular problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/6">Like all forms of energy, the price of home fuel oil has rocketed in recent years, but there is clear evidence that the price of home fuel oil rises in the early autumn and stays high over the winter period. This year it has been somewhat skewed by the long cold spring, with prices staying stubbornly high over the spring before falling in the summer, but they are now rising again. The rise in prices affects all areas of the United Kingdom over the winter months. It is important to note that this is as much an issue for the rural areas of England, Wales and particularly Northern Ireland as it is for the rural areas of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/7">The House of Commons Library note that was produced for my Bill in the previous Session states:</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/8">&#8220;The average costs of heating and providing hot water for a typical three bedroom house with LPG have been estimated at around &#163;2,300 per year (based on April 2012 prices with a conventional boiler), heating oil is thought to cost around &#163;1,700 and gas around &#163;1,200.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/9">The figures may now have changed but the general point stands: the cost of heating an average home with propane or home fuel oil is higher than heating with mains gas. Not only that, but the costs are also rising much more sharply. It is also important to note that the main use of LPG and home fuel oil is for heating, so although those homes generally have electricity, they still face greater costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/10">Traditionally the Government have called for an extension of the mains gas grid as one way of tackling the problem, but realistically such schemes will help only</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/11">those homes where there is a gas mains nearby, although even then the costs can be very substantial. I have had cases in my constituency in urban areas where the quoted cost of connecting to the grid is thousands of pounds, even when the mains are relatively close by. In many rural and island areas, where the cost of connection would be enormous, there is absolutely no chance of that being done.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/12">The Government&#8217;s advice to switch does not work in a market where there is often a practical local monopoly on supplies. The problem in many rural areas is exacerbated by the fact that much of the housing is old and of a construction that makes it very difficult to install energy-saving measures, such as cavity wall insulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/13">Of course, these households will receive the same winter fuel allowances as pensioners on the gas grid, but the crucial difference is how the energy is delivered. Those who are on the gas grid will receive their winter fuel bill around the time that the winter fuel allowance is generally paid, and it therefore works well for them. Indeed, in the explanatory notes to the regulations that last amended the benefit, the previous Government said specifically:</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/14">&#8220;They are paid in a lump sum each winter to ensure that money is available when fuel bills arrive.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/15">This is clearly not the case for those off the gas grid. They face the difficulty that they have to pay for their LPG or home fuel oil up front at the beginning of winter, well before they have the benefit of the winter fuel allowance. Many find it difficult to do so and may not fill up the tank completely, leaving them having to do so, if they can afford it, in the depths of winter, which brings problems of its own in getting a supply through in bad weather. That has been a serious problem in many rural areas in past winters.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/16">The price of fuel is rising substantially as winter approaches, and even those suppliers who offer a fixed winter price will do so at a price higher than the summer price. My Bill suggests how we might tackle this problem. The current winter fuel allowances are paid as a result of regulations which specify a date by which pensioners must apply. It is worth noting that once they are on the system, they do not have to apply every year. Clause 1 seeks to vary the regulation to bring forward for those off the gas grid the qualifying date from late September to late July. Clause 2 seeks to bring forward the payment date for those off-gas grid to no later that <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-30">30 September</phrase> to allow them to buy a complete tank of gas prior to the winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/17">These proposals would ensure that money is available when fuel bills arrive, as the regulations put it. I have debated this with the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase> previously and, with the greatest respect to the hon. Gentleman, it seems to me that the</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/18">objections to the proposal are bureaucratic excuses. The first objection is that the payment would have to be paid to everyone earlier or other claimants may feel aggrieved at being denied early access. The whole point, however, is to tackle the problem of having to pay for energy up front. Other claimants will have access to the allowance when their quarterly bills become due. I reiterate the point made in the memo to the regulations that the payment was meant to be available when the bill arrives: for those who pay up front, the most appropriate way to achieve parity would be to make payment as close as possible to the time of the outlay, which is precisely what I am attempting to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/19">The second objection is that the Department would need to create a separate category of people who are off-grid, and that the situation of individuals could change from year to year. I recall the Minister giving us a rundown of his own situation&#8212;by buying a house, he subsequently became connected to the grid. That objection seems ludicrous, as the number of new connections would be low, and unlikely to be a major problem. As Members know, it is not unheard of for the Department to insist on claimants of other benefits notifying a change in circumstances, so I do not see the problem. A low number of claimants are likely to be affected in any event.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/20">Moving the date forward could result in some people losing out on the payment in the initial year. I accept that that could be a problem, but it is hardly insurmountable. As I said, it would be a problem only in the first year of each claim, since once applicants are on the system they do not have to apply each year but receive an allowance automatically. It would be possible, for example, to allow off-grid consumers who miss the earlier date to apply at the later date but be transferred to the earlier date for year 2, so avoiding any difficulties. If, on the other hand, the Government have real problems with an earlier date, we could keep the September date and simply allow payment to off-grid consumers at an earlier date from year 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/21">There is nothing revolutionary about this proposal, which simply seeks a very minor change to begin to address the problems of off-gas-grid consumers by targeting a particularly vulnerable group. With political will, none of the problems is insurmountable. I hope that the House will give support to this Bill and allow it to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="a.301.1/3">On Thursday next week the Chancellor of the Exchequer will address this House in his autumn statement. My hon. Friends will know that we have come to expect a tin ear from this Chancellor, who in last year&#8217;s autumn statement cut tax credits and child benefit in the face of millions of people struggling to make ends meet while sticking firmly by his decision to deliver a millionaires&#8217; tax cut for the richest 1%. This year, the time has surely come for the Chancellor to wake up to the chronic and unremitting cost of living crisis facing millions of households across the country. Never before have so many worked so hard for so little, working week after week only to find that their pay packet has shrunk in real terms and that they are unable to borrow as much as the month before, with wages failing to keep up with prices and the pound in their pocket diminishing in value as everyday costs&#8212;rent, the weekly shop, child care, and gas and electricity bills&#8212;get higher and higher.</p>

Members will have read in <i>The Independent</i> yesterday that profits were &#163;30 per household at the time of the general election, that they rose to &#163;53 per household in 2012 and that they are now expected to be &#163;105 per household this year, and yet the Government continually cower in trepidation of the big six gas and electricity corporations.</p>

May I encourage him to continue taking them, because every time he does so he utterly destroys the weak arguments made by Government Members? Does my hon. Friend recognise, like the 5,000 people who signed the &#8220;freeze that bill&#8221; petition in Chesterfield, that the Conservative party has nothing to say on energy prices because it is utterly beholden to the very energy companies that are impoverishing my constituents?</p>

	<p pid="a.305.4/1">My hon. Friend is correct. The Government are afraid of the energy companies. We are not yet sure why they are so afraid to stand up to the big six, but it is clear that the Chancellor&#8217;s solution of simply shifting &#163;100 or so off an energy bill and on to the taxes of all our constituents will not convince people that they have the answers. The switch is so obvious it can be seen it in the dark. It is a palliative that merely shunts the costs from a bill payer to a taxpayer. It fails to tackle the root cause of the problem, which, as my hon. Friend has said, is the excessive profiteering of the utility companies. Government Members are going to have to try a lot better than that next week.</p>

In Wales, however, where the Labour party runs the Welsh Government, there have been council tax increases of nearly 9% over recent years. That is a bill that can genuinely be frozen by politicians.

	<p pid="a.309.1/3">We now have a record-breaking trade deficit with the European Union of &#163;6 billion, which is a sign that the rebalancing of our economy has tilted in the wrong direction. The &#8220;Guinness Book of Records&#8221; is already familiar with the Prime Minister&#8217;s achievement in delivering the slowest ever, snail&#8217;s pace recovery out of an economic downturn since records began, taking Britain longer to claw our way back than after the great depression. That record-breaking performance is thanks to the drag anchor policies that have held back growth for the past three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.1/4">The record-breaking let-down on growth has of course led to the Prime Minister&#8217;s biggest failure of all&#8212;more borrowing than any peacetime Government in history. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor have added &#163;430 billion to our national debt in the three years since May 2010, which is more than the last Labour Government did in 13 years and more than any previous Government have done in peacetime. They are record-breaking borrowers, because no Government have ever neglected economic growth quite like this one.</p>

	<p pid="a.309.5/1">I will come to the Liberal Democrats in a moment. I am talking about the Conservative party.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.5/2">The Conservatives and the Prime Minister like to pretend that they understand the concerns of hard-working people. When they finally realise the strength of public opinion, they will grudgingly come up with a half-baked effort on energy bills, just as they finally caved in with a long overdue cap on payday loans. The trouble is that they just don&#8217;t get it, because their hearts aren&#8217;t in it. As with the action on payday loans and banking reform in this week alone, why does the Chancellor always have to be pushed into doing the right thing?</p>
	<p pid="a.309.5/3">The forces of moderation in the Conservative party&#8212;I am looking around desperately to see them; perhaps there are a couple of them here&#8212;complain that they are seen as the party of the rich and that voters do not trust their motives. Twenty-five of the dwindling number of those anxious Conservative Members of Parliament had a meeting with the Prime Minister to express their concerns, although that was before some of them announced that they were standing down from Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.309.5/4">The moderates&#8212;there is one opposite me&#8212;are right to worry, because the Prime Minister&#8217;s pretence that he represents the middle of British politics has finally stretched beyond belief, as time and again his true instincts shine through. In the lord mayor&#8217;s banquet speech a fortnight ago, the mask slipped as the Prime Minister proclaimed the need for permanent austerity and the shrinking of public investment in perpetuity. The true ideological intentions of the Conservatives are there for all to see. Perhaps that is why the party&#8217;s Free Enterprise Group published its plans&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.312.2/1">Does my hon. Friend realise that the reason why some of us worry about the proposals of the Free Enterprise Group is that they are all of a piece with what the Tories have done already, including a drop of &#163;35 a week in real wages in my constituency, the imposition of the bedroom tax on the poorest people and, contrary to what they say, increases in council tax for the poorest people? The reason why Tory Back Benchers worry about being seen as the party of the rich is that they are the party of the rich.</p>

	<p pid="a.312.4/1">I want to draw my remarks to a close, so I will not take any more interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.4/2">In a moment, my hon. Friends will be subjected to the Minister claiming that the Government alone are responsible for the long overdue return of economic growth. What he cannot grasp is that growth is appearing despite his policies, not because of them. As the Nobel prize-winning economist, Paul Krugman, said of the Government&#8217;s attitude just the other day,</p>
	<p pid="a.312.4/3">&#8220;It&#8217;s like hitting yourself over the head with a baseball bat for years. Then, you stop hitting yourself with the baseball bat and say, &#8216;See? I feel much better now&#8212;hitting myself with a baseball bat was clearly the right thing to do&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.312.4/4">That sums up their view perfectly. They do not understand that only the return of strong economic growth will tackle the deficit in any meaningful way. Three years on, they still have not cottoned on.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.4/5">The reason we have a cost of living crisis is that the historic connection between economic growth and household wealth has been severed. Even though it looks like we are finally seeing some growth in some parts of the economy, that growth is not being shared fairly. Indeed, GDP per capita remains flat. I pay tribute to the companies and households that have managed to keep it together despite the Chancellor&#8217;s inaction. What we need now is help for those who are trying to do their best&#8212;the people who never complain, who never say that they should be at the front of the queue, who go to work and who manage as best they can. Those people need real help with their energy bills and child care costs. They need us to tackle low pay and to freeze business rates for small firms.</p>
	<p pid="a.312.4/6">The challenge for the autumn statement is to take action now on the cost of living, not to use sleight of hand to pile more burdens on the taxpayer. We need long-term reforms that ensure that there is a balanced recovery that is built to last, not short-term, knee-jerk flip-flopping. We need fairness for the many, not tax cuts for the few. The Government are out of touch with the mood of the public&#8212;the wealthy elite are looking after the wealthy elite and are all in it together. They are timid in the face of excessive profiteering from big energy companies, while the rest get broken promises on the economy and the deficit from a Government who are lurching to the right and reverting to type. The British people cannot afford this Government any longer. Britain deserves better.</p>

Does that illustrate that we are rebalancing the economy towards manufacturing and engineering, which we definitely need to do? That is part of an economic plan to recover this country from the disastrous situation in which we found ourselves in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.316.1/2">In short, Labour left our country a lot poorer, and it still has not apologised for the damage it did, despite many opportunities, including this afternoon. The Labour Government destroyed the aspirations of millions of hard-working people up and down the country. Instead, Labour Members sneer over the Dispatch Box and oppose every single measure the Government take to clean up the mess they left behind.</p>

A moment ago&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Conservative Members should listen for a moment.

	<p pid="a.316.3/1">The hon. Gentleman needs to listen more closely to my remarks. He will be interested to know that unemployment increased by 104% in his constituency during Labour&#8217;s last term. The bail-outs and the other action the previous Government took did not help unemployment in his constituency but, thankfully, under this Government, unemployment there is down by 24%.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.3/2">It is good to remind ourselves that office and government are a privilege given to us by the people of the United Kingdom. We are the tenants; the British public are our landlord. The Labour party was the tenant who trashed the house. It is left to this Government to clean up its mess.</p>
	<p pid="a.316.3/3">We need to treat the public with the respect they deserve. We know that times are tough. Labour left our country a lot poorer, and families are feeling it. That is why we had to put in place a long-term, sustainable economic plan to fix things.</p>

Members will remember that the shadow Chancellor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" name="Edward Balls">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.317.1/2">Without a credible economic plan, we cannot have a plan for helping families with living standards challenges. Anyone, including the Labour party, can come up with a list of interventions, but they are completely meaningless and unsustainable if there is no long-term economic plan to back them up. Labour&#8217;s only plan is for more spending, more borrowing and more debt, which is exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="a.320.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will know that SME lending was hit from 2010 to 2011 because of Labour&#8217;s banking crisis. We had the deepest banking crisis and the largest bank bail-out the world has ever seen. What did he think the impact was going to be? He should welcome the Government&#8217;s action to help SME lending, including the funding for lending scheme, which has helped thousands of companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/2">The Opposition claim that economic growth is not felt by people across the UK and that living standards are falling. The truth is that the previous Labour Government left the country a lot poorer and, as a result, many hard-working families are finding it difficult. Our plan for the economy, the plan that has put our country on a path to prosperity, will help those families. What better way to increase standards of living than by making sure that as many Britons as possible can take home a steady wage at the end of each month? With more than 1.4 million private sector jobs created in the past three years&#8212;more private sector jobs created in three years of this Government than in 13 years of the previous Labour Government&#8212;we now have more people employed than at any other time in our history.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.1/3">We are also taking measures that help keep more cash in the pockets of hard-working people up and down the country, while economic confidence has helped to keep mortgage bills low. If mortgage rates rose by just 1%, the average mortgage bill would increase by about &#163;1,000 a year. We are also letting people keep more of their hard-earned income. Our increases in the personal allowance are worth &#163;700 each year to every average taxpayer&#8212;a tax cut for more than 25 million people&#8212;while 2.7 million people on low incomes have been taken out of income tax altogether.</p>

Sadly, in Labour-run Wales, council tax has risen by nearly 9% over recent years, in the same time as it has been nearly frozen here.

	<p pid="a.322.1/1">My hon. Friend has made his point very well, and the shadow Front-Bench team will have heard it. If they really cared about citizens in Wales, they would pressure their Government in Wales to take action on council tax.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/2">We are also making it easier for hard-working people to put some of their savings towards buying their own home. Our Help to Buy mortgage guarantee and equity loans are making home ownership a real possibility for aspiring people. Just one month since its launch, more than 2,000 people have put in offers for homes under the mortgage guarantee scheme. More than three quarters of the applicants were first-time buyers, many of them in their early 30s. Since the launch of the equity loan scheme in April, 92% of the 5,000 new homes built have been bought by first-time buyers. This is how we are helping to raise living standards: we create a business environment in which more people can go to work every day; we create a tax environment in which people can keep more of the money they earn every month; and we work with the banks so that every year more people can secure the dream of their own home.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/3">Our plans are improving living standards, but what is the Labour party&#8217;s solution? I am sure it will tell the public that the only way is up&#8212;and they would be right: under Labour, taxes would go up; mortgage rates would go up; inflation would go up; and unemployment would go up. That is what economic failure looks like.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.1/4">As I said at the outset, the shadow Minister needs to give the British public more credit. They are a lot smarter than he realises. They recognise that it was the Labour party that got the country into this mess, and that it will take time and difficult decisions to clear up that mess. We, the coalition Govt, have put our faith in the British public, and because of their hard work over the past three and a half years, jobs are being created at a record rate, the economy is growing faster than in any other developed country, and as Governor Carney said just last week, the recovery has finally taken hold. There was never going to be a magical short-term fix, but our sensible, sustainable economic strategy will raise living standards, so let us not lose ground on the progress we have made; let us not allow Labour to take Britain back towards economic ruin. I beg the House to oppose this motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.322.4/2">spending power of nearly &#163;1,700 a year&#8212;while more people are being given part-time hours or zero-hours contracts. That is not their choice, yet food and fuel prices continue to rise.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.4/3">People in my Makerfield constituency are &#8220;doing the right thing&#8221;: they are working or looking for work. For those looking for work, a quick glance at the universal jobmatch site will superficially show that many jobs are available after searching for retail jobs in Wigan. Let us look a bit deeper at these &#8220;jobs&#8221;, however. In the three pages I checked at random, 67 of the 75 jobs available were for self-employed catalogue distributors&#8212;jobs that the site stated it had been assured &#8220;may&#8221; enable people to earn a wage equivalent to the national minimum wage. Really? How many people have tried these jobs, paid up front for their catalogues&#8212;about &#163;150&#8212;and found that they consistently earned the national minimum wage after paying all their contributions? It certainly does not include the people who have been to my surgeries after trying these non-jobs and finding that they could make very little&#8212;not even enough to heat and eat.</p>
	<p pid="a.322.4/4">Domestic energy bills have risen by an eye-watering average of 37% over the last three years. In 2012-13, citizens advice bureaux received 92,000 inquiries about fuel debt alone, while Which? estimates that flaws in the market have left consumers paying &#163;3.9 billion over the odds since 2010. We intend to stand up for consumers in this failing market and break the stranglehold of the big six. What have this Government proposed? Nothing. It is no wonder that citizens advice bureaux saw a 78% increase in the number of people having to use food banks last year. Many of those people were in work, yet were unable to pay their bills and could not afford to eat.</p>

	<p pid="a.323.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for mentioning the unemployment figures in my constituency. I recently received an e-mail from the Audit Office telling me that the figures were not reliable because the constituency was a pilot area and people were coming off the register.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.1/2">Admitting that you cannot feed your family is not easy or comfortable. For many people, going to a food bank is a last resort and a source of shame, although it is not their fault but is due to an accumulation of Tory-led policies that are punishing, not rewarding, hard-working people.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.1/3">I would not be doing justice to my constituency postbag, or to the people who attend my surgeries, if I did not mention the economically unsound bedroom tax. As I have often said before, in Wigan we have a shortage of one and two-bedroom properties and a surplus of three-bedroom properties. People are being forced either to move to the more expensive private rented sector, uprooting their families and incurring further expense, or to pay the difference. Given that 4,200 people in my constituency are affected by reductions</p>
	<p pid="a.323.1/4">in housing benefit ranging from &#163;517 to &#163;1,273, it is no surprise that in October, 2,500 people contacted Wigan and Leigh Housing about rent arrears and debt. That represents an increase of 50% in the last three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.1/5">The bedroom tax means yet another cut in the available income of many of my constituents, forcing them to make stark choices about how they spend their money. Far from being a case of what luxury item they must do without, it is a case of &#8220;Can we afford to have the heating on, or should we shiver and buy food&#8212;and what about that new pair of school shoes? Heaven forbid that the washing machine or the fridge should break down!&#8221; There is certainly no money to save for a rainy day. In fact, many of my constituents are already swamped and drowning in debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.1/6">No wonder the payday lenders, the home credit providers, the log book loan companies and the rest are proliferating. According to a recent report, 48% of people who go to payday lenders are female, and the majority of females have borrowed for everyday necessities. They have borrowed to buy food for the family, or to pay the heating bills. Capping the cost of credit constitutes a welcome recognition that these companies are making profit from despair, but there is much more to be done. The root cause of rising prices and low incomes needs to be addressed if people are to be saved from being dragged into a spiral of debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.323.1/7">The people whom I represent are hard-working people who want the best for their families and who are doing the right thing, but they are being let down by this Tory-led Government in so many ways. Every time they go to the supermarket, every time they receive a fuel bill, and every time they turn on the television or walk down the high street and see more advertisements for payday lenders, they are reminded of the Government&#8217;s failure to address the issue that is most important to them: the cost of living.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.0/2">I am delighted that the Labour party has initiated this debate. I say to Labour Members &#8220;Bring it on!&#8221; I am glad that they have at last woken up to the cost-of-living crisis. While many of us were going on about it for a number of years, they were talking about predistributions or other &#8220;chattering classes&#8221; subjects that no one understood. While we were cutting and freezing fuel duty, cutting taxes and raising thresholds for lower earners, and increasing taxes for the rich by, for instance, increasing capital gains tax, they were voting against all those measures. They created a handout society, whereas we want to create a &#8220;hand back&#8221; society, and to give people back their own money through lower taxes. They created a society of dependency: a society of high tax, high debt and high borrowing.</p>

	<p pid="a.324.1/1">My hon. Friend is making a very passionate speech. I know that he feels strongly about these matters, and has campaigned strongly on them in the past. Does he agree that, although our hon. Friend the Financial Secretary made an outstanding speech, what was omitted from it was a reference to the importance</p>
	<p pid="a.324.1/2">of the employment allowances that will allow a first-time employer to take on a new employee, thus helping even more people into the workplace?</p>

	<p pid="a.325.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is another example of why we are the party of small business. Labour showed during its years in office that it was, as Peter Mandelson said, the party of the filthy rich and of big business, sucking up to bankers in the City&#8212;Fred the Shred, Flowers and all those kinds of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.0/2">The main elements of the cost of living are jobs, pay and energy. Let us look at the Labour Government&#8217;s record. They scrapped the 10p rate of tax under Gordon Brown in 2008. They talk about wages, but median wages stopped rising in 2003, in times of plenty, and hourly pay rose at only a quarter of the rate of economic growth. They increased fuel duty 12 times while in office, and the cost of bus travel increased by 59%. Council tax increased by 67%, and energy bills doubled. That is the record of the Labour party, which says that it wants to help with the cost of living. Sadly, it has nothing to show for it at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.0/3">Energy and fuel prices are among the key indicators of the cost of living. As we have heard from the Minister, this Government have cut fuel duty and said that they will freeze it for the lifetime of this Parliament&#8212;an historic move. Of course, I would like the Government to do more and to cut fuel duty further, and I hope that when economic conditions allow, that will be the No. 1 tax cut. We need to continue to help hard-pressed motorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.0/4">On energy, let us remember that there were about 17 energy companies under Labour; now, there are only six. Labour decreased competition, but we are doing things to increase it. I believe that the Government should do more on VAT, particularly through renegotiating our VAT rates with the European Union. They should also consider imposing windfall taxes&#8212;de facto fines&#8212;on some of the energy companies and passing the money back to the consumer. They should also cut Labour&#8217;s green taxes, which make up 17% of the average energy bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.325.1/1">My hon. Friend is making a powerful speech. I understand that Labour intends to make energy its focus in the forthcoming EU elections. I intervened on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase>, but he declined to answer my question. Does my hon. Friend agree that we should look not only at the six energy companies but at how we make energy in this country? We now need to import it, and we are over-reliant on expensive energy imports because the previous Government failed to replace the nuclear fleet in time. They did nothing during their 13 years, and that energy offering went down from 25% to 15%. That is why we now have to pay more for expensive oil and gas from abroad.</p>

	<p pid="a.325.2/1">As always, my hon. Friend hits the nail on the head. It is funny how we hear in the media that energy prices fell under <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40208" name="Edward Miliband">the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband)</phrase>, because they actually doubled during Labour&#8217;s time in office.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.2/2">There were 2.5 million people, including 1 million young people, unemployed when Labour left office. That did not happen over 18 months solely as a result of</p>
	<p pid="a.325.2/3">the recession; it was happening even in times of plenty. Under this Government, youth unemployment in my constituency has gone down by 7.6%, long-term unemployment by 4.3% and overall unemployment by 4.4% over the past 12 months. This is the Government who are helping with the cost of living and helping people to get back into work. I met a chap who was helping me with my car at Halfords, and he told me that he was going to vote Conservative for the first time in his life. When I asked him why, he said it was because the Conservatives helped people who work. That is what this party is all about. We are the party of hard-working people. We are the party that helps people with the cost of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.2/4">Pay and taxes are another indicator of the cost of living. There are 3,749 people in my constituency who have been taken out of tax altogether. They are on low earnings. A total of 36,861 lower earners have had a tax cut. I want the Government to do more, however. I want them to raise the threshold at which people pay national insurance, because that would make a huge difference. Let us take people on low earnings out of all tax altogether, not just out of income tax. Nevertheless, the Government have made huge progress, which has been opposed massively and has been voted against by the Labour party. We have to remind our constituents that Labour voted against people on lower earnings getting lower taxes. As I said, median wages stopped rising in 2003, so the previous Government&#8217;s record on wages is nothing to shout about. We need to improve the minimum wage; we should have a regional minimum wage top-up, on top of the national minimum wage. We need to reform national insurance as I have described, but at least this Government have started doing the things that are helping to address the cost of living most; we have taken action on energy, jobs and national insurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.325.2/5">A thing that gets my goat is that the Labour party claims to have the monopoly on compassion. As my constituents found out, the reality is that Labour had a monopoly on failure&#8212;on the cost of living, on taxes and on the economy. Through our history, the Conservative party has always been on the side of hard-working people; we have always helped lower earners. Despite the very difficult economic conditions that the Labour party left us, this Government have done everything possible. The Conservatives do not have a monopoly on compassion, but we are the party of aspiration. We give people ladders of opportunity; we give them skills and apprenticeships, the number of which has increased by more than 80% in my constituency. We are giving people jobs, and we are creating a new nation of property owners through the right to buy and the Help to Buy scheme. We recognise that the best way to help the poor and lower earners is not through the dependency culture and welfare society so beloved of Labour Members, but by cutting taxes, cutting fuel duty, freezing council tax, restoring the link between pensions and earnings, and helping hard-working people.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-27a.326.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" speakername="Stewart Hosie" colnum="326"  time="016:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#131127-0003.htm_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.326.0/1">I wish to say a little about the motion before I start my speech proper. The motion is in two parts, the first of which describes the failure of the Conservative Government&#8212;I intend to say most about that&#8212;and the second calls for action</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/2">to mitigate the cost of living crisis. Although the Scottish National party does not agree with the Labour party on the precise mechanism of its fuel price freeze&#8212;we would prefer to see a cut&#8212;the principle of taking action on fuel is important in tackling the cost of living, so we will certainly be able to support this tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/3">I wish to start by discussing tax, because that clearly has as much of a bearing on people&#8217;s ability to cope with rising prices as do earnings or the prices themselves. The Government are right to try to take as many people on low and modest wages out of tax as possible. The saving of &#163;595 a year for basic rate taxpayers through the change in the basic allowance from &#163;6,500 in 2010 to &#163;9,440 this year makes sense. However, a saving of &#163;595 for basic rate taxpayers makes rather less sense when the same Government are embarked on a &#163;40,000 tax give-away for millionaires.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/4">The people I really want to talk about are those in the middle, who are paying some of the heaviest price for the mistakes this Government have made. These people have seen the tax relief before they pay the 40% band fall from &#163;37,500 in 2010 to &#163;34,700 last year and to &#163;32,000 this year. So for every &#163;595 saved as a result of changes to the basic rate, they have had to shell out an extra &#163;2,000 at 40p in the pound. That does not make people better off; it exacerbates the crisis faced by people, particularly hard-working people on middle incomes. I am not talking about the very poorest and I am certainly not talking about the very wealthy; I am discussing those on genuinely middle incomes. It means that this Government have taken the number of people paying 40% tax to a whopping 4.3 million; whereas barely 5% of taxpayers did so 25 years ago, the figure has rocketed and 16% of all taxpayers now pay a 40% tax rate&#8212;even a quarter of a century ago this was a band only for the rich. They are not paying that because they are wealthier or even because the economy has come out of the austerity period. Indeed, people feel poorer because they are poorer.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/5">Last year, the Office for Budget Responsibility changed its forecast&#8212;I think this contradicts what the Minister said&#8212;by reducing household disposable income every year from 2013 onwards in the forecast period. In the March economic and fiscal outlook, it marked down real disposable income again to be negative or zero every year until 2017. People will not simply be not wealthier but will feel the burden of higher costs and stagnating real disposable income year after year after year of this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/6">It is no surprise that households should feel poorer given that since the Government came to power inflation has constantly exceeded targets, pay has been frozen and benefits have been cut. Even the calculation of pensions, notwithstanding the much-vaunted triple lock, has changed from the retail prices index to the consumer prices index. People need to understand that the actions of this Chancellor have caused untold damage to, and put pressure on, families throughout the UK, and much of that is because, as the motion says, he has failed to meet any of the economic targets that he set himself.</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/7">When the Government came to power in 2010, they told us that the current account deficit for this year would be a mere &#163;40 billion. This year, in the Budget, the Chancellor told that it would be &#163;84 billion, which is</p>
	<p pid="a.326.0/8">more than double the original figure. In 2010, the Chancellor told us that public sector net borrowing for this year would be barely &#163;60 billion. This year, he told us that it was &#163;108 billion, but when we add on the fiddled stuff with the pension funds, we find that it was actually &#163;120 billion&#8212;again, more than double the figure.</p>

	<p pid="a.328.1/1">I am suggesting that to try to remove the structural deficit and fail over a fixed time scale, taking no cognisance of external shocks, was a stupid thing to do and a daft economic and political decision, which the Government were warned about in advance. The warnings failed precisely because this Chancellor promised that national debt would peak at 85% of GDP on the treaty calculation, or at &#163;1.162 trillion on the normal calculation. However, we were then told this year that it would not peak until 2015-16 at over 100% of GDP on the treaty calculation, or at more than &#163;1.5 trillion on the normal calculation.</p>

	<p pid="a.328.2/1">There is a comparison here with what those on the Labour Front Bench are saying. The hon. Gentleman said his speech was in two halves, but his argument is in two halves. He has just said that he is upset that the Government are taxing people too much, and now he is complaining that targets have not been met. Will he at least join me in welcoming the IMF&#8217;s upgraded forecast, which suggests that for this year growth will move from 0.9% to 1.4%, and next year from 1.5% to 1.9%? That must be welcome news.</p>

	<p pid="a.328.3/1">I always welcome growth in the economy, but the error that the hon. Gentleman and his Government have made is that by increasing tax and cutting to the extent that they have&#8212;the ratio of cuts to tax increases is four to one&#8212;they will have sucked out of the economy by 2016-17 roughly &#163;155 billion a year.

	<p pid="a.328.5/1">I will not give way, because we only get two minutes&#8217; stoppage time, and I have had my two minutes.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.5/2">This Government are also borrowing more and we are all paying the cost of failure. The Government&#8217;s main failure is on the fiscal rules they set themselves: that the structural current account deficit should be in balance in the final year of a future five-year programme&#8212;it will not be; and that debt should be falling as a share of GDP by the end of that period&#8212;it is not. Both objectives, were, and remain, highly dependent on GDP growth, which, as we have noted in previous Budgets, is massively dependent, at least according to the OBR, on extraordinary unmet and unmeetable levels of business investment. Let us remember that in 2010 the Government suggested, with a straight face, that business investment would have to grow between 8% and 11% a year between 2011 and 2015. By the time of the OBR fiscal outlook in November 2011, growth in business investment had turned negative again and the forecast had to be changed to show future projections of growth of up to 12%.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.5/3">The Chancellor was at it again this year. Having failed to get the growth in business investment we needed, he is now suggesting growth in business investment of 8.6% in three out of the next four years. I hope that that happens, but based on the evidence we have seen so far and the inability of the banks to take their share in providing credit and liquidity to businesses, I fear that is a forlorn hope.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.5/4">We have also been told&#8212;this point was mentioned earlier&#8212;that we will see the benefits to GDP growth of exports from the UK. In 2011, however, we had a deficit in trade in goods of &#163;100 billion, which rose to &#163;110 billion the following year. The deficit in trade in goods has been sitting at about &#163;20 billion for every quarter of this year. The balance of goods and services was &#163;23 billion in the red in 2011, and that figure worsened to &#163;35 billion last year after four and a half years of depreciation in sterling. I would hope that at the very least the Government recognised that that part of the plan simply has not worked.</p>
	<p pid="a.328.5/5">I hope that the Government will be less stubborn about recognising where they have failed and that their optimistic Budgets have simply collapsed into dust when faced with the stark reality of austerity economics, which strips consumption out of the economy in the way I have described.</p>

They will do that for that year and every year, the equivalent of stripping consumption worth about 7.5% of GDP from the economy. Given that they have increased the ratio of discretionary consolidation to four to one&#8212;four cuts for every one tax rise&#8212;we can see where the Government&#8217;s priorities lie: not with jobs, not with growth, not with recovery and not with lifting the burden of the cost of living crisis off the backs of ordinary people, but with balancing the books on the backs of ordinary people in this country. If nothing else, they should recognise that it is not working. The pain is intense for communities throughout the UK and they should think again when we get to the autumn statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.330.2/4">&#8220;has finally taken hold.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.330.2/5">If I may, I would like to begin by highlighting some of the economic achievements of this Government since 2010. The Government have cut the budget deficit by a third. The Government have helped the private sector create 1.4 million new jobs, offsetting any jobs lost in the public sector by 3:1. The Government have ensured that borrowing costs have fallen to record lows, saving money for taxpayers, businesses and families alike. The Government have helped bring inflation down to 2.2% as of October 2013. That is important because of the damaging effect that rising prices can have on the cost of living. The Government have helped bring back growth to the UK economy, with growth now projected to be 2.9% by year end 2014. The Government have ensured that the UK has more men and more women in work than ever before. The Government have seen the number of people claiming unemployment benefit fall at the fastest rate since 1997. Indeed, in my constituency of Braintree, both unemployment and youth unemployment are down 20% in the past year alone.</p>

	<p pid="a.330.6/1">Furthermore, British manufacturing recently reported the strongest growth on record, exceeding that in every quarter since 1989, and Reuters recently reported that growth in UK services is the strongest in 16 years. The Government have indeed achieved much to rebalance our economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.6/2">Finally on economic performance, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40381" name="David Rutley">the Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley)</phrase> just mentioned, according to the OECD the UK has the fastest growth</p>
	<p pid="a.330.6/3">in the developed world, beating the US, Germany and Japan. So by almost every benchmark, the UK has made huge strides in turning around the UK economy, and the Chancellor and his team at the Treasury should be congratulated on sticking with plan A and ensuring that the UK is on the path to recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.6/4">The Government also have much to be proud of on the cost of living. The 2013 Budget raised the personal tax allowance to &#163;10,000 from April 2014. That ensured a tax cut for 25 million people, with individuals paying an average of &#163;705 less in income tax than they did in 2010. Indeed, 2.7 million people have been taken out of tax altogether, thereby reducing the cost of living.</p>

	<p pid="a.331.1/2">The Government have frozen fuel duty for the longest period in more than 20 years, with pump prices 13p per litre lower than when Labour was in power. Indeed, the average motorist will save at least &#163;170, the average van driver will save &#163;340 and the average haulier will save &#163;5,200 each year as a result, thereby reducing the cost of living.</p>

	<p pid="a.331.2/1">The hon.

	<p pid="a.331.5/1">I cannot give way; I have allowed the two interventions I am permitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.5/2">Furthermore, the Government froze council tax in 2013-14 for the third year in a row. The combined effect of the Government&#8217;s actions means that council tax bills, which doubled under the previous Government, have fallen by 9.5% since 2010, thereby again reducing the cost of living. The Government have increased child care support for low-income working families on universal credit, thereby reducing the cost of living. In 2011, child tax credit increased by &#163;225&#8212;the largest increase ever&#8212;and in April this year, it went up by 5.2%, a further increase of &#163;135, thereby reducing the cost of living. The Government introduced the triple lock, which means that pensions increase every year by price inflation, earnings growth or 2.5%, whichever is highest. Over the</p>
	<p pid="a.331.5/3">course of their retirement, the average pensioner will be about &#163;12,000 better off under the triple lock, which helps with the cost of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.5/4">Furthermore, the Government introduced the warm home discount scheme, which gives pensioners a &#163;120 rebate on their electricity bill, thereby reducing the cost of living. The Government have increased cold weather payments permanently from a measly &#163;8.50 under the previous Government to &#163;25, thereby reducing the cost of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.331.5/5">In conclusion, the Government have much to be proud of. The Chancellor made some difficult decisions in 2010 to ensure that the country could have a long-term sustainable economic recovery. As the Governor of the Bank of England reiterated in the Treasury Committee yesterday, the economic recovery has finally taken hold. We should not jeopardise all this by returning to Labour&#8217;s tax and spend policies, which created the financial mess that we have finally begun to clear up. The Government must stick with their long-term economic plan, as that is the only sustainable way to raise living standards. I therefore oppose the motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.332.0/2">Last month, the Office for National Statistics confirmed that the north-east had the highest regional unemployment rate in 2013. It said that the unemployment rate in the region was the highest in the UK at 10.3% in the second quarter of 2013, compared with 7.8% for the UK. The employment rate stood at 66.5%, lower than the UK rate of 71.5% for the same period. Almost a fifth of children in the north-east lived in workless households in the second quarter of 2013. At 18.7%, that was the highest proportion in the regions, compared with an average of 13.6% for England.</p>

	<p pid="a.332.2/1">I do not know where the hon. Gentleman got his figures, because I looked at the drop in unemployment and the numbers for youth unemployment in Durham showed a reduction of 19 in the last quarter. Although we welcome any increase in employment, he must pay attention to the quality of jobs that have been created. In Durham, a lot of people have lost good, stable, well-paid jobs in the public sector, and have taken insecure, low-paid, zero-hours-contract jobs in the private sector, if any employment at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.332.2/2">As I was saying, the Government&#8217;s failure on living standards is impacting on people in the north-east. I shall go briefly through some of the issues that we are facing. With the current cost of living crisis, people are</p>
	<p pid="a.332.2/3">working longer hours for lower incomes, and despite being in work, many people find themselves in poverty. Government Members seem unable to grasp that.</p>

	<p pid="a.333.0/1">As a fellow north-east MP, does my hon.

	<p pid="a.333.3/1">I am sorry, but I will run out of time if I give way. I apologise to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/2">The north-east has the highest proportion of people paid below the living wage&#8212;32% of workers are paid less&#8212;and research published by the Resolution Foundation has further confirmed that the north-east was the region where workers were most likely to be trapped in low earnings. The Office for National Statistics said:</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/3">&#8220;In April 2012, median gross weekly earnings for full-time adult employees in the North East were &#163;455, joint lowest with Wales and lower than the UK median of &#163;506.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/4">So people in the area that I represent are having to contend with lower wages, but they are also having to deal with rising prices. They are being burdened with not only increasing energy costs, but increasing costs for child care, for example. Energy prices have angered people throughout the country and all we have heard from the Government is excuses for the actions of the big six. When npower recently announced an eye-watering rise in electricity costs of 9.3% and in gas of 11.1%, <i>The Journal</i>, our local newspaper, reported that Dorothy Bowman, a campaigner for elderly people from County Durham, said that the price hike would leave householders with a stark choice. She said:</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/5">&#8220;They will have to choose food or heat, it will be too expensive for both. This is at the wrong time for people&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/6">She went on to say that npower did not care at all</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/7">&#8220;about their customers and the dire misery they are subjecting them to, they just care about their profits. If they were going to do this why not do it in spring, now people have no choice.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/8">She said the elderly would suffer, but so would young families living on a tight budget. I think she makes the point very strongly indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/9">In addition, <i>The Journal</i> reported on <phrase class="date" code="2013-10-25">25 October</phrase> that an official at thinkmoney said:</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/10">&#8220;Regionally, problems with utility bills appear most severe in Northern Ireland, London and the North East.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.333.3/11">That is why we need Labour&#8217;s energy price freeze and long-term reforms to the energy market.</p>

	<p pid="a.334.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an excellent point and I hope to be able to come to some of those issues myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/2">On child care, the cost of nursery places has risen by 30%&#8212;five times faster than pay for people on average wages. I opened a new nursery in my constituency a couple of weeks ago&#8212;Do Re Mi nursery&#8212;but without action from the Government many families will not able to take up places there. It is not good enough for Government Members to say that there is help for people and that there is universal credit. No one is on that at present and many are not getting any help with child care.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" name="Jim Shannon">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase> said, there are huge problems with debt. The charity StepChange in my constituency said that almost 2,000 people in the Durham area had been referred to it with debt problems from January to June this year. R3, the insolvency trade body in the north-east, found that almost a quarter of survey respondents were extremely worried or very worried about their debts, while 56% were worried about their credit card payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/4">For some time, Labour Members have been raising issues about payday lenders and the extortionate rates of interest they have been charging. We obviously welcome the Government&#8217;s announcement on this, but as yet there has been absolutely no information about what will be in place to help people who have already taken out loans that they are unable to pay back. That situation is seriously compounding the problems that many families are facing.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/5">Moreover, food poverty is increasing in Durham. The website of Durham food bank states:</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/6">&#8220;Durham foodbank has now completed two years of distributing food to local people in crisis. In our first year we fed 3686 people, our second year total is now in excess of 10,600.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/7">It thanks the army of volunteers who are helping it to meet this need, but makes the point, as I do, that that demonstrates a huge increase in the number of people requiring food banks. Indeed, the local citizens advice bureau has reported a 78% increase in the number of inquiries about the use of food banks. This flies in the face of the Government&#8217;s claims that they are turning the corner. Lots and lots of families in my constituency have a genuine cost of living crisis, and things are getting worse for them because of increasing prices and, at best, flatlining wages. They simply cannot afford to make ends meet.</p>
	<p pid="a.334.1/8">Labour is calling for the Government to take real action to make a difference to families in Durham and across the country. We want a list of measures to be included in the autumn statement, including an energy price freeze, an extension of free child care, action to boost long-term housing supply, and a compulsory jobs guarantee&#8212;real action that would help people who are struggling out there in our communities. The Government are standing by and doing nothing to tackle the serious</p>

	<p pid="a.335.0/1">I am grateful to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this important debate. We have had such debates on a number of occasions, but it is important that we have this one now, when the economy is growing. All the indicators from the IMF, the OECD and other estimable bodies suggest that the worst is over in the British economy and that we are encountering some sort of recovery.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/2">More important than recovery in itself is understanding how we got into this position in the first place. The economy will be a very important issue in the next election. I was interested to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> criticise the Chancellor and the Government for not reducing the deficit fast enough. When I asked what his solution was to this conundrum&#8212;whether he wanted to borrow more&#8212;he failed to answer. I still do not know what his answer is; perhaps he will care to enlighten us in the course of my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.0/3">It is true that the UK economy has faced a difficult few years given our reliance on financial services and, more importantly, the appalling fiscal legacy of the previous Labour Government. It was insane for them to borrow money in every fiscal year from 2001, even when the economy was growing. I have never heard of an economy growing at 3% while running a deficit of 3% of GDP. Not even Lord Keynes would have advocated such a policy. Yet we lived through a period in which we had year after year of deficit even when the economy was growing.</p>

	<p pid="a.335.2/1">That is absolutely right. I was as shocked and appalled as my hon. Friend that, when I asked the shadow Chief Secretary what the absolute level of the British deficit is&#8212;it was a very simple, general knowledge-type question&#8212;he did not seem to know. I then asked him whether he knew what the deficit-to-GDP ratio is, but he flannelled away that supplementary question and did not even pay me the courtesy of answering it.</p>
	<p pid="a.335.2/2">We have to look very carefully at the legacy of the previous Labour Government, because it has a direct impact on living costs and this cost of living debate. People in Britain&#8212;people in my constituency and, I am sure, in other constituencies across the country&#8212;intuitively understand that after a period of excessive spending in which, to borrow a metaphor, the national credit card went way beyond its limit, it is necessary to have a period in which spending is reduced. Nearly everyone understands that and, as a consequence, any poll that Members may care to look at shows that the Government and coalition parties have a considerably better rating on the issue than that of the Labour party.</p>

	<p pid="a.336.3/1">People in this country understand that any Government who came in after the 2010 election, amid the appalling wreckage of the economy bequeathed to us by the previous Government, would face a difficult proposition and have a difficult time. In fact, the previous Chancellor of the Exchequer, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>, outlined a plan&#8212;the newspapers dubbed it the Darling plan&#8212;that advocated spending cuts and a 22% rate of VAT. As Members will know, I advocated a much lower rate. The Darling plan was an adult, mature recognition of the appalling legacies that his Government had given us. It recognised that we needed to reduce spending and that what was then dubbed austerity was absolutely necessary for this country&#8217;s financial future.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.3/2">Despite Labour&#8217;s worst predictions, the Government&#8217;s plan is now beginning to work. We have not heard anything about plan B for several months. We have not heard anyone say, &#8220;Too far, too fast.&#8221; One esteemed Labour economist said that unemployment would hit 5 million, but none of those dire predictions actually happened. Labour persists, however, in peddling the socialist, never-never land idea that borrowing more money will somehow reduce the deficit. That is absolutely insane. I understand why <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">the hon.

	<p pid="a.336.5/1">No, I will not. I tried to intervene on the hon. Gentleman, but he quite rightly wanted to use his full allocation of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.5/2">What do the Opposition actually propose? They have no plans on the economy. Their economic credibility is severely questioned by the British public. All their prophecies and predictions have proved to be completely false.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.5/3">They are now left with the notion that the Government have somehow failed and that the very difficult time through which we have passed is a direct consequence of Government policies, when it has in fact been the direct consequence of the Government trying to get us out of the mess bequeathed by the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.5/4">Let us look at the Darling plan. When the Labour Chancellor was in government, he said that spending would have to be reduced, which is exactly what this Government have done and achieved. As I have mentioned, under the Darling plan the VAT rate would be 22%. It is lower than that, so we have managed to achieve a degree of fiscal consolidation without some of the punitive tax rates suggested by the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.5/5">All of this debate has a direct bearing on living standards and the difficulties that people are facing. Once again, under difficult fiscal constraints, this Government have managed to lift hundreds of thousands of people out of tax altogether. They have raised the personal allowance, which is a significant achievement in a time of relative austerity when we have not had the largesse that the previous Government enjoyed and abused. It is absolutely to the Government&#8217;s credit that we have managed to raise the personal allowance&#8212;taking people out of tax&#8212;which has alleviated living conditions and made them slightly easier for many of the poorest in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.336.5/6">Before I finish, I want to mention some of the gimmicks and wheezes that the Labour party has offered as serious policies. Government giveaways will still have to be paid for by the taxpayer. It is madness to try to freeze energy prices. Anyone who has looked at the economic history of this country knows that the price and wage controls of the 1960s and 1970s completely failed. We have abandoned such policies. Opposition Members will remember that beer duty was frozen in the 1960s for two years, and in the third year the price of beer went up by 41%. That is no way to conduct an economic policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.337.0/1">It has become evident from today&#8217;s debate that the Government are incapable of making any real changes to improve the cost of living for our hard-pressed families up and down the country. Nothing seems to be changing for those people who, as they have told me, see the Government putting the wrong people first. The only growth people have seen on the high street has been in prices and in pawnbrokers, payday loans, cash-for-gold companies and betting shops.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.0/2">As has been said, prices are still going up faster than wages. That has been compounded by the fact that many of my constituents have experienced wage freezes over the past couple of years and/or have been moved to reduced hours or part-time working.</p>

	<p pid="a.337.1/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned payday loans, which are a scourge if ever there was one. Some 33% of people borrowing payday loans do so just to pay their basic household bills&#8212;just to live and get through the day&#8212;while 44% are borrowing to pay for their gas and electricity.

	<p pid="a.337.2/1">Absolutely. The hon. Gentleman is spot on about that indicator of what is happening in society. I will develop that theme further.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/2">Last April&#8217;s increase in the personal allowance does not make up for what families have already lost through tax and benefit changes. The cost of living is rising four times faster than earnings, on the back of a fall in real wages since this Chancellor took office. People are getting worse off, and the cost of living crisis is hitting hard-working families up and down this country. Families in Britain have taken a pay cut of &#163;1,200 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/3">What do families face week in, week out as they struggle to overcome the cost of living crisis? I will give some examples to highlight the severity of the squeeze on living standards. On the basic weekly shop for food and clothing at the supermarket, families are seeing less go into the shopping trolley and more go into the till. Some families no longer do such a one-stop shop, but flit from supermarket to supermarket to cash in on the bargains and stretch their pound even further. There are growing crowds around the mark-down shelves, buying food that must be consumed that day. That is surely an indication that people are living from hand to mouth. Citizens Advice has also produced evidence on food shopping:</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/4">&#8220;On average UK households purchased 4.2 per cent less food in 2011 than in 2007 while spending 12 per cent more.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/5">Families are facing record energy bills, while energy companies are enjoying huge profits. It is only Labour that is committed to freezing prices, not freezing families. At my surgery last week, many constituents came to me with their power bills, concerned about how they would pay them. That is at the start of winter. Goodness only knows how they will pay their bills at the end of winter. Again, I will quote Citizens Advice:</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/6">&#8220;Over the last three years the average domestic dual fuel energy bill has increased by 37 per cent.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/7">That is a massive hit on family budgets.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/8">Fuel prices are about 5 or 6p higher in Inverclyde than just 20 miles away. The pricing in my neck of the woods is unbelievable. There are different prices even within the boundaries of the town. The prices for one company vary from one end of the town to the other. The higher prices are predominantly in the areas where people can least manage the rising price of fuel.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/9">A big indicator of the cost of living crisis is the increase in the number of people who are turning up at the doors of food banks. It is a national disgrace that there is food poverty in one of the world&#8217;s largest economies. In Britain today, some 13 million people live below the poverty line. The number of Scottish families that attend food banks has risen by 100%. In my constituency of Inverclyde, the number of people using food banks has increased dramatically and shows no sign of falling. The fact that 50% of those who go to food banks are in work is shocking.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/10">What can I say about the impact of the welfare changes on my community? They have taken some &#163;2 million out of the local economy. That money was spent on essentials such as food and clothing. That is having an impact not only on the families affected, but on high streets and shops because it threatens the survival of small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/11">Where will the squeeze on living standards lead? It leads either in the direction of debt or towards desperate acts, of which I see more and more. In Inverclyde, one recent act&#8212;a metal theft, which we see up and down the country&#8212;sums up the desperation of families to get</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/12">money to subsidise their income. Some copper cabling, worth a mere &#163;30, was stolen from a substation in my constituency, plunging dozens of homes into darkness, leaving many people without heating and causing one home to burn to the ground&#8212;all that for &#163;30! It was a senseless act, but for what reason? Struggling&#8212;that is why I believe that crime took place and put in danger not only the lives of those who perpetrated it, but those of the people living on that estate. Only the kind-heartedness and community spirit of the people of Inverclyde will ensure that the family who have lost their home and possessions will have a Christmas and a roof over their heads.</p>
	<p pid="a.337.2/13">I know that many other Members wish to contribute to the debate, so I will conclude by saying that times are hard, living standards are definitely falling, and the Government&#8217;s economics are failing.</p>

	<p pid="a.339.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40688" name="Iain McKenzie">the hon. Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie)</phrase> and to speak in this debate. It gives me an opportunity to relate to the House the good news happening in Tamworth, which is not some leafy suburb but a no-nonsense, hard-working, gritty, midlands town. In Tamworth in the past 12 months, unemployment has fallen by 31%, youth unemployment by 35%, and long-term unemployment by nearly 40%.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.0/2">Last month I held a jobs fair at which there were more jobs than jobseekers. There were some 400 jobs, including apprenticeships at Jaguar Land Rover and Spline Gauges, 50 jobs at Marston&#8217;s brewery, and jobs at Toys R Us. That demonstrates in a small but significant way how we have turned a corner and are creating real, sustainable jobs and growth for our constituents. It is our job to do that, and a story that Labour Members do not like to tell, just as they do not like to be reminded of their last miserable years in government, when in my town jobs were lost across the board. One could walk down the Glascote road and see repossession notices in window after window, as banks foreclosed on people&#8217;s homes. People were not just losing their jobs under Labour, they were losing their homes as well. We will not listen to lectures from Opposition Members when we remember the grisly legacy of Labour&#8217;s years, and we will not let them forget it either.</p>

	<p pid="a.339.2/2">We have heard something from the Leader of the Opposition, whose latest stunt is to announce an energy price freeze. We should beware geeks bearing gifts, because that announcement is pretty hollow for three reasons. First, if a price freeze is imposed, companies will simply hike their prices before the freeze and afterwards, and people will be paying artificially high energy prices. That is what Professor Dieter Helm says, as well as Adam Scorer from Consumer Focus. Even the hon.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/3">Member for Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead) has raised that concern. He is a Labour member of the Energy and Climate Change Committee and says that Labour&#8217;s plans for an energy freeze are somewhat sketchy.</p>
	<p pid="a.339.2/4">The second reason a freeze will not work is that rather than break up the big six oligopoly, it will entrench it. Stephen Fitzpatrick of Ovo and the First Utility company&#8212;the company of choice for the Leader of the Opposition&#8212;say that a price freeze will make it more difficult for them to break into the market and operate, and that it will entrench the position of the big six, rather than break it up. The third reason the freeze will not work is that it will jeopardise &#163;125 billion-worth of investment that we must make in short order in our energy infrastructure&#8212;&#163;25 billion of that in the pipes and pylons that keep our lights switched on.</p>

	<p pid="a.340.0/1">Is there not a fourth problem? It would be a brave Government indeed who called an end to the so-called 20-month freeze precisely because, as they would know, prices would be likely to increase. Therefore, the chances are that prices would be frozen at that level.</p>

	<p pid="a.340.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point. I suspect that, were we, heaven forfend, to have a Labour Government, they would show a great deal of pusillanimity in the face of the energy companies&#8212;the big six that they created. We need to ensure that we get that infrastructure funding flowing from private enterprise. Unless we get that money from the private sector, the poor old taxpayer must foot the bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.1/2">We do not need an artificial, high price freeze in future; we need price cuts now. That is what will help our constituents, and that is what they want. That is what the Energy Bill will deliver. We need to make it easier for people to switch: 24-hour switching could save people up to &#163;200 on their energy bills. We need to get rid of the array of tariffs&#8212;under Labour, there were more than 400&#8212;and put people on the lowest tariff available. That could save people &#163;158. If we also roll back those green levies and do not impose the &#163;125 carbon tax that Labour tried to impose through the Energy Bill in the other place just two weeks ago, that will save our constituents money. That is real help for real people now, not the conjuring trick that the Leader of the Opposition, like some street magician, wants to undertake.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-27a.340.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40597" speakername="Geraint Davies" colnum="340"  time="017:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#131127-0003.htm_spnew59">
	<p pid="a.340.2/1">Today at Prime Minister&#8217;s Question Time, I accused the Prime Minister, in essence, of knowingly moving the economy forward in a way that means that real wages continually fall and house prices go up. He knows as well as all of us that we are moving towards the rocks of rising interest rates and a sub-prime debt crisis. He is a man looking to the future, walking backwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/2">There is a question over whether the Prime Minister is doing that completely unwittingly&#8212;is he sleepwalking towards disaster or knowingly walking towards it? I put it to the House that he is knowingly doing so. He is</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/3">inflating the housing market when he knows that people cannot afford higher interest rates. He is willing to take those risks in the knowledge that, if and when the Labour party takes office, there will be a sub-prime debt disaster, and he will be able to say, &#8220;It is old Labour messing things up.&#8221; He is willing to pay that price, because he believes that the feel-good factor from inflated house prices in London and the south-east&#8212;his core area&#8212;where he is investing 80% of Britain&#8217;s new infrastructure to buoy his vote, will be enough, alongside the media spin, to get him back into power. I put it to the House that it will not be enough, and that we should be alerting the British public to it and to what we should do about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/4">The Minister loosely referred to the funding for lending scheme used by our banks, but he would not take an intervention from me. The scheme provides easy lending, underpinned by the Bank of England. Lending to households for mortgages is now at the 2008 level, but lending to business is 32% lower than it was in 2008. What does that mean? It means that British money is not investing in productivity and growth for jobs, which means that wages are not growing and will not be strong enough to sustain the cost of higher house prices when interest rates go up.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/5">Interest rates will go up. Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, has clearly said that, when unemployment goes down to 7%, interest rates can be let free. That is great, is it not? Obviously, unemployment going down must be good&#8212;I can see Government Members nodding their heads&#8212;but, if overall production has not grown, average productivity will have gone down. Since 2010, productivity, in the main, has been flatlining and there is no growth in the economy. There is growth in the number of people in work because we are sharing the production around, which is why real wages are falling. We do not have the investment in training and in research and development. On investment as a proportion of GDP, we are 159th in the world. On R and D investment, we are at the bottom of the developed world. We are a basket case and it is no surprise that our triple A rating was taken away.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/6">We hear the same old Tory story that we always hear: &#8220;Labour messed it up and we have made the recovery.&#8221; The reality is that GDP grew by 40% between 1997 and 2008. We then had the international financial disaster. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> and President Obama stepped in with a fiscal stimulus to get us back to growth by 2010. Hey presto, the Tories arrived and announced that half a million people were going to be sacked, and people in the public sector stopped spending because they did not know when they were going to be sacked. So the Tories deflated consumer demand and growth has been flatlining ever since.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/7">What has happened to our debt-to-GDP ratio? It has gone up from 55% to 75%, and will go up to 85% by 2015, because GDP has been flatlining. Debt to GDP has gone up, because debt has gone up as well. This Government have borrowed more in three and a half years than the Labour Government borrowed in 13 years. The clowns spin the story again and again in this Chamber and in the media, and the marketing campaign is working well. The Prime Minister and the Chancellor are knowingly sending us down the track towards more sub-prime debt. They hope the propaganda war will be won if Labour gets in and it blows up in its face.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/8">This Government, and any future Labour Government, should, through the Bank of England, change the funding for lending scheme so that it focuses on business investment, not mortgage investment. Prior to the onset of the funding for lending scheme in July 2012, the mortgage market had already recovered, so we do not need the money that is going in. The scheme means that if you, Madam Deputy Speaker, were a bank, for every pound you lent to SMEs, you would have another &#163;10 to lend elsewhere. At the moment that is going to mortgages, not SMEs. That will be changed to a ratio of 5:1. If that were to be rebalanced, the Bank of England and the Government could finance business loans&#8212;existing loans, as well as future loans&#8212;and give more money to SMEs. The financial markets are already servicing the rest of it. In addition, we have the Help to Buy scheme. All the money is therefore being channelled into a fixed stock of houses and prices will go through the roof. Would it not be better to invest in business and construction? That would increase the number of houses, reduce prices and create work.</p>
	<p pid="a.340.2/9">We want a rational and sustainable economic strategy. Instead, we have a political trick that is sending us towards the abyss and the Government do not seem to care. They say that everything is recovering, but the essence of the debate is that everybody out there looks in their pockets and in their cupboards and knows that they are worse off. That will continue unless something is done to invest in business, productivity and growth.</p>

	<p pid="a.342.1/1">I am not quite with the hon. Gentleman. I do not know if my analysis is lost on Conservative Members who are just repeating things without understanding the economic debate, but I am saying that we should work with Mark Carney to rebalance the funding for lending scheme in favour of business, instead of supporting the mortgage market which is already on track. That would take some of the heat out of the housing market, and help to build more houses, grow productivity, increase wages and create sustainable growth. That has nothing to do with what is happening in Cardiff.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.1/2">A few references have been made to Wales, and I might as well respond to them, now that we have heard another Tory intervention. The reality is that 80% of all infrastructure investment in the UK goes to London and the south-east. Wales is one of the poorest areas of the United Kingdom; a quarter of the people live in poverty, the majority of them in work. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40151" name="Simon Hart">The hon. Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (Simon Hart)</phrase> will know, because he is a member of the Welsh Affairs Committee, that what is being put in place in Wales, the future jobs fund and so on, works much more effectively than the UK Government&#8217;s Work programme. Wales is doing its best in difficult times, but the Government will not even reduce the tolls on the Severn bridge to provide further stimulus, because they do not care. All they care about is sustaining their own backyard. We have this weakened economy when there are enormous opportunities to make us strong. It is a disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.1/3">I will continue to make those points about the Government, because it is becoming ever clearer that they are knowingly heading towards a sub-prime debt crisis. They should be ashamed.</p>

	<p pid="a.343.0/1">The cost of living is a legitimate subject for debate. I was interested to hear Ross Smith of the North East chamber of commerce comment on the solution:</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/2">&#8220;My answer to this is &#8216;it&#8217;s skills, stupid&#8217;&#8212;alas that doesn&#8217;t fit with easy election messages or election cycles.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/3">To be fair, that was a tweet, playing on Bill Clinton&#8217;s famous line in 1992 that, &#8220;It&#8217;s the economy, stupid&#8221;, so I asked Ross to expand on it yesterday as part of my consultation in preparation for this speech. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/4">&#8220;the most important factor in raising living standards in the long term is to increase skill levels so that people can play a more productive part in a stronger economy and be rewarded accordingly.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/5">I could not agree more.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/6">To that end, we must look at apprenticeships, which surely can play a key part in any skills regeneration. The north-east is clearly leading the way. The number of apprenticeship starts in the north-east has increased by 11% since 2010-11, to 38,340. That was up from 18,510 in 2009-10 and 13,500 in 2005-06. In other words, it has trebled since the Blair Government. In my constituency, the number of apprenticeship programme starts has gone from 430 in 2009-10 to 690 in 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/7">Of course, it is not just about the number of apprenticeships; it is also about their quality. To that end, I am delighted that the Government have decided that one of the skills pilots will be in the north-east. In fact, it was the North East local enterprise partnership and the Adonis review that suggested the skills pilots that will go ahead. It is to be joined by the Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire LEP and the West of England LEP. It is a chance for businesses to engage with their skills and apprenticeship needs so that there is a focus on the particular parts of the economy where growth in jobs is needed in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/8">There is ample evidence of the successes, whether the opening of the engineering academy in Hexham by Egger, with 40 jobs created, the work done by Nissan, the 38 new jobs in the IT sector, the new apprenticeship jobs in Accenture, whose managing director came to see me yesterday, or the work done by Siemens, particularly in relation to the university technical college in Durham. I strongly hope that the LEP will carry that forward in such a way that the Adonis report will have a true impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/9">One cannot address the economy, certainly in my region, which has 2.4 million people, without looking at the Adonis report. No other region in the country has addressed its strengths and weaknesses as the north-east has with that report. It was business led, written by experts, apolitical, hard hitting and realistic. It assessed both the strengths of the local area and the weaknesses. It celebrated assets but acknowledged that there have been successive failures, by successive Governments, to improve job numbers, address skills deficits, increase university starts and generally grow the economy. I am profoundly grateful to all its authors.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/10">At the report&#8217;s heart lay a desire for more and better jobs, as it identified the crucial lack of private sector employment. However, as it states:</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/11">&#8220;More jobs alone will not re-balance the economy. The North East needs higher skilled and higher paid jobs to produce an economy which matches others and provides the quality of opportunities that its residents and young people need to prosper.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/12">How do we proceed to that? We must support the necessary investment in apprenticeships, build on the skills pilots and consider the recommendations in the Adonis report&#8212;I will not repeat its 24 pages, Madam Deputy Speaker, despite the Irn-Bru you saw me have at the Scotland Better Together event earlier. The seven local authorities must be allowed to go forward. They are coming together and driving forward with a regional voice to match the likes of Manchester who have led the way so well in these matters in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.343.0/13">I cannot finish without addressing the motion. On the proposed energy price freeze, I entirely endorse the comment from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40598" name="Christopher Pincher">the Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher)</phrase> that one should always be wary of geeks bearing gifts. On the need for long-term housing supply, I accept that there is that need, but it is a shame that my two Labour authorities are keen to build on the green belt, rather than on the other available sites. On action for young people, I would certainly support such action, but it is this Government who have trebled the number of apprenticeships and set up the welcome north-east skills pilot. I find it very easy, therefore, to reject the motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.344.1/1">I could speak for an hour, and have done so on several previous occasions in the House, on Labour-run Northumberland county council&#8217;s failure to provide brownfield sites and its proposal to build on the green belt, whether around Ponteland, Hexham or other sites in Northumberland.

	<p pid="a.344.3/1">I have no doubt that building on contaminated brownfield sites can be difficult, but in my constituency, for example, the police authority has sold the site of a former police station that could be built on perfectly properly. For 20 years, taxpayers&#8212;that includes the hon. Gentleman and me&#8212;paid more than &#163;1 million to keep the former Stannington hospital site secure, yet nothing was built on it. We now have former government sites being built on and providing homes, but of course that is not green belt. He was keen to make his point about brownfield sites, but he also spoke</p>

The Government&#8217;s answer, as provided by the Financial Secretary in a rather frivolous and distinctly provocative knockabout, was, predictably, yes. He simply repeated the well-worn Tory mantra that we all know: Labour left behind a huge economic mess; there was no other way to deal with it other than through massive cuts in public expenditure; we were &#8220;all in it together&#8221;; and now the Chancellor&#8217;s policies have been vindicated as it has all come right.

	<p pid="a.345.6/2">First, Labour did not leave an economic mess. The budget deficit in 2007-08, just before the crash, was 2.6% of gross domestic product&#8212;one of the lowest in the OECD and about the same as Germany&#8217;s. It rose to 11.6% in 2010 only as a result of the bankers&#8217; bail-out. I noted that the Financial Secretary did not even mention the banks today, so I was beginning to wonder whether he had even heard of the bankers&#8217; bail-out. <i>[Interruption.]</i>I am prepared to give way at this point, before going on to answer in some detail.</p>

	<p pid="a.345.8/1">That may well have had something to do with it, but it happened also because the Tories decided to blank out the bankers&#8217; bail-out and put the whole blame on the Labour party. For any objective economist or objective observer of any kind, that is obviously absurd.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.8/2">Secondly, there was another and much better way to deal with the budget deficit than through semi-permanent austerity. It is costing the country &#163;19 billion a year to keep 2.5 million people unemployed. I simply say that it would have been far better to get these people off benefit and into work through public investment, so that they could earn and contribute to the Exchequer through taxes and national insurance contributions. I well know that the question will come, &#8220;How do we pay for that?&#8221;, so I shall answer it. This can still be done&#8212;and it could have been done three years ago&#8212;without any increase in public borrowing at all, despite the Chancellor&#8217;s continuous jibes to the contrary, by a further tranche of quantitative easing targeted not on the banks but directly on industry, or by instructing the publicly owned banks RBS and Lloyds to prioritise lending to industry, or by taxing the ultra-rich.</p>

	<p pid="a.346.1/1">There has been a great deal of partisanship in this debate, and I am prepared to recognise that the problems did not start with the present Government. I agree that we should have taken a much tougher line with the banks before 2010, but let us concentrate on where we are now, because the country is in a very serious position.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/2">That brings me to the third point. We never were &#8220;all in it together&#8221;&#8212;quite the opposite, and to a stunning degree. In <i>The Sunday Times</i> rich list, the richest 1,000 of the UK&#8217;s citizens&#8212;a tiny 0.003% of the population&#8212;increased their wealth in the five years since the crash by a staggering &#163;190 billion, while 90% of the population over exactly the same period have had to take a real-terms cut of about 9%, and their wages are still falling. So much for social solidarity! If that &#163;190 billion were charged to capital gains tax, it could technically raise &#163;53 billion. I do not think it would for a moment, but it could realistically raise roughly &#163;30 billion to &#163;35 billion&#8212;quite enough to generate 1 million to 1.5 million jobs within two or three years. That would be a far quicker way of reducing the budget deficit&#8212;which is supposed to be the aim of the exercise&#8212;than spending cuts could ever be.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/3">The Government&#8217;s fourth point is that we have a recovery. Well, we do have a recovery of sorts, but one that has been generated in exactly the wrong way. It has been generated by consumer borrowing and an incipient bubble, and it is not&#8212;I repeat, not&#8212;a real, sustainable recovery. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40597" name="Geraint Davies">the Member for Swansea West (Geraint Davies)</phrase> pointed out, such a recovery can come about only as a result of rising investment, increasing productivity, growing wages and healthy exports, and none of those is present now.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/4">Over the last five years, Britain&#8217;s business investment has dropped in real terms by a devastating 25%, well below the global average. UK productivity is now almost the lowest among the OECD countries. As we were told by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase>, UK wages are undergoing the biggest fall since the 1870s, and are still falling. As for exports, Britain&#8217;s deficit on traded goods is still running at a</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/5">mountainous rate of over &#163;100 billion a year. If that is a recovery, then God help us if we ever experience a downturn.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/6">So has the Government&#8217;s economic policy failed? Not necessarily. It all depends on what we think the Government&#8217;s objectives really were. If the objective was to cut the budget deficit, as they claim, then yes: I think that the last three years of unending misery and austerity have involved a momentous waste of resources in return for almost nothing. According to the Government&#8217;s own figures, the budget deficit was &#163;118 billion in 2011 and &#163;115 billion in 2012. Like those who engaged in trench warfare during the first world war, we have advanced a few dozen yards, and have taken enormous casualties in order to do so. No sane person would continue with such a policy at such expense in blood and treasure, yet here we have a Government who are determined to slog on with exactly the same policies, and&#8212;as with the generals in the first world war&#8212;the cost is not to them, but only to the poor squaddies who are sent over the top.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/7">My last point relates to a recent speech by the Prime Minister, which I am amazed he gave, and which I think will come back to haunt him. He said that even when the deficit was paid off&#8212;and I think that that time could be nearer to 2030 than 2020, given the direction in which we are going&#8212;there would be no restoration of spending that had been cut. The Tories, he proclaimed, believed in</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/8">&#8220;a leaner, more efficient state&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/9">What he really meant, of course, was a fully privatised state in which you had better succeed in the market, because otherwise there will be precious little help from public sources when you need it.</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/10">As for &#8220;efficient&#8221;, was that G4S at the Olympics? Was it Serco charging for tagging prisoners who had already died or left prison? Was it the big six energy companies ruthlessly profiteering at customers&#8217; expense? Was it the water companies indulging in a profit bonanza for top executives and shareholders, but trying still to charge taxpayers? Was it outsourcing in the NHS, which has led to longer waiting lists and an inability to cope? Was it the free schools that have been set up in areas where there is an abundance of places, while other areas where there is a shortage of places are abandoned? Lean and efficient? Come on!</p>
	<p pid="a.346.1/11">I really do not believe that the Tory leadership sees the prolonged austerity and the economic disaster that have been visited on the country over the last five years as a failure at all. The Tories see that as merely the price to be paid&#8212;although not, of course, by them&#8212;for attaining the real objective, which is a permanent squeezing of the public sector and a shrinking of the state. That is what they want to do if they win the next election, and that is why I believe they will not win it.</p>

	<p pid="a.347.0/1">The Opposition do not have a monopoly on understanding the pressures on people or on wanting to do something about the cost of living. I represent the fourth poorest ward in the country, and I am well aware of the pressures that my constituents face. They know that they will not cut their cost of living by borrowing money and running up interest</p>
	<p pid="a.347.0/2">costs. They also know that shutting their eyes, going into denial and spending &#163;4 for every &#163;3 of their income will lead to tears. Sadly, the Labour Government did not understand those things, and everything did end in tears. This Government are now having to clear up the mess.</p>
	<p pid="a.347.0/3">As we have heard, the way to deal with the cost of living crisis is to get the economy moving and to get manufacturing going again, and I welcome all the steps that the Government are taking in that direction after the catastrophic halving of our manufacturing industries under Labour. The Government can do two things about the cost of living: they can take tax and spend measures and they can interfere in industry and business. On tax and spend, I am proud of the Government&#8217;s action to scrap Labour&#8217;s fuel duty escalator, saving &#163;7 on a tank of fuel, to scrap Labour&#8217;s beer duty escalator and to give free child care to 260,000 two-year-olds and, from next year, to three and four-year-olds.</p>

	<p pid="a.348.0/1">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the fuel duty escalator, but I wonder why he omitted to mention the rise in VAT from 17.5% to 20%, which also affected the price of fuel.</p>

	<p pid="a.348.1/1">The &#163;7 that I mentioned is net of the &#163;1.50 VAT increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.1/2">Interest rates are being kept down, and council tax has been frozen for three years in many areas. Sadly, my Labour council has preferred to take money out of people&#8217;s pockets rather than taking Government money to keep the council tax down.</p>

	<p pid="a.348.2/1">As a fellow MP in the Redcar and Cleveland borough council area, the hon. Gentleman will know that, between 2003 and 2007, the coalition Lib Dem, Conservative and independent council raised council tax by more than 25%, which was more than during the previous four years or the following four years under Labour.</p>

	<p pid="a.348.3/1">The hon. Gentleman has an excellent memory. I think that people will judge the council on how it is spending the money that it raises.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.3/2">This Government have also scrapped Labour&#8217;s national insurance hike and, above all, implemented the Lib Dem policy of raising the tax threshold to &#163;10,000.</p>

	<p pid="a.348.5/1">I am sorry; I have taken two interventions already.</p>
	<p pid="a.348.5/2">We hear a lot from Labour about wages, but it is what ends up in people&#8217;s pay packets that really counts. When Labour left office, people on the minimum wage were paying a massive &#163;35 a week in tax and national insurance. Since then, the minimum wage has gone up by &#163;20 a week, but the national insurance bill for those people has gone down by &#163;9 a week, with a further cut to come in April.</p>

	<p pid="a.348.6/1">In my constituency, there are fewer people unemployed, and employers welcome the cut in national insurance contributions because it helps to create more jobs. Also, nearly 5,000 people there are now paying no tax at all. That is the way to help people who are finding life tough: more jobs and less tax.</p>

	<p pid="a.349.0/1">I certainly agree with that. I wish that my area was as fortunate with employment, but my hon. Friend makes an excellent point. That is the direction we should be taking.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/2">I helped to launch an event for the Living Wage Foundation two weeks ago. It has stated that it</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/3">&#8220;supports moves to increase the personal allowance for the low-paid&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/4">because they&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/5">&#8220;could make the Living Wage easier to attain.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/6">The living wage is about net pay, not gross pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/7">I have talked about tax and spend measures. I also mentioned interfering in industry. I welcome today&#8217;s announcement on payday lending, following an amendment tabled by a Lib Dem peer the other day. The Government have stepped in quickly to do something about the problem. We interfere in industry at our peril, however. The Opposition motion mentions an &#8220;energy price freeze&#8221;. I worked at senior level in business, finance and industry for more than 25 years, five of which were spent working as an accountant in the electricity industry. I could scarcely believe Labour&#8217;s proposal for a price freeze. In three and a half years in this place, I have never heard a policy announcement so guaranteed to achieve the opposite effect to the one that was intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/8">It has been obvious from the start that any business faced with having its prices fixed but its costs varying dramatically, as they do in the electricity industry, would have real problems. Prices would increase before the freeze and after it. Prices that had been frozen could not decrease if the costs reduced. Above all, less investment will take place, especially from new players. So what has happened since Labour&#8217;s announcement? We have seen huge price hikes, which I am sure include hedging just in case the public are stupid enough to elect a Labour Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.349.2/1">I have already given way and I am in my own time now. Two weeks ago, National Grid said that half of proposed investment in energy was now on hold because of political uncertainty. This week, RWE abandoned the Atlantic array. This is what is happening in the real world of business as a result of the irresponsible announcement from Labour. At Dod&#8217;s energy lunch a Cross-Bench peer described how this policy was disastrous for commercial confidence, and he is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.2/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40598" name="Christopher Pincher">the hon. Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher)</phrase> said, the irony is that the policy protects the big six. When I mentioned that before, the shadow Energy Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40206" name="Caroline Flint">the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, said from a sedentary position that we were protecting the big six by challenging the policy, but that is not true. In my constituency, three new energy investors want to invest&#8212;two in fossil fuels and one in renewables. There are US, Japanese and Korean investors behind these projects, but the projects are now in danger because their bankers are wondering what on earth is going to happen to this country&#8217;s electricity industry. So this irresponsible announcement by Labour threatens investment and security of supply, and, above all, it will raise prices, both in the short term and the long term. So I urge the Opposition to withdraw the policy as soon as possible to avoid more damage to consumers and to the electricity industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.2/3">We do need to do things about our energy future. One key thing that must happen is that we must have genuine competition, based on more players. The fact that pay levels are too high in many industries, including the electricity industry, is clear. However, at least this Government are taxing capital gains at a higher rate, taxing pension contributions at a much higher rate and taxing income at a rate 5% higher than under the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.2/4">A few weeks ago, the shadow Health Secretary made a point about Front Benchers of all parties&#8212;I think he was thinking partly of his own. He said that we now see policies developed by people who have been trained&#8212;this is about career politicians&#8212;to write press releases rubbishing the opposition. We can tell the lack of strategic thinking behind that announcement. The Opposition have shown that they know how to write headlines, but they do not understand business and finance. As always is the case, we cannot trust Labour with the economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.350.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate. Over the past few months, we have seen the spectre of the Chancellor and the Prime Minister on repeated occasions suggesting that everything is rosy and that hundreds of thousands of jobs are sloshing around. It is the old attitude of, &#8220;Crisis, what crisis?&#8221; Unfortunately, such a view is completely out of touch with the daily, lived experience of many of my constituents and thousands of others across Wales, who have seen one of the greatest falls in real average earnings&#8212;a staggering drop of &#163;1,669, or 8%, since the general election, when this Government came to power. They see this Government as out of touch, patronising and complacent; they see a Government on the side of the rich, of millionaires and of banking and energy bosses, as we heard aptly demonstrated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40494" name="Ian Swales">the hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales)</phrase>. It is Labour Members who are on the side of the British people, with solutions such as capping the cost of credit and payday loans, and freezing energy prices. These real measures would help the real lives that many on the Treasury Bench seem to have little understanding of.</p>

	<p pid="a.350.2/1">My hon. Friend is right to point out that the energy price scandal has been going on for some time, and that the Government have done nothing to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.350.2/2">I welcome any growth and any new jobs in the economy, and I hope that any positive movement in the economy will help people in my area address the massive drop in earnings since this Government came to power. However, I caution that illusions are simply not good enough. The Government repeatedly fail to answer questions about how many new jobs are part-time and, of those, how many are on zero-hours contracts. They also do not say in what sectors those jobs are being created. The truth is that half the new jobs are in low-paid sectors, and that the minimum wage is not always being enforced.</p>
	<p pid="a.350.2/3">When I hear the Chancellor crowing about recovery, I am always tempted to ask, whose recovery and what sort of recovery. Is it a recovery benefiting my constituents who are struggling to find well-paid jobs, to pay those soaring energy bills and to put food on the table for their children? Is it helping those who are struggling to cope with the bedroom tax? One well-known local Liberal Democrat member in Cardiff recently said in a tweet that she knew that it was difficult for some people, yet many Liberal Democrats proudly voted for the bedroom tax in this House the other night. It is not just difficult but increasingly impossible for many families across my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.350.2/4">Let me share with the House three stories that I have come across recently. First&#8212;I hope that the hon. Member for Redcar is listening&#8212;one of my constituents came to me saying that his monthly direct debit to npower had been increased from &#163;197 to &#163;254 just after he had been reimbursed an overpayment. I contacted npower and found that that was on top of the price rise of 10.4%. For him, the rise is 28.9%, which is extraordinary. That is the sort of issue that is affecting people in the country. How will that man make ends meet over the next few months? <i>[Interruption.] </i>The hon. Member for Redcar is chuntering from a sedentary position. As he does not seem to be interested, perhaps he would like to intervene and respond to that sort of example.</p>

	<p pid="a.351.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will know that we called for a price freeze now, but it was the Government who voted against it. He should look at what is happening on his own Benches before making such comments. How is the recovery helping constituents who are being slammed by energy prices?</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/2">Let me give another example. A single father in the east of Cardiff with a 12-year-old daughter who lives with him full-time has just been sanctioned for two weeks for not providing enough evidence of his job search. He has actually provided a lot of evidence. He has been applying for multiple jobs, even in the bar and restaurant industry, despite having a history of alcohol abuse and being advised not to work in that sector. He has always worked and has never claimed social security before. He is not computer literate and has only been given limited assistance with his job search and he is not allowed to submit handwritten evidence of his job search. He is not in receipt of any other social security benefits, so the only money that is coming in is child benefit and tax credits. He has been struggling to manage over the past few weeks. After paying all of his bills, he was left with &#163;3 to feed himself and his daughter. The real tragedy is that his daughter is trying to help the family by bringing home her school lunch because she is worried that she will not get fed at home. He is absolutely distressed and mortified to be in that position. Where is the recovery for him and his daughter?</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/3">My last example is of a gentleman who came to see me at my surgery the other week. He was being sanctioned for being unwilling to travel far away from home. He does not have a car and it was extortionately expensive</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/4">to travel to the area to which he was asked to go and it would have left him out of pocket. As a result, he did not take that job, but he is willing to take any other job that he is offered. None the less, he was sanctioned and his money was put down to just &#163;40 a week. I am fighting on his behalf with the jobcentre. The reality is that he has very little on which to live. He told me that he was not able to put on the heating and electricity. He said that it was not that cold, despite the fact that the weather outside was freezing. He was putting on extra jumpers just to try to cope and to get by&#8212;he was in an absolutely awful position. He has worked all his life and now he is not putting on the heating or the electric, so where is the recovery for him?</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/5">Those are the real stories of people living under this Government. They simply do not recognise the rosy picture that the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and other Ministers have been telling us about over the past few days. The story across Wales as a whole is equally concerning. More people are hit by the bedroom tax in Wales than in any other area in the UK. Even <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40407" name="David Davies">the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies)</phrase>, despite some of his more outrageous comments the other day, has admitted, as Chair of the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs, that significant challenges are caused by its impact in Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/6">We have some of the highest energy prices in the country and 1 million households would benefit from Labour&#8217;s price freeze. Wales has the biggest increase in those in energy debt compared with anywhere in the UK, up by 24% in the past two years. People are now consistently falling into arrears with the energy companies as a result of those price rises. We have seen one of the biggest falls in real wages across the UK and one of the largest increases in under-employment&#8212;that is, people who want to work more hours but are unable to do so because of the types of jobs that are available. They do not recognise the fantasy of the 1 million or so jobs that the Government keep citing.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/7">I have described some heart-rending cases, but we also heard earlier about food banks. The use of food banks in Wales has trebled in recent times and in every part of my constituency, from Penarth to Splott to Llanrumney, I am seeing increasing numbers of people who are accessing those food banks. That is why I was so disappointed to hear the remarks of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40623" name="Alun Cairns">the hon. Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns)</phrase>, who is no longer in his seat. He attempted to suggest earlier that I had somehow misled the House on his views about food banks. Let me put on the record the reasons for people using food banks that he gave to his local paper, the <i>Barry &amp; District News</i>, on <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-05">5 September</phrase>. He said, and I quote directly, that they were</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/8">&#8220;inability to manage money and to budget, addiction to alcohol or substance misuse, bullying at home, neglect by the benefit recipient and a range of other reasons.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/9">He did not recognise or comment on the real reasons people are going to food banks: energy prices, low wages, the social security changes or delays that the Trussell Trust says are the biggest reason for people going to food banks, the low incomes that the trust also points to as another such reason, and the debt that many people are getting into with payday lenders, loan sharks and others. I believe that it was right for him to be criticised by local Labour councillors for a local Labour council that is doing an immense amount to</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/10">help people in very difficult times, including working with Cardiff on a collective energy buying scheme to help reduce the pressure from the energy companies, which are ripping off consumers across the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/11">The figures for the whole of Wales tell an even greater story. Some 400,000 people have been hit by the Government&#8217;s squeeze on tax credits and social security overall; that can be compared with the 4,000 richest in the country, who got a handout from the Government with the tax cut for millionaires.</p>
	<p pid="a.351.1/12">My constituents and people across Wales are asking again and again: whose side are the Government on, who is benefiting from this so-called recovery and who will stand up for them? Time and again, they are left wanting by Tory and Lib Dem Members. They will get a much better deal if they vote for Labour at the next general election.</p>

	<p pid="a.353.0/1">This is indeed a very important debate. We can hear stories from any part of the House about the struggles that our constituents are going through. Indeed, constituents who one might deem to be on very good salaries are struggling, too. Whether someone is on a good salary or unemployed, if they are on a fixed income&#8212;including even those on good salaries who have had them frozen&#8212;a rise in the cost of living has a direct impact on their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/2">We must recognise the things we have to try to do to change the situation for the long term. Unemployment in my constituency has reduced by 32% since the Government came to power. We should welcome not only that reduction but the transfer of jobs from the public to the private sector, as quite a few small industrial bases in my constituency are supplying those jobs. As the economy is now turning a corner, growth in the economy and in the productivity of companies will allow wages to go up in line. What I do not support is a false rise in wages.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/3">The minimum wage is very important; it ensures that people are not exploited, and as the Prime Minister outlined earlier today, if companies are found to have broken the minimum wage legislation, they will be fined a huge amount of money. We hope that will crack down on some of the more ruthless employers. We talk about a living wage&#8212;we would all hope to achieve a living wage&#8212;but it should not be specified in statute. By increasing wages falsely&#8212;in London, by 40%&#8212;we ensure that a living wage is always just out of reach.</p>

	<p pid="a.353.1/1">I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman remembers that exactly the same arguments were advanced, mainly by members of his party, before the minimum wage was introduced. We were told that jobs would be lost&#8212;that it would be a terrible thing&#8212;but those predictions did not come true, so perhaps the hon. Gentleman is exaggerating his case.</p>

	<p pid="a.353.2/1">I am most grateful for the hon. Lady&#8217;s intervention because she makes the point that I wanted to make. I did not say that the living wage would cost jobs; I said that it would inflate wages. Many would argue that a lot of people already earn the living wage, and that a statutory living wage would benefit all those</p>
	<p pid="a.353.2/2">underneath. But we are all well aware how many people, especially our friends in the unions, would demand a 40% pay rise if it was to go through.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.2/3">Ultimately, there is nothing to be gained by inflating wages artificially, as we did in the 1970s. I remember my parents telling me that when they were teachers in the 1970s, they got a 25% pay rise when Harold Wilson came to power in 1975 but it was worthless the following year. The goal is always slightly out of reach. We must tackle the cost of living, and ensure that people&#8217;s real wages and real net income can advance to meet it.</p>

	<p pid="a.354.0/1">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Government have said that work must always pay, but we still have people who are in work living in severe poverty. More important than just having a job is the level of income, and that is why wages are so important, and that is why the living wage is so important. Does he not recognise that point?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-27a.354.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40245" speakername="Alec Shelbrooke" colnum="354"  time="017:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0003.htm#131127-0003.htm_spnew98">
	<p pid="a.354.1/1">I could not agree more. What I am saying is that we need to grow an economy to ensure that we can get to a living wage, and that at the same time we should be looking at how we reduce the cost of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/2">Why is the cost of living so high today? That is the fundamental question. Fundamentally, the cost of living comes down to one very important point&#8212;energy. We have had a lot of debate in the House this afternoon about whether to have an energy freeze, but if we freeze energy prices for a fixed period, prices will get ramped up before and after the freeze, as happened with the beer price freeze in the 1960s. We must take a more long-term view.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/3">How did we end up where we are? It is my personal view&#8212;I support what was in our manifesto, and I wish we had moved further on it&#8212;that we need to start replacing our power stations, and at the moment nuclear power stations are by far the best way forward. It has taken a lot of effort and lengthy negotiations to get to one nuclear power station; we should be building five or six. But at the same time the world oil price is rising, and will not go down despite what anyone thinks. To put it in context, in 1998 a barrel of oil was $5 a barrel, and yesterday Brent crude was $100 a barrel&#8212;I am sure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> will correct me if I am wrong. I believe that if oil reaches $140 a barrel, there is more economically recoverable oil in the North sea than has already been extracted. That is the reality of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/4">Energy prices will not come down, so it is no good having a freeze for a period, because energy prices permeate every aspect of the cost of living&#8212;the price of food in the shops, the price of getting to work. We always talk about the petrol price, which has a big impact on getting to work, but we must do everything that we can to reduce the cost of getting goods to the shops, because that hits people&#8217;s wages. Since the start of this recession we have been on a wage freeze, if not a wage reduction, to prevent the runaway unemployment that we saw in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/5">What frustrates me in debates such as that we are having today is not just the barrage of criticism from the Opposition of the way in which the Government have implemented their policies. That is fine; that is what we are in the House for. We are here to say that we</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/6">have a route, we are sticking to it, and we think that it is working, and the Opposition are here to say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t agree.&#8221; But I have not heard any real alternative in the Chamber today. The closest we got&#8212;one of the more sensible speeches today&#8212;was the contribution by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40468" name="Michael Meacher">the right hon. Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher)</phrase>, who is no longer in his seat. He actually came up with some suggestions. I did not agree with them&#8212;I thought they were pie-in-the-sky thinking&#8212;but at least he stood there and put forward some policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.354.1/7">Sadly, proposals were completely lacking in the shadow Chief Secretary&#8217;s speech. There was a constant barrage on what the Government had, he thought, got wrong, but no recognition of the fact that if we are going to tackle the cost of living crisis, we must tackle its root causes. The cost of living is going up because energy prices are high, and that has nothing to do with the six energy companies&#8212;there were 14 when the Leader of the Opposition was Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, but there were only six by the time he left that office, so it is a bit rich of him to come across saying that it is terrible. The inescapable truth is that the price of oil is not going to come down.</p>

	<p pid="a.355.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting speech. He talks about having more oil and it being economically extractable, but he will accept that part of the equation is tax. Does he not regret the massive hike in the North sea supplementary charge that resulted in project after project being cancelled, and made certain fields less viable?</p>

	<p pid="a.355.1/1">The hon. Gentleman will agree that the hundreds of millions of pounds of tax credits that the Government have made available to the oil and gas industry will help make that resource more exploitable in future and keep the supplies on. It comes down to a fundamental issue: what do we need to do to tackle the cost of living crisis? What we do not need, and what my constituents do not want to hear, is &#8220;It&#8217;s your fault for going down the austerity route&#8221; or &#8220;The collapse of the banks is your fault.&#8221; They want to say, &#8220;Look, we know all that&#8212;we know what&#8217;s going on.&#8221; That is why in most opinion polls, a majority of people still blame the Labour Government for the economic mess we are in. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It is all very well <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" name="Tom Blenkinsop">the hon.

	<p pid="a.355.3/1">I have given way enough. I am sorry&#8212;I am running out of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/2">We have to tackle the core issue, and we have to do two things at the same time. The Government are achieving the first one. We have put the economy on the road to recovery following the deepest recession in the history of the nation caused by lack of fiscal control of the banking system&#8212;a tripartite system that allowed the banking industry to run wild. Even today, as we see with the Co-op bank, the Labour party is unwilling to take tough decisions with regard to banking. The only public inquiry that the Leader of the Opposition does not want to call for is into the Co-op&#8212;I wonder why, but we will find out when it takes place.</p>
	<p pid="a.355.3/3">We have to grow the economy, which will lead to wage rises, but we must also have a much longer strategic look at how we supply energy in this country. I agree with the Prime Minister&#8212;whether or not what was reported in the newspapers was true, green taxes are regressive, and it is amazing that the Labour party, which has always opposed regressive taxation, says that we should keep a regressive tax and not push it into a progressive tax. At the end of the day, energy prices have gone up. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> These are luxuries from the boom time that people can ill afford. It is a disgrace that, despite the fact that we are doing everything that we can to grow the economy, and create real jobs that will last and, I hope, be better proofed against the ups and downs of Government spending in future, people are struggling to deal with the cost of heating and the cost of food. The fundamental cause is the high price of energy. It is absolutely vital that the energy reforms and fiscal reforms introduced by the Government carry on and should only be changed as we move forward with energy policies for the long term, not short-term gimmicks. That is what people need.</p>

	<p pid="a.356.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention, but he needs to look at the bigger picture, which is what I will go on to talk about&#8212;the cost of everyday living in general.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.2/2">Water costs a further &#163;30 per month to my constituents. Rent makes another significant impact. A single bedroom property costs &#163;395 a month in the private rented sector. Social properties are, of course, cheaper, but as my hon. Friends have explained on numerous occasions, there are few such properties to go around. Council tax starts at &#163;80, so we need to take that off the overall budget. We are talking about working people who, if they have children, will also need to cover the cost of child care. As Labour highlighted in last week&#8217;s debate, the cost of child care is rising five times faster than pay and now amounts to more than &#163;100 per child per week for 25 hours. That is around &#163;460 per month.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.2/3">All this leaves the average individual in my constituency with just &#163;244 to live on per month. That needs to cover food, transport, other bills as well as a multitude of other costs that are part of daily life. I admit that this is</p>
	<p pid="a.356.2/4">rather a crude calculation, but the fact is that people in South Shields living on this meagre income are the lucky ones. Despite everything, they have managed to hang on to their homes and provide for their families through sheer tenacity and the hard work ethic that permeates my constituency. But what about those who fall below the average? What about those on zero-hours contracts, the 3,592 unemployed, the elderly and frail, the homeless and the rough sleepers? And there are those who are affected by the Government&#8217;s bedroom tax, who will lose an extra &#163;450 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.356.2/5">Five thousand children in my constituency live in poverty, and many of them live in households with a parent in work. Some 4,260 of my constituents live in fuel poverty, and 1,440 of them are affected by the bedroom tax. We have a rise in homelessness and a rise in rough sleepers, yet still this Government fail them. This is a Government led by a Prime Minister who said prior to the 2010 elections that the Conservatives</p>
	<p pid="a.356.2/6">&#8220;are best placed to fight poverty in our country.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.356.2/7">This is an astonishing claim when we know that over a million people have fallen into poverty on his watch, including 300,000 children.</p>

	<p pid="a.357.1/1">I do not have time. I am sorry.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/2">My local citizens advice bureau, despite taking on extra staff, is struggling to cope with the volume of inquiries it has had about debt. The once monthly requests for emergency food aid are now almost a daily occurrence. My local food bank and soup kitchen have seen demand for their service rise to unprecedented levels. Increasingly, the people coming to these agencies, I am told, are in work. This is no surprise, as we now have 1.4 million more people being paid below the living wage than in 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/3">When I was unemployed, when members of my family and I fell on hard times, I was proud to live in a country where I and they would be able to get help. This is no longer the case. I am still proud of my country, just not of the people who are running it.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/4">People are turning to payday loans to deal with the hardship they face. Last year in my constituency the average borrowing constituent had debt to the tune of &#163;1,610. We all know how quickly this debt can become unmanageable, with dire consequences for those who owe. But these are not people after easy money. They are working people who no longer have the ability to save for a rainy day.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/5">As bad as things are for working people, they are worse for the unemployed. In my constituency more than 3,500 people are out of work. The Chancellor said that</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/6">&#8220;every job lost in the public sector has been offset by three new jobs in the private sector.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2013-06-26.305"><i>Official Report</i>, 26 June 2013; Vol. 565, c. 305</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/7">This has not happened in South Shields. I recently held a jobs fair in my constituency, and had great co-operation from local employers, but the total number of jobs that these organisations were able to offer was just over 1,000, well short of filling our employment gap.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/8">The situation is worse for our young. A constituent of mine told me how his daughter was offered a job interview and forced to travel to Leeds at short notice. She did not have the money to pay for the train ticket.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/9">When she asked the DWP for help, she was refused it. She is now on a zero-hours contract, and some weeks her pay is lower than when she was claiming benefit&#8212;but I suppose this Government do not mind about that, as long as she is no longer contributing to the unemployment statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/10">In my constituency people come together every day to help those who are struggling, but they find their task harder and harder as levels of need are rising to an unprecedented degree. Organisations such as Citizens Advice, the Key project, Hospitality and Hope, St Aidan&#8217;s, Supported Living and St Hilda&#8217;s church are all making a difference, but without the Government taking action their task will continue to be a heavy one.</p>
	<p pid="a.357.1/11">To sum up, my constituents are great, hard-working, big-hearted people who show every day the ethos of hard work and social responsibility, despite the onslaught of misery caused by this Government.</p>

Member for South Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck)</phrase>, as I have to many Opposition Members, but on the question of what we should do, I have not heard much. The honourable exception was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40468" name="Michael Meacher">the right hon. Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher)</phrase>, whose speech had some coherence, but I guess he is far too moderate to be included in the Labour party&#8217;s Government-in-waiting, assuming that position remains&#8212;we hold out that hope.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.2/2">The motion is a listing of some of the pain points that many of our constituents are feeling as they look to balance their budgets each week. &#8220;I feel your pain&#8221; is an important expression of empathy. Empathy is important for politicians of all parties; we have to be empathetic with the constituents we represent. However, empathy is no substitute for policy, and Opposition Members have shown a complete absence of policy in dealing with the points of pain that they can so lucidly set down in their motions. That is why I shall support the Government in the Division later.</p>
	<p pid="a.358.2/3">When we have seen a policy from the Opposition, it has often been about ways in which they would seek to intervene in markets. I suggest to Opposition Members</p>
	<p pid="a.358.2/4">that Government intervention should always be used sparingly and where it can be effective. The Leader of the Opposition has chosen as his flagship intervention policy one where he cannot be effective, and nor does it make economic sense. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40494" name="Ian Swales">the hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales)</phrase> pointed out, the consequence of the Labour party&#8217;s position on an energy price freeze has been to crater the willingness of energy companies to invest in effective energy in the long term. It is very sad that just a few weeks after the Chancellor had been to China to secure investment in our energy sector&#8212;something that the Labour Government sadly missed out on year after year&#8212;the Labour party came up with another policy designed to make our energy more inefficient, rather than efficient, in the long term. If we are going to address some of the issues about the cost of living for members of the public, we have to be honest about what the Government can and cannot do.</p>

	<p pid="a.359.7/1">I am answering the question. I know it is hard for the hon. Gentleman to follow the argument, but I will put it in bite-sized pieces so that he can keep up. It is important for a Chancellor of the Exchequer to</p>
	<p pid="a.359.7/2">look at not just the indebtedness of the Government, but at the way in which the entire economy is accumulating debt, which is one of the things that the previous Labour Government signally failed to understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.7/3">If we look at the United Kingdom&#8217;s debt in the mid-1990s and take into consideration Government debt, household debt and corporate debt, we will see that that total indebtedness was, like that of many other OECD countries, two times the size of our national economy. Over the intervening 15 years&#8212;which in this country were spent mostly under a Labour Government&#8212;other OECD countries saw their total debt go from about two times to about three times the size of their economy, and that includes all of the impact of the financial crisis. One country in the G8&#8212;and only one&#8212;increased its total debt from two times to five times the size of its economy, and that was the United Kingdom under the previous Labour Government. It is the consequence of that pervasive debt in the economy that is the real cost of living crisis in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.359.7/4">Every family knows that when they have significant debts that they cannot avoid and that they have to pay, their monthly income will be less because they will have to pay back the debt of the past.

	<p pid="a.360.1/1">I see that the shadow Chief Secretary has left for more education on economics. My hon. Friend raises a point about income levels. There is an issue about how we increase the incomes of people at the low end of our economy. How do we make sure that work pays for those people who go out and work very hard?</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/2">Over the past 10 years, the United Kingdom has created a massive level of state intervention to support wages at the low end of the income spectrum. In order to try to improve living standards for people at the low end, we have to encourage employers to somehow pay higher wages. References have been made to the living wage. One of the issues about changing people&#8217;s income from the minimum wage to the living wage is that the change to their take-home pay, including any benefits they receive, becomes a very small change in their net income level, because the tapering of benefits takes away nearly all the impact of the increase in wage rates. A change to the living wage is therefore a transaction involving additional cost to the employer and additional benefit for the Exchequer; it does not result in additional pay to the employee.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/3">We have to be clear about what we are truly promising people as we seek certain changes. It would be good to hear from my hon. Friend the Economic Secretary, who I presume will wind up the debate, what answer the Government can give people about their income and about making work pay. What are we doing about their tax and their benefits? For people in work who wish to take on additional hours or to increase their responsibilities and get more pay per hour, what are we doing to ensure that their benefits are not taken away so rapidly? If we</p>
	<p pid="a.360.1/4">do that, in the next period of Conservative Government we can continue the battle to make sure that work pays, which is the true answer to any cost of living crisis.</p>

	<p pid="a.361.5/1">I will not give way. Two hon. Members still want to speak, and I promised that I would not give way.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.5/2">I recently surveyed my constituents&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Government Members may want to chunter, but I would like them to listen, because it is about time that they educated themselves on how difficult this is for real people. I asked my constituents how they are managing their energy costs, which we know have risen by almost &#163;300, thanks to the inactivity of this Government. I was absolutely appalled to discover that 41% of respondents are spending more than 10% of their household income on heating their homes. That is fuel poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.5/3">The Prime Minister and his colleagues tell us that the answer is to switch suppliers. Well, 34% of my respondents told me that they had switched, but then found themselves paying more for their heating than they were saving. Most of the 66% who had not switched suppliers told me that that was not because they were happy with their current supplier, but because, &#8220;They&#8217;re all the same. I would end up paying more.&#8221; As for the Prime Minister&#8217;s advice on whether to wear a jumper, the response of 97% of my constituents was, &#8220;Wow, patronising or</p>
	<p pid="a.361.5/4">what?&#8221; I agree with them. His remarks encapsulate just how out of touch he is with the everyday lives of ordinary people in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.5/5">Many people told me how the rising cost of living is having a detrimental impact on their lives and those of their children. I was told, &#8220;In my household, we have to choose a room to heat and we all spend our time in that room.&#8221; How on earth do we expect young people to thrive academically in that environment, or even simply get the space to do their homework? I was told, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have the heating on as long as I&#8217;d like to, to save money&#8221;, and &#8220;We don&#8217;t heat our home until it&#8217;s nearly freezing inside.&#8221; Premature winter deaths soar in cold weather when people are not able to heat their homes. The most recent statistics show that Newham is ninth out of the 32 London boroughs for the number of excess winter deaths, despite it having the youngest population in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.5/6">Paying the heating bills is only one part of the cost of living crisis. In the year to March 2013, rents increased by 2.7% on average across the country. In Newham, rents increased by 15% in the same period. That is an average of &#163;135 more per month. Let us also put into the mix the lack of affordable child care, the difficulty in finding and holding on to employment, and the impact of zero-hours contracts on people&#8217;s ability to pay the rent. All those issues have become weekly or even daily concerns for people who live in Newham.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.5/7">Under this Government, the cost of nursery places has risen by 30%&#8212;five times faster than pay. How do the Government think hard-working people in my constituency and in the other constituencies we have heard about, who are often on the minimum wage and are living in expensive private sector accommodation, can afford that hike? What advice would they offer my constituents who are working long hours just to make ends meet and who are worried about decent, affordable child care for their families? How would they advise people in my constituency who are struggling to pay exorbitant rents, but are living in overcrowded and often substandard private sector housing? What would they tell the young person who is struggling to find a decent, full-time job? I will tell you, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.361.5/8">This Government offer empty platitudes. They are out of touch and have no clue what life is like for ordinary working families. They have allowed prices to rise faster than wages in 39 out of 40 months. And when was that halcyon month when wages rose more than prices? It was the month in which the bankers received their bonuses. Does that not tell us all we need to know about the Government? This Government put the wishes of the privileged before the needs of working people. Trust me, Mr Speaker, I could go on and on talking about the abhorrent impact that the cost of living crisis is having in my constituency. The only people who seem to be completely oblivious are the Members on the Government Benches. They care not about the consequences of their cavalier ignorance on the lives of ordinary people. Britain deserves better.</p>

I seem to remember that it hit 5.2% or thereabouts. Of course, the higher-than-predicted inflation was the only reason why the Government were able to boast about record increases in pensions.</p>

	<p pid="a.363.3/1">That stagnation is why so many of our constituents are suffering so much. I was astonished by some of the comments made this afternoon. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40298" name="Robert Halfon">The hon. Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon)</phrase> managed to suggest that unemployment was not down to the recession but down to the entire period of the Labour Government. In fact, when the global financial crisis hit in 2008, unemployment was a little over 5% at 1.6 million, but by the end of 2009 it had risen by 1 million to 2.5 million. The cause of that rising unemployment, so suddenly and over such a short period, was the economic recession, not the Labour Government. Such rewriting of history is constantly going on. Recently, however, that rewriting seems not just to be about what caused the recession, but tries to read back to the Labour Government and put things into that period that were not the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.3/2">The stock answer from the Government on what they have done to help people in the cost of living crisis is to talk about the increase in the tax threshold. The problem with that policy is that it unduly helps those who are already better off, and does not help those with the lowest income levels in our communities. Two thirds of the billions of pounds that have been spent on raising the tax threshold has gone to people in the top half of the income scale, because the policy benefits people on higher incomes as much&#8212;if not more&#8212;as those on lower incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.3/3">What has been the quid pro quo? There have been cuts to benefit payments and tax credits, which has cancelled out the rise in the tax threshold for those at the lower end of the income scale. Not only have those paying no tax not benefited, but those at the bottom end who have apparently benefited a little have had that</p>
	<p pid="a.363.3/4">cancelled out. That is what we must all remember. Those with the lowest earnings have not benefited from the policy. Both Government parties constantly say that the tax threshold is being raised because they want to help the lowest earners. In fact, that policy has not benefited the lowest earners, because in order to pay for it&#8212;it is very expensive&#8212;there have been constant cuts to people&#8217;s benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.363.3/5">At the extreme end, those who say there has been no change should look around their towns and cities. I have never seen so many quick lenders, payday lenders, and companies such as BrightHouse spring up in such a short period. It was not happening before. Food banks are new in my lifetime&#8212;they were something I read about in the history books of the 1930s. One of the Prime Minister&#8217;s favourite statements about food banks is, &#8220;But usage of food banks went up tenfold under a Labour Government.&#8221; The problem with that arithmetic is that 10 times a very small number is still a very small number&#8212;from 4,000 in 2005 when the Trussell Trust started up, to 40,000 in 2010. Last year, that figure rose to 347,000, and in the first six months of this year, it has risen to 350,000. That very big number is down to the policies of this Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.364.0/1">I will be brief, because time is short.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/2">I listened to the debate with interest. Hon. Members can throw punches from now until Christmas eve about who is to blame, but the reality is that hundreds of thousands of people in the United Kingdom&#8212;men, women and children&#8212;are in poverty. It is estimated that 31,000 senior citizens will die because of the lack of heat or food in their homes. That is a tragedy for any country and for this modern day United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/3">Electricity and gas prices, and water charges, are increasing. People are finding it hard to repay their mortgages and, as we heard, interest rates could go up. People are being hit by the bedroom tax&#8212;others will use different terminology. The banks are, and have been, ripping them off. Food banks are increasing. In my constituency, which, at 200 square miles, is not the biggest in the UK, food banks are starting to increase, which never happened before. We are sending millions of pounds per year to fill Strasbourg&#8217;s coffers so that people there can waste it on some outlandish project and prop up other countries that have gone into bankruptcy.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/4">Whenever the general public look at today&#8217;s debate, they will wonder what it is all about and ask, &#8220;Why should we bother to vote at all? We don&#8217;t seem to be getting much out of it.&#8221; I believe that, as elected Members, we should get closer to the general public and those who are going through serious poverty. It is a tragedy that people in this country have to choose between heating their homes or going out to buy their normal groceries.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/5">A major problem we will have in future is personal debt. How that will be solved or dealt with we do not know, but it must be addressed. Millions of people will be in that difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/6">Yes, vehicles are being exported to other countries. That is brilliant. Exports in general seem to be fairly good and moving forward, and business is looking fairly good, but the ordinary working class general public currently do not see the benefit of any of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.364.0/7">We talk about rebalancing the economy. I agree that we need to do that&#8212;it is imperative&#8212;but hon. Members have been sent to the House to represent the people of the United Kingdom. It is important that we look at rebalancing the lives of the people who sent us here.</p>

	<p pid="a.365.0/1">The most recent GDP figures suggest that our economy might finally have started to turn a corner, which everybody, especially the Opposition, welcomes. We have had three years of flatlining growth under this Government. How much damage has that economic stagnation done? How long will it take the country, families and businesses to recover from a starting point that is so much lower than was promised back in 2010?</p>
	<p pid="a.365.0/2">The Opposition motion states that</p>
	<p pid="a.365.0/3">&#8220;growth of 1.5% is needed in every quarter between now and May 2015&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.365.0/4">just to catch up on the ground that has been lost. Stagnation and no-to-low growth means that the Chancellor&#8217;s much hailed deficit reduction plan has been a failure, with borrowing rising&#8212;the coalition is set to borrow &#163;200 billion more than it planned in autumn 2010. Will we get an explanation for that? That failure&#8212;the slowest recovery in 100 years&#8212;means that the Prime Minister and the Chancellor do not have a chance of meeting their promises to balance the books by 2015.</p>

	<p pid="a.365.6/1">There are some inconvenient truths for Government Members. Personal debt has increased on their watch by 33% in my constituency and by a significant number in the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.6/2">Hon. Members are keen to refer to the previous Government&#8217;s borrowing figures. As of last week, the coalition Government have borrowed more in three years than the Labour Government did in 13 years of government&#8212;that is the reality. On every economic test, and on the test the Prime Minister and the Chancellor set for themselves, they have failed palpably. It is clear from the many contributions to the debate that the recovery, which appears to be taking place, has yet to touch the lives of millions of people, contrary to the</p>
	<p pid="a.365.6/3">impression given by Government Members. My concern is that things will get a whole lot worse before people see any signs of them getting better.</p>
	<p pid="a.365.6/4">Any economic recovery needs to deliver rising standards for all, not just for the Prime Minister, the Chancellor and their friends at the top. We need a recovery that is balanced and built to last. Critically, it needs to benefit every corner and community in the country. Instead, the Government, and the Government Members who support them, continue to bury their heads in the sand. They remain oblivious to the living crisis experienced by millions of families, or, worse, they deny what they hear and see with their own eyes. It is the same old Tory party, aided and abetted by the Liberal Democrats. They are totally out of touch with the reality of life for so many in Britain today who find themselves increasingly out of pocket and increasingly in debt.</p>

	<p pid="a.366.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is obsessed with statistics and keen to detract from the truth, which is that it is this Government who are borrowing &#163;200 billion more than they planned. They have failed to reduce the deficit in the past three years to even a fraction of what they promised back in 2010. It is his Government&#8217;s plans that have failed. He should wake up to that fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.1/2">I go back to the people who are paying the price. There is the single dad in my constituency who, to pay for the bedroom tax for the room he keeps for his children to stay in, eats barely anything all week and saves the money to buy food for his children at the weekend. The Chancellor would probably call that thrift. There is the GP and his staff who hand out, from their own pockets, the money for patients to get the bus to the local food bank. The Prime Minister would probably call that the big society in action. There is the branch of a well known bank on the outskirts of Newcastle, where 80% of customers have only the most basic bank account. It has young mums coming in on a daily basis in tears because they cannot manage to feed their children and heat their homes. Citizens advice bureaux across the country saw a 78% increase in the number of people inquiring about food banks between February and June this year alone&#8212;little wonder, when gas and electricity bills have risen by an average of &#163;300 a year on the Prime Minister&#8217;s watch. Households are spending 12% more on food bills than they were in 2007, despite purchasing 4.2% less food, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40688" name="Iain McKenzie">the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie)</phrase> pointed out.</p>

	<p pid="a.366.3/1">I would like to give way, but I really must make progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/2">Let us cast our minds back briefly to 2010 and the Conservatives&#8217; general election manifesto. They have attempted to wipe many previous pledges from their website and from the public&#8217;s memory, but I am afraid they cannot hide the blatant pledges printed in their manifesto. On page 8 it stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/3">&#8220;We want to see an economy where not just our standard of living, but everyone&#8217;s quality of life, rises steadily and sustainably.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/4">What about the Liberal Democrats? We know that their manifesto needs to be taken with a very large handful of salt. They stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/5">&#8220;Liberal Democrats want to make the tax and benefits system fair, so that everyone, be they young or old, can afford to get by.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/6">They said that Britain was</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/7">&#8220;one of the most unequal societies in the developed world, where ordinary people struggle to make ends meet while the richest benefit from tax breaks.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/8">Well, we know who voted through the biggest tax break for top earners as soon as they got into power.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/9">On the back of those election promises, what is the coalition&#8217;s record on living standards three and a half years into government? Under this Government, this Prime Minister, this Chancellor, this Deputy Prime Minister and this Chief Secretary, who is not here today, prices have risen faster than wages for 40 of the last 41 months. According to a report published by the TUC over the summer, of all the jobs created since June 2010, four out of five&#8212;80%&#8212;have been in low-paid industries. The stark reality is that average earnings have fallen in every region and nation of the UK on this Government&#8217;s watch. Indeed, the Prime Minister already has the worst record on living standards&#8212;none of his predecessors comes close to matching his singular failure on the issue. He is a record-breaking Prime Minister with a record-breaking Chancellor, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> put it so eloquently.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/10">Let us just remind ourselves, particularly the Liberal Democrat Members previously so concerned about ordinary people struggling</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/11">&#8220;to make ends meet while the richest benefit from tax breaks&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/12">when the one blip in the Prime Minister&#8217;s dismal 40-month record was. In which one month of the last 41 did we see average wages rise faster than prices? Yes, it was April this year, when financial services firms deferred paying up to &#163;1.7 billion in bonuses so that their staff could benefit from the 50p tax cut. At a time when average earnings for working people have fallen by &#163;1,600 in real terms since May 2010, we have a Government who believed that it was right to prioritise giving a whopping tax cut to the highest earners in the country. At a time when almost 1 million young people are out of work, when long-term unemployment remains dangerously high and when the number of part-time workers wanting full-time hours stands at a record 1.5 million&#8212;another record for this Government&#8212;we have a Chancellor devoting his time and attention to taking legal action against the EU&#8217;s attempts to limit bankers&#8217; bonuses to just one year&#8217;s salary. At a time when people are facing a genuine cost of living crisis, in the face of ever-increasing household bills and diminishing earnings, we have a Prime Minister who seems happy to sit on his hands and do nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/13">Only today, figures released by the Money Advice Service show that nearly 9 million people across the UK are living with serious debt problems. Staggeringly, 18% of Britons&#8212;8.8 million people&#8212;consider themselves to have &#8220;serious&#8221; financial issues. Many hon. Friends raised those issues on behalf of their constituents, including</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/14">my hon. Friends the Members for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue), for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods) and for Inverclyde, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40468" name="Michael Meacher">the Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher)</phrase> and my hon. Friends the Members for Cardiff South and Penarth (Stephen Doughty), for South Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck), for West Ham (Lyn Brown) and for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore). We heard none of that concern from the Government Benches. We have a Prime Minister who is clearly happy to let ordinary people pay the price for his economic failure and that of his Chancellor. They are the people who, in the words of my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister will never meet and whose lives he will never understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/15">What could the Government be doing about this crisis? It is all about priorities. With the cold winter months now upon us, it is time to stand up for hard-pressed families by supporting our energy prize freeze. It is time to do something about the staggering rise in the cost of child care&#8212;up 30% under this Government&#8212;which is preventing people from getting to work. It is time to do something about housing and to ensure that as well as helping people to buy we help people to build. We also need to do something about unemployment and bring forward the compulsory jobs guarantee.</p>
	<p pid="a.366.3/16">It is clear that the Government&#8217;s policies have failed on their own terms. On living standards, economic growth and the deficit, the Government have completely failed to meet the goals they set themselves in 2010. The Opposition believe that there are specific, urgent and costed measures that the Chancellor could take in the autumn statement next week to help hard-pressed families and small businesses. The Opposition call on the Government and the Chancellor to wake up to reality and do just that. I recommend our motion to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.368.0/1">I thank the 19 hon. Members, on both sides of the House, who have taken part in this afternoon&#8217;s debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/2">It is said that the first step to recovery is admitting you have a problem, and the Opposition had a chance to admit they had a problem this afternoon. This debate has revealed the lack of an economic plan from Labour and the cost of a potential Labour Government. It is clear from what he said that the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury does not know the difference between a debt and a deficit. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase> talked about household debt. She might like to know that household debt, as a proportion of income, was 100% in 1997, grew to 150% by 2007 and was 170% by the first quarter of 2008, but has now fallen by 30 percentage points to 141%, as of the first quarter of 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/3">Another falsehood spread this afternoon was that the Government had borrowed more in three years than the last Government borrowed in 13 years. Labour increased public sector net debt by &#163;488 billion during their term in office, but the debt this Parliament has increased by &#163;360 billion. The shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury talked about record breaking. If he wants to talk about record breaking, how about talking about the record-breaking deficit that his Government left us? What about the broken promise of no more boom and bust.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/4">Remember that one? We do not hear that any more. The only honest statement we have heard from a Labour MP was from the former Chief Secretary to the Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40083" name="Liam Byrne">the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne)</phrase>, who left a note saying, &#8220;There&#8217;s no money left&#8221;. He could not have been more right.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.0/5">So what is missing from the motion today? There is no mention of the jobs created by this Government, of the 2.7 million people taken out of income tax, of the council tax freeze, of fuel duty cuts, of the deficit falling by a third, of inflation falling or of employment being at an all-time high.</p>

	<p pid="a.369.0/1">Does my hon. Friend not think it strange that the Opposition, who say they care about the cost of living crisis, voted against cutting taxes for lower earners and raising the threshold? Far from paying for those tax cuts for lower earners through other cuts, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" name="Sheila Gilmore">the hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore)</phrase> said, have we not raised taxes on the rich by increasing the capital allowance from 18% to 28%?</p>

	<p pid="a.369.1/1">My hon. Friend is indeed right. I wanted to come to his speech, because he started by talking rightly about fuel duty and the wonderful campaign he has launched to ensure that households are not spending as much as planned under the last Labour Government. I heard his plea for a further cut. I take note, but I make no promises.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/2">We then heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40111" name="Brooks Newmark">the Member for Braintree (Mr Newmark)</phrase>, who gave a characteristically positive speech. I note that unemployment in his constituency, including youth unemployment, is down by 20%, which is definitely something to be recognised. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40567" name="Kwasi Kwarteng">the Member for Spelthorne (Kwasi Kwarteng)</phrase> rightly talked about the recovering economy and about how debt had become endemic under the last Government. He is, of course, absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40598" name="Christopher Pincher">the Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher)</phrase> coined a new phrase that I hope will spread across the Twittersphere and beyond about geeks bearing gifts. I wonder whether he would agree with Charles Clarke, the former Home Secretary, who said of Labour&#8217;s energy policy: &#8220;My criticism of that particular proposal is I think it is a one-off effort that does not deal with the overall comprehensive issue we have to address. I think there is even a case that some of the recent price rises we have seen might have been a response to the suggestion of a freeze&#8221;. That is absolutely correct.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.1/4">We heard a wonderful speech from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase>, who talked about apprenticeships, noting the move from 430 to 690 apprentices over the last year. He is absolutely right that for 13 years the last Labour Government failed to tackle the lack of skills necessary for our economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.369.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Unsurprisingly, we did not hear that from Labour Members.</p>

	<p pid="a.370.1/1">I am not going to give way to the hon. Lady, because she did not give way to anyone during her speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/2">My hon. Friends the Members for Elmet and Rothwell (Alec Shelbrooke) and for Bedford (Richard Fuller) talked about work being the key to recovery, the need to create more jobs and making work pay, which is a critical part of our welfare reforms.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/3">We heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40384" name="Yvonne Fovargue">the hon. Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue)</phrase>, who talked about breaking the stranglehold of the big six. It was the last Labour Government who left us with the big six; we started with more and ended up with six.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.1/4">I listened carefully to the speeches of the hon.

Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher)</phrase>, and of the hon. Members for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore), for West Ham (Lyn Brown) and for South Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck). What struck me most&#8212;I have referred to it before in this place&#8212;was the collective amnesia and total lack of understanding among Labour Members of how we ended up with the largest deficit since the second world war, which this Government have tackled by taking tough and difficult decisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.370.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a characteristically colourful intervention and speaks wonderfully, as always.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40174" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">The hon. Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods)</phrase> made a point about child care and called for action from this Government. This Government are taking action on that matter, with tax-free child care, increased provision for two-year-olds and increased provision for three and four-year-olds. I would have thought that the hon. Lady welcomed that. I noted her welcome of this week&#8217;s announcement on payday lenders by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/3">I noted the confession from the right hon. Member for Oldham West and Royton when he said that the problems did not start with this Government. He is absolutely right about that, but that was the only thing with which I could agree in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40692" name="Stephen Doughty">The hon. Member for Cardiff South and Penarth (Stephen Doughty)</phrase> talked about being on the side of Welsh people. In that case, I am sure he would welcome the 4,560 people in his constituency who have been taken out of income tax entirely since this Government&#8217;s changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.370.3/5">The only way to deliver sustained improvement in living standards is to take the difficult decisions that this Government have taken to tackle the economy&#8217;s problems head-on, delivering a sustainable, long-term recovery for all. The Labour party has demonstrated comprehensively today that it is not up to taking those decisions. I therefore ask the House to reject this motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.376.2/1">It is a pleasure to lead this debate on administration and insolvency. It is worth mentioning that the empty green Benches are a reflection not of the relevance or importance of the issue but of the incredibly busy lives that most parliamentarians lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.2/2">The purpose of the debate is to try to persuade the Minister that there should be a</p>
	<p pid="a.376.2/3">&#8220;mandatory requirement for licensed insolvency practitioners to give greater consideration to the social consequences of companies in administration&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.376.2/4">rather than the current situation where perfectly viable businesses are simply sold to the highest bidder to be disassembled, with their assets flogged off and their work forces devastated.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.2/5">The Minister will be aware that I met the Secretary of State to discuss this very issue. I fully appreciate that administrators are under a legal duty to ensure that they get a maximum return for creditors, but there is little, if any, cognisance of the detrimental effect that that can have on the very survival of a company if other factors are not explored, often with a resultant effect on a local community or a negative impact on UK plc. In other words, administrators almost invariably accept the highest bid, which is not always the best bid.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.2/6">Before I begin my speech in earnest, I should like to place on record my thanks to both the Secretary of State and the shadow Secretary of State for their co-operation in September when I contacted them in a desperate attempt to save as many jobs as possible when Trigon Snacks in my constituency went into administration.</p>

	<p pid="a.376.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. Before the debate, I received his permission to intervene. Does he think that in the first year of trading, before a business gets into difficulties, the Government or the Minister could give them some indication of what to do when it comes to banks, regulations, skills and rates? Those four things are so critical in the first year of any business to ensure that it gets a second and a third year and that it stops insolvency.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-27a.376.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40371" speakername="Steve Rotheram" colnum="376"  time="019:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131127/debtext/131127-0004.htm#131127-0004.htm_spnew29">
	<p pid="a.376.4/1">I am certain that those four factors are important, but start-up credit is a major impediment to the long-term success of smaller, micro-businesses. One in six small and medium-sized enterprises goes bust in the UK. In 2011-12, something like 120 SMEs per day were going into administration or liquidation. Anything that Parliament can do to assist those businesses to grow and to take on additional staff can only benefit the country as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/2">I also want to put on record my thanks to Unite the Union, which, despite the Prime Minister&#8217;s constant jibing, works tirelessly to support its members and which was as determined as I was to see production remain in Liverpool. I know the Minister and her Department are aware of this case, and it is this recent episode on which I wish to focus much of my contribution tonight as it clearly illustrates the issue at hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/3">Trigon Snacks was a nut production factory with an annual turnover of approximately &#163;30 million. The company produced peanuts for pub favourite brands such as Big D and Planters, and the business had profitable contracts with a number of large supermarket chains.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/4">Following the company&#8217;s success at winning an increased order book with Sainsbury&#8217;s, Trigon doubled its production, introducing new shift patterns for the work force. That resulted in negotiations between management and the union to reward staff with a pay rise, which they had forgone for many years to secure the viability of the company. Indeed, some of the loyal work force had given more than 30 years of service to Trigon. Everything in the garden looked rosy.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/5">To meet the new targets, Trigon stepped up production but soon encountered cash-flow problems, due to the purchase of extra plant, material, raw stock and associated manufacturing costs. To meet that short-term liquidity problem, Trigon approached the Royal Bank of Scotland for a loan totalling approximately &#163;1.2 million. Given the developments this week with RBS, this might be another case that requires further scrutiny from the Secretary of State as it is clear that, for whatever reason, the company, despite being profitable, was not awarded the loan. When that loan could not be guaranteed, the business was destined to fail. RBS&#8217;s decision came in August and just a month later the business was put into administration. It is also worth noting that at the time of entering administration the company&#8217;s stock value alone was &#163;2.7 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/6">Disgracefully, 64 members of staff were handed immediate redundancy notices without prior warning, consultation with their trade union officers or even the courtesy of the administrator&#8217;s writing to me as the local MP. That still rankles with those who lost their jobs. Those employees had given decades of service and yet they were called to the works cafeteria for a routine meeting, had their names read out and were then told not only that they were losing their jobs but that they had to go promptly to clear their desks and lockers before being escorted from the premises by security guards who had been hired specifically to oversee that draconian act.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/7">Having met Unite officials and staff at the factory immediately after the redundancies were announced, I became aware that numerous cases of unfair dismissal were set to be lodged alongside claims for protective awards by the union. Many of those shown the door have found it extremely difficult to find alternative employment despite being skilled factory workers with a wealth of experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/8">I should make it clear that I am not suggesting the administrators did anything illegal, but I believe it was certainly unethical and I told them so. It remains likely that Unite will seek 30 days&#8217; pay for its members through protective awards, a cost that is likely to be borne by the Exchequer. However, once Trigon was in administration only two outcomes were likely. First, the administrator could look to keep the business operational by selling it as a going concern. Although that would not absolutely guarantee the future of the business, it was hoped that those who bought the going concern would maintain production at the site, look to restructure the business, re-launch the brand and invest in improvements. There was another option: it would result in the administrator accepting a bid from a company</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/9">that would close the factory, sell the stock, plant and machinery, transfer production to another site and make the whole work force redundant. In other words, the fear was that an asset stripper would decimate the business for a quick profit.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/10">In the case of Trigon, despite my best efforts and those of Unite it looked likely that the doomsday scenario would be the most probable outcome and that the administrators, Duff and Phelps, would complete a sale that would maximise a better return for creditors but that would inevitably result in the loss of production at the Liverpool factory.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/11">That is where I think that the balance is all wrong. I know that the closure of any factory is a tragedy for that particular business and work force, but when it makes no economic sense it is even harder for those facing redundancy to accept. When the result also lands the Treasury with a hefty bill for workers&#8217; redundancy payments and increased benefit bills&#8212;not to mention the devastation to the local jobs market, the loss of business rates and the blight of a large empty factory&#8212;questions need to be asked. I believe that the need to ensure that administrators take greater control of the social impact of the bids they accept is now even greater.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/12">The cold reality is that none of those factors could, in law, be taken into consideration by the administrators, and I believe that that is fundamentally wrong and needs to change. Some people may argue that administrators indirectly take all those factors into consideration as they look to keep businesses alive as going concerns, but they do not have a mandatory requirement to consider the social consequences. The law only directs them to make the biggest return for creditors, no matter what the consequences might be for communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/13">At the end of the day, the potential to asset-strip the Walton factory collapsed, as only one bid remained, which set out to retain production locally, and this is where I do give some credit to the administrators for working with myself and the Unite union throughout the evening to secure a deal as a going concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/14">We were lucky. The Trigon factory was saved. It still exists today, in the guise of a new company called Natco, but minus the 60-odd staff originally sacked. I have not given up hope of restoring the work force to its full complement, and getting those workers who were wrongly dismissed back on site. I know that many of them are facing a bleak Christmas for the first time in 30 or 40 years, through absolutely no fault of their own, with, yes, the fiscal costs borne by the state, but the human cost is much more difficult to measure. All that is because the initial shortfall loan could not be agreed with the banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/15">I am aware that when it comes to the process of administration, nothing about what I have described is extraordinary, or dissimilar to the experiences of many others in this place. This is where I believe that reform should be considered, even though I appreciate that it is a complex area of law. The primary legislation governing insolvency is the Insolvency Act 1986. As the Minister is no doubt aware, the last Labour Government radically reformed legislation in this area to modify insolvency laws through the Enterprise Act 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/16">The raison d&#8217;&#234;tre of our reforms was as PricewaterhouseCoopers explains:</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/17">&#8220;The Government&#8217;s intention was to create a shift in insolvency culture, with a greater emphasis placed on company rescue and rehabilitation, fairness for all creditors and making it tougher for offending directors&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/18">Those reforms achieved a great deal. Indeed, as PWC went on to say, the</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/19">&#8220;insolvency landscape transformed; administrations have now largely replaced administrative receiverships as the primary insolvency procedure, and many businesses have been preserved via this route. Furthermore, other solutions have evolved to facilitate the turnaround, restructuring and rescue of businesses&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/20">So progress can be made&#8212;it has already been made&#8212;to change the culture within this field and I am sure that this kind of independent analysis is welcomed across the House. But now I think it is time to go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/21">In the list of responsibilities laid down on licensed insolvency practitioners we need a further mandatory requirement that consideration should be given to the social consequences of every bid they receive and, critically, that they should have the ability to award a sale of the asset that offers the most protection for staff, local communities and the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.376.4/22">My contention is that greater consideration is needed of the impact on the public purse and our manufacturing capabilities. It seems nonsensical to me that greater consideration is not given to the impact that insolvency has on the Exchequer&#8212;and, equally importantly, the area in which the closure is proposed. I am not suggesting that those two factors should be exclusive, or that they should be given pre-eminence in deliberations, but there must be some reflection of the wider social impacts of each bid. I am acutely aware that this will not always ensure that asset-strippers are not awarded businesses. I am also aware that it will not always ensure that British workers stay in work and that their jobs will not just be exported overseas once the sale is completed.</p>

	<p pid="a.379.1/1">I could not agree more with my hon. Friend, because that is exactly the scenario that I am painting with this company. Trigon was a viable, profitable company with a short-term cash-flow problem that could not get a bail-out from the banks, which, we should not forget, are owned by the people of this country, who rely on those companies to provide them with suitable jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.1/2">We must ensure that there is a chance, as in the case of Trigon, where a factory was at the heart of one of the most economically deprived areas in the UK&#8212;that is true of Liverpool, Walton and there are areas of social deprivation in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency too&#8212;that other bids are considered that would keep people in work and maintain UK production.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.1/3">Liverpool city council has been successful in attracting new industries to our city. In north Liverpool, we continue</p>
	<p pid="a.379.1/4">to work to attract inward investment and businesses, and do all that we can to ensure that our workers are in full-time employment, but that is incongruous if the net result is that we haemorrhage jobs from profitable companies, which we give to asset strippers to break up, and sell brand names for products that are manufactured abroad, then import the same products back into the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.1/1">The Secretary of State and the Department&#8212;I spoke to some officials&#8212;were as helpful as they possibly could be. If we had had a longer lead-in period or the company was in administration for a longer period there might well have been investment or pots of money&#8212;local enterprise partnership moneys, for instance, or regional growth moneys&#8212;that could have been used. Unfortunately, things happened very quickly and it was not possible to access moneys to ensure that the shortfall of &#163;1.2 million was covered.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.1/2">If the Minister is not willing to hear my request for a mandatory requirement for administrators to consider the social consequences of each bid, will she not consider the requirement in regard to the consequences for UK industries? That is not protectionism but pragmatism. We simply cannot afford to do nothing and watch good British businesses suffer. For instance, since the global financial crisis, the impact on the retail industry has been severe. According to the Centre for Retail Research in Nottingham, in its update entitled &#8220;Who&#8217;s Gone Bust in Retail 2010-13&#8221;, since the global financial crash, 249 medium and large-sized retail businesses have failed financially, affecting more than 22,100 stores and close to 250,000 employees. We all know the names of those companies&#8212;most of them are household names, but they have become infamous for going out of business.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.1/3">Not all of those companies were profit-making enterprises in the way Trigon was, but undoubtedly some businesses were wound up that produced a short-term return for asset strippers but that, in the long term, could have been kept alive, and there was no consideration of the long-term social consequences for everyone affected by closure. In other words, I contend that some creditors will have done well out of these administrations, but the workers, the local communities and the economics of the area will have suffered most from their failure, and we must do more to protect society and British industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.1/4">In conclusion, I expect that the Minister might try to explain that this is a very complex area of law and that it would be difficult to introduce changes as there would undoubtedly be knock-on consequences. I do genuinely understand the problems of best intentions&#8212;I spoke to the Secretary of State about this&#8212;and the law of unintended consequences, but I am sure the hon. Lady will agree that it would be wrong not to look at what could be done to improve current legislation. The status quo is not good enough.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40371" name="Steve Rotheram">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram)</phrase> on securing the debate, and, if I may say so, on his</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/2">rather fantastic contribution to Movember. As we are now nearing the end of that month, I implore him, perhaps on behalf of other hon. Members, not to get the razor out on Sunday so that we can continue to enjoy his fine moustache. What a fantastic cause to raise money for.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/3">I recognise the interest that the hon. Gentleman has shown in insolvency issues, and in particular his concerns about the impact that insolvency has on local communities when jobs are unfortunately lost. He outlined particularly eloquently the human cost that is paid by those involved in such businesses when they unfortunately enter insolvency. This is especially keenly felt in the run-up to Christmas. In the example he talked about, Trigon Snacks, those 64 individuals are in a very difficult situation, having, sadly, lost their jobs. I extend my full sympathies to those individuals and their families.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/4">I recognise the efforts and discussions that the hon. Gentleman has had with the administrators and the union in this case. He was right to highlight the positive role that unions can play in such situations. It is all too easy for unions to be demonised in industrial relations, with headlines that tend to focus on circumstances where industrial relations break down and are negative, whereas the day-to-day experience is often of a much more positive and constructive working relationship, helping to create future success for a business that is going through difficulty. Although clearly for the 64 individuals who have lost their jobs there is a heavy price to pay, it is worth noting the success of at least making sure that 110 of those 174 jobs have been saved as a result of the business being sold as a going concern. The input of dedicated constituency Members of Parliament in such cases is not to be underestimated and is cause for congratulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/5">I understand the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s concerns about some of the practices surrounding administration, and I will try to set out what the Government are doing to address some of them. He said that the social consequences should be explicitly recognised in the objectives of administrators, and he rightly highlighted concerns where it is the case, or sometimes the perception, that a company is asset-stripped and sold off to the highest bidder without any apparent concern for the wider consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/6">I would like to provide reassurance by going through the hierarchy of objectives for administrators. The top priority that they have to bear in mind is business rescue&#8212;to rescue a financially troubled company as a going concern. That is well aligned with the wider social objectives that the hon. Gentleman seeks to promote, including the interests of employees and other stakeholders. Generally, the best way of making sure that creditors can be paid and jobs can be saved is to ensure that the business can continue as a going concern. If that is not possible, the administrator is required to achieve a better result for the creditors of the company as a whole than would be achieved in an immediate winding-up. Only if neither of those things is possible is it their duty to realise the property and the assets for the benefit of the secured or preferential creditors. We have a system that places priority on business rescue, which is incredibly important and ultimately the best way to secure the jobs of the individuals who are working for a company.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/7">Regrettably, to have a chance of rescuing a failed company, urgent and robust action sometimes needs to</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/8">be taken to restructure and to reduce costs. That does not necessarily mean that it is the fault of the administration procedure per se; it may be a reflection of the economic reality of a company that cannot meet its obligations. Thankfully, the number of administrations and liquidations has been on a downward trend in recent years. In the 12 months that ended in the third quarter of this year, there were 2,303 administrations, which is about 300 fewer than in the previous 12 months, and the number of liquidations was about 8% lower over the same period.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/9">The hon. Gentleman and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40522" name="Bill Esterson">the hon. Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)</phrase> asked about the behaviour of the banks. This is not only about what happens when an administration procedure is reached but what we can do to prevent businesses from getting into this situation in the first place. The hon. Gentleman outlined the scenario of Trigon Snacks, where so much stemmed from the declining of a request for a loan. I am sure he will understand that I cannot necessarily comment on the specifics of that loan application, but this is an issue on which we share some general concerns. In fact, this week the BIS entrepreneur-in-residence, Lawrence Tomlinson, published a report in which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has taken a great interest and has referred to the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, which looks at the role of banks particularly in relation to the support they give to business. The report focuses on significant concerns about the conduct of the Royal Bank of Scotland. We are looking carefully at the evidence in the report to see whether further issues need to be raised within the regulatory bodies regarding insolvency practitioners and whether any legislative framework issues need to be addressed in relation to the behaviour of banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/10">Generally speaking, our insolvency regime is highly regarded internationally. A recent World Bank report rated it seventh&#8212;above those of the US, Germany and France&#8212;on resolving insolvency. That is partly a reflection of the flexibility of our regime for prioritising business rescue, which helps to preserve value and jobs. That focus, rather than any specific obligation to consider particular affected parties over others, helps to balance everyone&#8217;s interests and to create a better business environment, which improves the prospects for preserving these jobs in the long term. However, I absolutely recognise the concerns that the hon. Gentleman raises about this case and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/11">Let me turn briefly to some of the other issues raised about insolvency. On the effectiveness of the regulatory regime, we believe that stronger oversight powers would help to improve confidence in it. We will therefore introduce proposals, when we can find time in the legislative programme, to strengthen the powers of the Secretary of State as oversight regulator.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/12">Concerns have been expressed about the pre-pack administration process, particularly where there are sales back to connected parties. In the light of these concerns, I announced in July that Teresa Graham had been appointed to undertake an independent review of the pre-pack procedure, which we expect to be completed by the spring next year. There have also been changes to introduce a revised practice standard for pre-packs, known as SIP16, which is now in place. The complaints mechanism has been streamlined, with a new single</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/13">complaints gateway to help to make the complex array of regulatory bodies easier to complain about.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/14">The issue of fees charged by insolvency practitioners has been raised. Professor Elaine Kempson recently provided a review of fees that was published earlier this year, and we intend to make an announcement on the way forward in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/15">The hon. Gentleman said that in recent years significant progress has been made on insolvency to improve the</p>
	<p pid="a.380.2/16">situation. I hope that he is reassured that this Government are very aware of the issues he raises and are taking action on a number of fronts to make further progress in various areas to ensure that all insolvency procedures can deliver the best possible outcomes in difficult circumstances&#8212;</p>
