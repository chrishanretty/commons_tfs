	<p pid="b.869.7/3">Those recent improvements in rail franchising have resulted in passenger journey numbers in this country going up from 750 million to 1.5 billion and people using our railways a lot more, with a huge amount of investment guaranteed by this Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.870.3/1">I have used East Coast trains on a number of occasions and have talked to the staff operating the service. The hon.

	<p pid="b.870.5/1">The hon. Lady might just have welcomed the fact that for the first time in 10 years we have got rid of above-inflation rail ticket price increases. I would have thought that she might have welcomed that, because I am very proud that for the first time in 10 years this coalition Government have held rail fare increases down in line with the retail prices index.</p>

	<p pid="b.870.6/1">The right hon. Gentleman talks about the autumn statement but it is his decision not to remove the &#8220;flex&#8221; on fares, which means some commuter tickets could still rise by 5.1% next year. In 13 days people will buy their annual season tickets, yet they have no idea how much they will cost. That is completely unacceptable. Is not the example set by East Coast another reason that it should be kept as a public sector comparator?</p>

	<p pid="b.870.7/1">The simple fact is that the reduction in rail fares announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in the autumn statement has been widely welcomed by various organisations including Transport 2000, and I am very proud that we have managed to do</p>
	<p pid="b.870.7/2">something. The hon. Lady mentions the &#8220;flex&#8221;. We have reduced the extent to which the &#8220;flex&#8221; can be exercised, which the last Government never did.</p>

	<p pid="b.871.5/1">May I draw to the Minister&#8217;s attention the bizarre situation that has arisen in respect of the Todmorden curve in east Lancashire? After years of campaigning, work on the curve has been completed at a cost of &#163;8 million, and we all welcome that. It will facilitate a service from Blackburn, Accrington and Burnley through Rochdale to Manchester Victoria, which is excellent. The problem is that there are no trains.

	<p pid="b.871.7/1">The branch line from Kettering to Corby that was introduced a few years ago has been hugely welcome, but a negative knock-on effect is that the service on the main line going north from Kettering has been cut from a half-hourly service to an hourly service.

The project currently assumes that the cost of HS2 is to be funded by the public purse. However, my Department is exploring the scope to draw in third-party funding to lessen the cost exposure to the taxpayer.</p>

	<p pid="b.872.6/1">Mr Speaker, I wish you and the Secretary of State a very happy Christmas. The Secretary of State could of course give both our constituencies an early Christmas present by cancelling HS2, but I do not suppose that that is on the drawing board. If everything in the garden is so rosy in regard to the finances, why does he feel it necessary to continue to suppress the Major Projects Authority reports on the risks associated with the project? Suppressing those reports does not send out a very good message to people about the project, whether they are for it or against it. In the absence of any response to my questions about this from the Cabinet Office Minister, will the Secretary of State tell the House what his intentions are in regard to the reports? Will he confirm or deny that he is continuing to try to prevent their publication?</p>

	<p pid="b.872.7/1">The one thing that HS2 is not short of is reports from various committees, either of this House or across the wider spectrum. The simple fact is that the report my right hon. Friend refers to is one direct to Ministers, and it is not usual to publish such</p>

May I encourage him not only to lighten up a bit, but to lighten up all of us who want investment in housing, hospitals, health and schools by scrapping this expensive extravagance and joining the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, who this morning has said that London is &#8220;draining the life&#8221; out of the regions of this country and that HS2 will speed up that process?</p>

	<p pid="b.873.1/1">I do not know about needing to lighten up&#8212;I think the hon. Gentleman should look in a mirror. The simple point is that we are not short at all of investment in the railways. In the next five years&#8212;its next control period&#8212;Network Rail will invest &#163;38 billion in the current railway system. It is vital that we get connectivity between our major cities. I have to say that some of the biggest supporters of HS2 are the northern leaders.

	<p pid="b.876.1/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for all his work in helping me with these projects. He is right about the benefits. The Jubilee line extension did not have a very good benefit-cost ratio, but if it had not been built, neither would have all the developments at Canary Wharf, so there is a lot to be said for the wider economic benefits we will get from this new railway line.</p>

	<p pid="b.877.0/1">My hon. Friend is right that the Access for All programme provided a footbridge and two lifts at Gloucester station, costing &#163;1.7 million. That is a small but important way in which we can help some of the older stations to be maintained and to be available for all people to access. We are seeing a major regeneration of our stations. Some of our major stations are now destinations in their own right. St Pancras station, for example, used to be a place where people did not want to spend more than five minutes, but it is now a destination in its own right.</p>

In the summer, which, as he pointed out, is the busiest time, staffing was at unsafe levels in 142 out of 184 shifts.

As we have now been able to secure a deal with the Treasury, we expect retention rates of coastguards applying for new posts to go up in January.

But, oh dear, cannot he see what a sorry tale of complacency and badly executed change this coastguard saga is? Does he feel happy with vacancies up by over 250% since 2010, poor morale, recruitment and transfer rates, a critical Select Committee report, and coastguard centres at Liverpool, Humber and Belfast all over a third below safe staffing levels? With more closures in the new year, will he get his Department cracking with an urgent action plan to ensure proper staffing levels so that our coastguards and those who live on our coastlines can feel safe and secure?</p>

	<p pid="b.880.4/1">I am grateful to the Minister for his reply. Lewisham commuters are very keen to reap direct benefits from the new franchise and infrastructure programme through increased train frequency and capacity. Many people share the aspiration of having four trains per hour on the Catford loop. Can the service specification for the new franchise be changed at this late stage, and could such a service be accommodated without detriment to other Lewisham services?</p>

That will be supplemented by additional standards and services under the Southeastern franchise, at least in peak periods. The detailed specification for those additional services will be determined nearer the time.</p>

There will be a huge amount of tunnelling in her constituency, which will cost more money. Sir David Higgins is a well respected engineer and has been a leader of great projects in our country, including the Olympics, which were delivered on time and below budget. I am sure that when he takes up this post, he will bring that expertise to the job.</p>

	<p pid="b.893.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business for the first week back in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.893.3/2">It has been reported that the Prime Minister told the 1922 committee yesterday that he is ready to take the extremely rare step of using the Parliament Acts to ensure that a Back-Bench private Member&#8217;s Bill makes it on to the statute book. Does the Leader of the House know whether the Liberal Democrat part of the Government supports that plan and could it proceed without the Liberal Democrats?</p>
	<p pid="b.893.3/3">The Transparency of Lobbying, Non-party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill returned to the other place this week after the Leader of the House&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="b.893.3/4">six-week panic pause, but despite an on-the-record promise that the Government would use the pause to complete wide consultation and try to address the concerns of charities and campaigners, the Bill remains unamended and there is little evidence that the Government have listened to anyone at all. Will the Leader of the House tell us what he has been up to for the last six weeks, and why he is continuing to ignore the broad coalition of charities and campaigners who are telling him that this bad Bill will have a chilling effect on our democratic debate? May I suggest that the right hon. Gentleman spend his Christmas break pausing, listening, reflecting and improving his approach to legislation?</p>
	<p pid="b.893.3/5">Talking of legislation in a rush, the first thing we discuss on our return in the new year will be the Water Bill. Will the Leader of the House clarify what has happened to the Government&#8217;s proposed plans to crack down on rising water bills, and will he explain why nothing has been included in the legislation? Does he agree with the Opposition view that we should create a national affordability scheme, ensuring access to a social tariff for all? Given that, so far, only three of the 20 water companies have created a social tariff for those who struggle to pay, does he agree that a weakly worded letter to water companies from the Secretary of State is simply not good enough when people are struggling with a cost of living crisis this Christmas?</p>
	<p pid="b.893.3/6">At this time of year, there is nothing better than being sat in front of the fire with a good read. This year, my recommended stocking filler is the Conservative party&#8217;s 2014 &#8220;campaign toolkit&#8221;. Rather than 50 shades of grey, there are apparently only three shades of grey approved for use in Tory literature. Strangely, there are only three approved photos of the Prime Minister, too. I assume that that is to prevent anyone accidentally using a photo of his second cousin nine generations removed&#8212;Catherine the Great, to whom he bears such an eerie resemblance! Catherine the Great was an enlightened despot who became less enlightened and more despotic the older she got, so perhaps the family traits do not just end with appearance.</p>
	<p pid="b.893.3/7">On page 12, under the revealing title &#8220;Out of date visual identity&#8221;, we learn that blue sky has been banished because sunshine no longer rules the day. It was not just sunshine that the Tories confined to history in 2013&#8212;it was the Prime Minister&#8217;s hollow claim to be a moderniser. He used to tell us that we were &#8220;all in it together&#8221;, but this year we got a tax cut for millionaires while real wages fell by more than &#163;360. He used to tell us that he would fight for a new politics, but all we have had is Lynton Crosby and his politics of fear and smear. The Prime Minister used to tell us he was a compassionate Conservative, but he gave us the bedroom tax, the closure of hundreds of Sure Start centres and yesterday his MPs laughed and jeered as we debated the record numbers of people forced to turn to food banks to feed themselves and their families in Tory Britain. Does the Leader of the House agree with me that no matter how many PR makeovers they indulge in, the Tories will never change?</p>
	<p pid="b.893.3/8">Given that this is our last sitting day before the Christmas recess, I want to take the opportunity to wish all right hon. and hon. Members and their families, all of the House staff and their families, yourself and your family, Mr Speaker, a very merry Christmas and a happy new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.893.3/9">I have been considering what it would be like if the Cabinet had Christmas dinner together. First of all, everyone would be late because they had spent their journey arguing about the route and U-turning so often that they were driving round in circles. The turkey would be half-cooked, like their policies, and the Leader of the House would have to call for a pause halfway through the meal. The Prime Minister&#8217;s lapdog, the Deputy Prime Minister, would be encouraged to learn that election promises are for life, not just for Christmas. Perhaps the joke in the Christmas crackers would simply read, &#8220;Vote Lib Dem&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="b.895.0/1">I am grateful to the shadow Leader of the House for her response to the business statement and, in particular, for her Christmas good wishes to Members and House staff. She only slightly raided the Christmas crackers in advance with her comments today.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.0/2">The hon. Lady asked about the private Member&#8217;s Bill relating to the EU referendum, which is in the House of Lords. The issue would arise only if the Lords were not to pass it, and my hope is that their Lordships will recognise the support that the Bill attracted from this House. From memory, I think that there was a majority of some 200 in favour of Third Reading in the House of Commons. I think that that should serve as an indication to the House of Lords of the positive sentiment that was attached to the proposal for an EU referendum when it left this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.0/3">The hon. Lady asked about the transparency Bill. Clearly she has not taken on board how often the House of Lords considers legislation. Their Lordships frequently deal with the Committee stages of Bills, but in this case neither the Government nor others who had tabled amendments pressed those amendments to a vote, because they wanted to discuss some issues on Report in the context of Government amendments. My right hon. and noble Friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness made it clear to the House of Lords that a wide-ranging consultation had indeed taken place, and emphasised the benefit that will, I know, be apparent when the Lords consider the Bill on Report.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.0/4">The hon. Lady also asked about the Water Bill, which, as she said, we will debate when we return in the new year. I look forward to that debate, because I think it will show that we can increase benefits to consumers in two main ways: by giving them access to more competition in the water industry, and by giving those who are at risk of flooding access to a continuing and secure scheme for the delivery of flood insurance. As for the question of tariffs, the hon. Lady should bear in mind the work that the regulator is doing with the water companies to try to ensure that, in the next period of regulation, they deliver the best possible benefits and value for money to consumers. I know that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change supports that work.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.0/5">I am sad to have to tell the hon. Lady that I am not responsible at this Dispatch Box for what the Conservative party has put in its 2014 &#8220;campaign toolkit&#8221;. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I may not be sad, but if the hon. Lady is really going to read that on Christmas Day, I fear that she is rather sad. I confess that I shall not be reading it. I should add that</p>
	<p pid="b.895.0/6">when the hon. Lady reached the point of comparing the Prime Minister to Catherine the Great, I felt that it was a case of &#8220;more desperate than despot&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.895.0/7">In this season of good will, I think that I should conclude with good news. Growth in the economy is 1.5% higher than it was a year ago, and retail sales are up. We are net exporters of cars, and the automotive industry produced more cars in the first 11 months of this year than it did in the previous 12. Manufacturing and services are up. Moreover, 2.7 million people have been taken out of income tax altogether, and every basic rate taxpayer can look forward to a benefit of at least &#163;700 after next April. Fuel duty has been frozen, unemployment is down, and employment in the private sector is up by more than 1.6 million. There are fewer workless households than at any time since records began. That, I think, is a source of good cheer for Christmas present and hope for Christmas future&#8212;and I am afraid that, for the Opposition, it means no return to their Christmas past.</p>

	<p pid="b.896.1/1">Let me add another item to my hon. Friend&#8217;s list. Access to NHS services for those who do not have internet access is also very important.

	<p pid="b.896.1/2">We will do all that we can to protect vulnerable people by helping those who are offline to gain access to online services. We will increase access to the internet, improve digital skills, and ensure that people are aware of the benefits that going online can bring. A new cross-Government digital inclusion team has been established in the Cabinet Office as part of the Government Digital Service with the aim of driving forward the digital inclusion agenda, and we plan to publish a digital inclusion strategy early in the spring.

	<p pid="b.898.1/1">I have spoken to the Leader of the House on several occasions about my concerns over the environmental statement on HS2 that has been issued by the Department for Transport. The fact that it is tens of thousands of pages long is putting great strain on our environmental organisations, because the Department has given them only eight weeks over the Christmas period in which to respond to it. Furthermore, the memory sticks containing those tens of thousands of pages had to be recalled because of omissions and errors, and new ones had to be issued. Will the Leader of the House allow a debate on the possibility of extending the consultation period immediately?<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140106/corrtext/140106c0001.htm#column_2MC"><i>[Official Report, 6 January 2014, Vol. 573, c. 2MC.]</i></a></p>

I am not in a position to extend the period as she requests, not least because the 56-day consultation period for the environmental statement that precedes the production of a report by the person appointed by the House was determined not by the Department for Transport but by the House, by means of orders made in June relating to changes in the Standing Orders covering hybrid Bills.</p>

One of the beneficiaries would have been Papworth Trust, which is based in my constituency, so I felt precisely the sense of distress that many families felt about this. It is difficult; hard cases make bad law. The last thing we could contemplate is having some kind of regulatory process before people are able to set up such an event. However, trading standards can certainly look at the consequences and the lessons to be learned from something of the kind he describes.</p>

Their income limit has not increased and one of the carers in my constituency, Mrs James, has her income assessed on a weekly basis, because she works on a zero-hours contract. If, in one week out of four, she earns &#163;1 over the &#163;100 allowance, she loses her carer&#8217;s allowance for the entire month, even though her income for the rest of the month might be &#163;25 one week and &#163;35 the next.

I think that is evident from our allocation of some &#163;400 million to ensure that carers have access to more respite breaks; from the Children and Families Bill, which delivers additional support to children who are carers; from our commitment to deliver health checks and support to carers; and from all the additional carer rights in the Care Bill&#8212;the hon.

	<p pid="b.911.3/1">On Monday of this week, 615 of my constituents lost their jobs at Sharp&#8217;s solar plant in Wrexham when investment, which was hard won in 2004 under the previous Government, ended. May we have a debate on this Government&#8217;s chaotic investment policy on renewables, which is deterring international investors from bringing jobs to the UK for constituents such as mine, who will have no jobs this Christmas?</p>

I will of course look at the situation the hon. Gentleman raises, which must be of concern to his constituents in Wrexham in particular, and ask my hon. Friends at the Department for their response.

	<p pid="b.913.2/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on a report being published today by the former Court of Appeal judge, the right hon. Sir Peter Gibson, into the treatment of detainees. It may first be helpful to remind the House of the circumstances in which Sir Peter&#8217;s inquiry was set up.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/2">In the statement he gave to the House in July 2010, the Prime Minister explained that questions had been raised about the degree to which, in the years immediately after the horrific events of <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, British officers had worked with those from foreign security services who were treating detainees in ways they should not have done. The Prime Minister made clear that it has never been suggested that United Kingdom intelligence officers were themselves directly responsible for the mistreatment of detainees. Nevertheless, the allegations of involvement had done harm to our reputation as a country which believes in human rights, justice and the rule of law and had put into question the robustness of the rules under which our services operate.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/3">The Prime Minister then set out his determination and the determination of the whole coalition Government to get to grips with these allegations so that the security services could get on and do their vital job of keeping us safe. First, he announced that we would seek to settle the civil compensation cases brought against the Government by the former Guantanamo detainees. In due course, a significant settlement was agreed with them in November of that year. Secondly, he introduced vital reforms to improve the operational, parliamentary and judicial regulation of the agencies. Thirdly, he invited Sir Peter Gibson to hold an inquiry that would deal properly with the historical allegations. Sir Peter was asked to begin immediately with his preparatory work, and his inquiry was due to start formally when the police investigations into these matters had concluded. The Prime Minister made it clear that he expected the inquiry to take no longer than a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/4">Sir Peter and his panel and the Government have been frustrated in their hopes of progress by how long the police investigations have taken. It was not until January 2012 that the Crown Prosecution Service and the Metropolitan police issued a joint statement announcing that there was insufficient evidence to bring prosecutions in the two criminal investigations that had been preventing the start of the inquiry&#8217;s public work, but at the same time they also announced that new investigations would begin into alleged renditions to Libya in 2004. Of course, it is important that these matters be investigated</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/5">properly by the police, but it raised the prospect of a still further indeterminate delay before Sir Peter could begin to call witnesses and hear evidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/6">With the panel&#8217;s agreement, therefore, I announced in a statement to the House that the detainee inquiry would produce its report based solely on its preparatory analysis. This report was to highlight any particular themes or issues that should be the subject of further examination. A classified version of the report was to be presented to the Prime Minister, and an open version was to be made public. Nevertheless, the report is a substantial piece of work and the product of extensive independent analysis of some 20,000 written documents, some of which have not been examined by any previous review. It finds no evidence in the documents to support any allegation that UK intelligence officers were directly responsible for the mistreatment of detainees held by other countries overseas, and no material has been referred to the police for further consideration, but it identifies 27 issues that require further examination, grouped under four broad themes: interrogation and treatment; rendition; guidance and training; and matters relating to policy and communications.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/7">The period concerned was one in which we and our international partners were suddenly adapting to a completely new scale and type of threat from fundamentalist religious extremists, and many UK intelligence officers had to operate in extraordinarily challenging environments, subject to real personal danger. Everyone in the Government and the agencies accepts, however, that this bravery has to be combined with clear rules of proportionality and accountability to ensure that we uphold the values we are working hard to defend. So, while we accept that intelligence operations must be conducted in the strictest secrecy, we also expect there to be strict oversight of those operations to ensure that at all times they respect the human rights that are a cornerstone of this country&#8217;s values.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/8">The questions raised by Sir Peter&#8217;s report, combined with the other reviews that have been conducted into the period, paint a picture of Government and agencies struggling to come to terms with the new level of threat faced by this country. It is now clear that our agencies and their staff were, in some respects, not prepared for the extreme demands suddenly placed on them. The guidance regulating how intelligence officers should act was inadequate. The practices of some of our international partners should have been understood much sooner. Oversight was not robust enough, and there was no mechanism in the civil courts for allegations against the security and intelligence services to be examined properly. Most of those problems related to a relatively short period of time in the early 2000s, but they risked some damage to our reputation as a nation that prides itself on being a beacon of justice, human rights and the rule of law. I believe I speak for the whole House when I say that if failures and mistakes were made in that period, it is a matter of sincere regret.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/9">From its very first days in office, this Government have been determined to enact reforms that ensure that the problems of the past cannot be repeated. Those reforms, and changes made under the previous Government, mean that the framework within which our agencies now operate is very different from that during the period which Sir Peter&#8217;s report describes. We have finalised and published consolidated guidance, setting out very</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/10">clearly how intelligence that could lead to a detention should be handled, and how detainee interviews overseas should be conducted. Compliance with this guidance is monitored by the independent Intelligence Services Commissioner who reports annually to the Prime Minister. We have made it clear that Ministers must be consulted whenever an intelligence officer involved in a planned operation believes a detainee is at serious risk of mistreatment by a foreign state, even if that raises the risk of a terrorist action going ahead. We have dramatically improved Parliament&#8217;s ability to oversee the actions of the agencies&#8212;we did that through the Justice and Security Bill, which I took through the House on behalf of the Government last year. The Intelligence and Security Committee is now a Committee of Parliament, fully independent of Government, and the Prime Minister can no longer appoint its Chairman. It can require information of the intelligence agencies, not just request it. It has a new statutory right to review past intelligence operations and, for the first time, the Committee and its staff will have direct access to agency papers.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/11">Finally, the Justice and Security Bill, which is now an Act of Parliament, introduced new court procedures to ensure that if allegations are made that things have gone wrong, even the most secret intelligence activities can be examined by an independent judge in a civil court of law. The combination of these reforms means that a line has begun to be drawn under a difficult period of the past. Despite that, it remains important that we deal properly with the 27 issues that Sir Peter&#8217;s report raises. It would be wrong to leave those issues, many of which relate to matters of policy, unexamined for the unknown amount of time it will take for the police to complete their related investigations. Equally, it would be wrong to ask a judge to examine material which in any way could compromise a live criminal investigation. It is the combination of those police investigations and the fact that they thwart a judge&#8217;s inquiry that have led to the frustrating delay in this case, which is felt by everyone involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/12">Therefore, the Prime Minister has discussed and agreed with the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament that it will inquire into the themes and issues that Sir Peter has raised, take further evidence, and report to the Government and to Parliament on the outcome of its inquiry. Additional resources will be provided to the Committee to undertake that work, so that it does not affect the work it is currently doing on the killing of drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich earlier this year, and its work on the following inquiry it has announced it will be undertaking on the necessary balance between privacy and security as regards communication interception.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/13">To assist the Committee with its work, the Prime Minister has already asked the agency heads to provide him with full and detailed responses to the questions raised in the panel&#8217;s report for which they are responsible. He has also asked the Intelligence Services Commissioner to provide his views on current compliance with those aspects of the consolidated guidance that he monitors. Both of those reports will be made available to the Committee in full by the end of February next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/14">I hope and expect that by the end of next year the ISC will have finished its report. I also hope that the police will have finished their investigations. It will then</p>
	<p pid="b.913.2/15">be possible for the Government to take a final view as to whether a further judicial inquiry still remains necessary to add any further information of value to future policy making and the national interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.916.0/1">I thank the Minister for his statement and Sir Peter Gibson for his work and the interim report.</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/2">As I respond to the right hon. and learned Gentleman&#8217;s statement, I should make it clear that I have not had sight of the redacted version of Sir Peter Gibson&#8217;s interim report, which is published today.</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/3">I am confident that I speak for the whole House when I say that MPs from all parties condemn all forms of inhumane, cruel and degrading forms of treatment. Our freedoms and the high standards we promote in protecting human rights distinguish us as a nation and our influence across the globe is strengthened as a result. Those freedoms are fundamental to our society and our security and intelligence services work on an ongoing daily basis to protect us and the freedoms we hold dear.</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/4">We owe those services a debt of gratitude for keeping this country safe from threats&#8212;work that is dependent on men and women taking grave personal risks on a daily basis. Again, I know I speak on behalf of Members from all parties and the public in thanking them for their crucial role. Notwithstanding the crucial work that the agencies do to keep us safe, any allegations of involvement by members of our security and intelligence services in serious breaches of the law need proper and full investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/5">Any acts that might contravene the law in the ways alleged would run counter to everything our nation stands for and believes in. For that reason, it is important there is a full and proper investigation, exposing any wrongdoing and bringing those responsible to account. We also need to ensure that the appropriate lessons are learned and that there is no repeat in the future. We need to do that in as independent, open and transparent a manner as possible, in a way that maintains the confidence of the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/6">It is now almost two years since the Minister stood at the Dispatch Box and announced that his Government&#8217;s inquiry, led by Sir Peter Gibson, was to be abandoned because of ongoing criminal investigations. I have some questions for the Minister that I hope he will be able to answer this afternoon. Why has there been such a long delay in the publication of Sir Peter Gibson&#8217;s report? Of course, we understand why sensitive parts of the report need to be redacted, but who decided which sections were redacted?</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/7">The Minister was categorical in January 2012 that a future judge-led inquiry would be restarted at an appropriate time in the future. That is particularly important in light of the commitments made by the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Deputy Prime Minister that it had to be an independent judge-led inquiry. Bearing in mind that the interim inquiry by Sir Peter Gibson has identified 27 issues that require further examination, why have the Government changed their mind about the importance of the restarted inquiry also being judge-led?</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/8">There are recent examples of a judge successfully examining material in an inquiry without compromising criminal investigations. Will the Minister therefore explain</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/9">why he has handed the inquiry into the issues that Sir Peter has raised over to the ISC rather than a judge? I have great respect for the Committee&#8217;s work and recognise that it has increased powers and increased resources, but does the right hon. and learned Gentleman believe that his original aspirations&#8212;and those of the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary&#8212;for the inquiry to be as independent, open and public as possible can be met by such an investigation?</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/10">Bearing in mind that much of the litigation in this area will inevitably be conducted under closed material proceedings, the scope and coverage of which the Government extended last year to include such cases, does the Minister agree that there is even more reason to ensure that any investigation is as independent and transparent as possible, and has the confidence of the public? Does the Minister believe that the public will have greater confidence in an ISC investigation than in a judge-led one? If so, will he explain his thinking?</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/11">Organisations representing detainees and their families had concerns that Sir Peter Gibson&#8217;s original inquiry was not compliant with articles 3 and 6 of the European convention on human rights. They chose to disengage from the process. I asked the Minister back in January 2012 what he intended to do to ensure that the inquiry&#8217;s legitimacy was bolstered by working to re-engage those groups and organisations. The interim findings, published by Sir Peter Gibson today, could have been used as an opportunity to show the non-governmental organisations and the public that the judge-led inquiry was working under its terms of reference to win back the confidence of the public. Does the Minister think that that is an opportunity missed?</p>
	<p pid="b.916.0/12">My final question for the Minister is what additional steps he and the ISC will take to address the perception&#8212;fair or unfair&#8212;that today&#8217;s announcement of the ISC taking over the inquiry is a whitewash? Ultimately, the key aims are to get to the bottom of what happened and to ensure that lessons are learnt and justice is done, as well as maintaining public confidence. We will work constructively in any way we can to satisfy those aims.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.917.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" speakername="Kenneth Clarke" colnum="917"  time="011:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#131219-0002.htm_spnew18">
	<p pid="b.917.0/1">First, I certainly share the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s frustration with the delay, which was not contemplated by the Prime Minister or anyone in government when we embarked on this process. Indeed, we are extremely anxious to inquire as necessary as quickly as possible so that we can draw a line under this matter, learn lessons and ensure that the House can be totally confident that there would be no similar problems in future. The delay has been caused by the length of time taken for the police to investigate these matters. No politician has control over the police and it is right for them to inquire into issues where they believe it is justifiable to do so, but the result has been a timeless delay. Nobody has been able to proceed, in Sir Peter Gibson&#8217;s case, to the calling of witnesses and the taking of evidence, because that could compromise any criminal procedures and investigations that needed to take place in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.917.0/2">I join the right hon. Gentleman in praising the work of Sir Peter and his panel in producing this report, which, in the circumstances, is extremely valuable, but as the panel makes clear, it can come to no conclusions and make no findings of fact or conclusive allegations</p>
	<p pid="b.917.0/3">against anybody, and nor can it clear anybody conclusively, because it relied on documents that were frustrated when it came to calling witnesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.917.0/4">Only one passage in the report is redacted. We did our best to reach agreement with the panel on the redactions and we were anxious to publish as much as possible, as was the panel. The redactions relate to a matter that is already subject to a public interest immunity certificate in the courts. In my and the Government&#8217;s opinion, there was no going back on that. Sir Peter and the panel acknowledge in the text that the redaction is of no significance to the general narrative and the issues set out in the report.</p>
	<p pid="b.917.0/5">The Prime Minister was quite clear about preferring a judge-led inquiry. When he said that almost two years ago, I said we would set up the judicial inquiry once the police investigations were over and we could get the inquiry under way. That has not proved possible, however. Nobody contemplated at that time that in December 2013 we would still be trying to work out when we would be capable of proceeding.</p>
	<p pid="b.917.0/6">A judge-led inquiry normally involves the publication of evidence as the inquiry proceeds, although in cases such as this the evidence is sometimes redacted. The whole process of a judicial inquiry could conceivably compromise a criminal investigation. It is true that some recent inquiries, such as that conducted by Lord Justice Leveson into a totally different matter, proceeded although criminal investigations were taking place, but Lord Justice Leveson avoided, very scrupulously, any areas that might compromise the criminal investigation. The trouble with Sir Peter Gibson&#8217;s scope is that the only matters that he is considering are the subject of criminal investigations, so the same situation could not arise. The Prime Minister has therefore come up with the solution of referring the issue to the Intelligence and Security Committee in the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="b.917.0/7">I hope that the right hon. Gentleman can be persuaded that that is a very good way of proceeding. The ISC&#8217;s inquiry can start now, whereas a judge-led inquiry could not. Moreover, the House of Commons has greatly strengthened the ISC. When we debated these matters last year, Members in all parts of the House agreed that we should make the ISC independent, more powerful, and capable of calling for, rather than merely requesting, the information that it wanted. I think that we now have an opportunity to demonstrate that its work is a valuable addition to all the other requirements in our constitution to ensure that the activities of our intelligence services are properly accountable, and that, as far as is feasible, there is some democratic oversight of what can be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.917.0/8">Finally, the right hon. Gentleman reminded me that, two or three years ago, non-governmental organisations and perfectly reasonable lobbies had criticised Sir Peter Gibson and refused to co-operate with him because, in their view, his inquiry did not comply with article 3 of the European convention on human rights. I remember that exchange, which disappointed me at the time. The organisations concerned appeared to be arguing for a full-blooded public inquiry in which everyone would be represented&#8212;detainees present, press sitting in the gallery at the back&#8212;and in which a great deal of evidence would be produced that would be of enormous value to this country&#8217;s enemies. No country in the world would sensibly deal with matters in that way. I think that the process we are adopting, with the use of the ISC, is the</p>
	<p pid="b.917.0/9">best way of ensuring that our intelligence services remain as strong and effective as we all want them to be, that their bravery is respected, and that they are protected when they carry out work on behalf of all of us, while also ensuring that there is proper scrutiny and a proper inquiry so that we can be reassured that the highest ethical guidelines are being followed.</p>

	<p pid="b.919.0/1">May I, through the Minister, give the House an assurance about the work that the Intelligence and Security Committee has agreed to undertake?</p>
	<p pid="b.919.0/2">As Members will know, in 2005 and 2007 the Committee published reports on the treatment of detainees and on rendition. Those reports turned out to be unsatisfactory and incomplete, because the intelligence agencies had not provided the Committee with all the relevant information, which, at the time, they were under no statutory obligation to do. As the Minister has said, that has now changed: the agencies are required to provide all the information, and the Committee&#8217;s own staff can go directly to them and inspect their files. It is on that basis, and on the basis of the extra resources that we will be given to prevent our other work from being interfered with or delayed, that the Committee believes that it can fulfil this duty, and is very willing to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.919.1/1">I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for explaining why we gave the ISC more powers, and why that very powerful Committee, with its very strong membership, is capable of exercising its responsibilities and&#8212;we hope&#8212;producing the information that we require. The Gibson report did indeed indicate that when it had previously tried to conduct inquiries into detention and rendition, the Committee had not been given access to much fuller information involving all the incidents of detainee mistreatment that had been complained about, and the full internal investigations of rendition that had taken place.

	<p pid="b.919.2/1">Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for allowing me a response at greater length than is usual. May I thank the right hon. and learned Gentleman for his statement and the care he has taken in handling this matter, which I personally appreciate, and may I say that I share many of the sentiments he has expressed?</p>
	<p pid="b.919.2/2">I greatly welcome today&#8217;s announcement that the Intelligence and Security Committee will now inquire into the questions raised by Sir Peter Gibson&#8217;s interim report, and that all relevant witnesses will be able to give testimony in person? Such a further inquiry is, surely, imperative given that the 27 sets of issues Sir Peter identifies have been based entirely on the available documents, and not on any statements, or oral examinations of witnesses?</p>
	<p pid="b.919.2/3">May I tell the House that, as Foreign Secretary, I acted at all times in a manner that was fully consistent with my legal duties and with national and international law, and that I was never in any way complicit in the unlawful rendition or detention of individuals by the United States or any other state?</p>
	<p pid="b.919.2/4">Is the right hon. and learned Gentleman aware, as Sir Peter brings out in his interim report and has long been known more widely, that in early January 2002 I agreed that the UK should not stand in the way of UK nationals who were detained in Afghanistan by the United States being transferred to Guantanamo Bay, and that I did so after careful legal advice and because, at the time, it was the only practical alternative to their remaining in custody in Afghanistan? But will the right hon. and learned Gentleman also accept that we never agreed in any way to the mistreatment of those detainees or to the denial of their rights, that we made repeated objections to the United States Government about these matters, and that I was able to secure the release of all British detainees by January 2005?</p>
	<p pid="b.919.2/5">Does the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that we should never forget the context: that the period covered by this report was the aftermath of the world&#8217;s most appalling terrorist atrocity ever, on <phrase class="date" code="2001-09-11">11 September 2001</phrase>, and that in this period there was a continuing and profound anxiety of further terrorist outrages to come&#8212;anxieties that were all too well placed, as we all discovered on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-07">7 July 2005</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="b.919.2/6">Finally, will the right hon. and learned Gentleman agree that throughout this difficult period it was the exemplary professionalism and bravery of our armed forces and of the staff of our intelligence and security agencies which ensured that, in so far as was humanly possible, our nation and its people were kept safe?</p>

	<p pid="b.920.0/1">I have the greatest respect for the right hon. Gentleman and I have considerable sympathy with him for the frustrating personal position in which he finds himself. There has been briefing around this matter and allegations have been made, and he has had no opportunity of appearing before Sir Peter and giving evidence, which he was anxious to do, and helping Sir Peter and the panel establish what actually happened during the period in question. He will now have the opportunity to do so when the ISC looks into these matters. Obviously, I cannot give any opinion on the issues the right hon. Gentleman raises because they relate precisely to what we are trying to get someone to investigate and reach a conclusion on, but it is certainly the case, as Sir Peter&#8217;s report makes clear, that one of the issues that will have to be looked at is whether Ministers were properly informed in full about what was going on and what necessary ministerial authorisation there was.</p>
	<p pid="b.920.0/2">I also share the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s final sentiment. I hope that all Members agree that we want the toughest and most effective intelligence services we can get and that we want our intelligence services to be at least as effective as those of any other nation. But we are a democracy and we also want to know that what they do is proportionate, complies with essential ethical standards and is authorised by a Minister, and that all the activities are carried out by people who are accountable to the Ministers responsible and to Parliament as well, when possible. That is the conclusion I hope we will eventually reach.</p>

	<p pid="b.920.1/1">The security services do a great job and they deserve our support, but I do not think this statement will help them. It is</p>
	<p pid="b.920.1/2">truly shocking that Britain has facilitated kidnap and torture, and the decision to abandon this judge-led inquiry will, I think, come to be seen as a mistake. Does the Minister agree that it is as essential for the standing of the intelligence services, on whom we depend, as it is for the wider public that we get to the truth about the extent of Britain&#8217;s involvement, as only that way can we restore trust? The Minister has said that the ISC will complete this work, but what confidence can the public have in its conclusions when that same body wrongly concluded that Britain was not involved in 2007, only to be flatly contradicted by a High Court ruling the following year? Is it not the case that the ISC&#8217;s new powers about which we have just heard are in any case heavily qualified&#8212;papers may be withheld on grounds of sensitivity and the ISC&#8217;s remit on operational matters is only permitted in certain circumstances?</p>

	<p pid="b.921.0/1">First, I share my hon. Friend&#8217;s determination that we get to the truth of these matters and that they are investigated. Indeed, I share his concern that anybody from the United Kingdom should be involved in unlawful rendition, and I used to support his campaigns when we were both in opposition. I disagree with him about the way we are progressing now. The judge-led inquiry cannot proceed with taking evidence from people and publishing evidence alongside continuing police investigations which may or may not lead to some further criminal proceedings if anyone is eventually prosecuted. The question is do we, frustratingly, just continue to wait&#8212;I think it is more than three years since the Prime Minister made his statement&#8212;or do we seek to demonstrate that we really have now got a parliamentary Committee with the powers and authority required to do the job and report back to this House and the Prime Minister on its findings and recommendations?</p>
	<p pid="b.921.0/2">I am sorry that my hon. Friend is dismissive of the Committee&#8217;s powers. He took part in the debates last year. We have considered them and the Committee has far more powers than it previously had. One of the things it will be looking at is how, when the previous Committee investigated treatment of detainees and rendition, it did not appear to have been supplied with information that was in fact being shared with others inside the Government and which had been assembled by the agencies for their own use. I think it is highly unlikely that that will be repeated and I think the present Committee can be relied upon to use the powers to demand papers and to go to the offices and look through the records of the agencies in order to revisit its conclusions on those matters.</p>

	<p pid="b.921.1/1">May I ask the Minister to confirm my understanding of what he has said, which is that Sir Peter and his team have identified a large number of questions, many of them fairly familiar, to which they have been unable to find answers in the documents they have studied, and that in consequence they have not drawn conclusions? I ask him to reaffirm that that is the case, because my strong suspicion is that there will be those who will try to draw conclusions nevertheless.</p>

	<p pid="b.921.2/1">Given that somebody has been briefing in advance, which I give the assurance is certainly not me or anybody with my authority, it is already clear that</p>
	<p pid="b.921.2/2">people are drawing the conclusions that we would anticipate them drawing if they already happened to be on one side of the argument or another before we started, and that, I am afraid, will continue. The right hon. Lady makes an extremely important point, and Sir Peter makes it clear at least twice in the report he is publishing today that it is quite wrong, and indeed impossible, to make findings of fact, and certainly any findings concerning any individuals involved, before he has called evidence, called them before him if necessary, given them an opportunity to explain and completed these investigations. That is why this inquiry identifies issues, which the ISC will now consider and decide whether and how to pursue. It has not made any findings of fact. In this country it would be quite wrong to make findings of fact of any kind, or to draw adverse inferences against anybody, when nobody has given any evidence, nobody has been challenged, and nobody has been given a chance to give their own explanation of events.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase> that the agencies do not have the power to withhold sensitive material from the ISC, of which I am a member? If they wish to do so, they have to appeal directly to the Prime Minister. In every other respect, they have to give us what we want to see. May I also remind the House that the ISC has been keen to get to grips with this matter, and that it actually started its own investigation, which had to be stayed when the Gibson inquiry was set up? Finally, may I give the House a personal assurance that, notwithstanding the context of trying to bring Libya back within the comity of nations, there are members of the ISC&#8212;one third of whom are senior Labour Members&#8212;who, far from endorsing any whitewash, would take a great deal of convincing that it was ever reasonable, proportionate or justifiable to supply people to Colonel Gaddafi&#8217;s regime?</p>

	<p pid="b.922.2/1">Is not the heart of the issue the lack of effective accountability of the security services, and the fact that the ISC is not an ordinary parliamentary Committee? It is appointed by the Prime Minister and reports to him. Are not the Minister&#8217;s proposals just a way of sidestepping the need for a serious examination of the accountability issue and for holding an independent judge-led inquiry rather than the process that has been set out?</p>

	<p pid="b.922.3/1">I have addressed that point already, and I would have hoped that my earlier answer would have satisfied the hon. Gentleman. My starting point is the same as his. We need the intelligence services, and I share the gratitude that many have expressed for the bravery and determination that they demonstrate in protecting the citizens of this country from the undoubted threats to their lives and safety. I want intelligence services that work properly. Indeed, I hope that they will steal the secrets of our serious enemies. I also hope that they will alert us to what those enemies are proposing to do, and help us to frustrate them. It is the experience</p>
	<p pid="b.922.3/2">of quite a number of people in this House that that is exactly what the intelligence services do, and that they do it very effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.922.3/3">It is also important, as the hon. Gentleman says, that what the intelligence services do is proportionate to the scale of the risk posed, that they are accountable and that, when they start going in for subterfuge, it is authorised by a Minister who is democratically accountable to this House. That is what marks out our intelligence services from those of totalitarian regimes, and that must always be the case. Those standards must apply to all the activities involved, including collecting data, surveillance and the activity of the agencies in the field. I am afraid that, in the modern world, such activities will always be necessary to protect the safety of our citizens, so long as we are not damaging our values and so long as we can be confident that everything is accountable and authorised by the proper people.</p>

	<p pid="b.923.0/1">The Foreign Affairs Committee published its human rights report in October. In it, we expressed our concern that no progress had been made in agreeing with human rights groups how a successor to the detainee inquiry might proceed on a more transparent basis. I have heard what the Minister has just said about human rights groups, but given that we owe a lot to their efforts&#8212;there would have been no Belhaj investigation without them, for example&#8212;will he initiate discussions to see whether any common ground can be established?</p>

	<p pid="b.923.1/1">It is also possible that there would have been no Belhaj investigation if someone in Colonel Gaddafi&#8217;s entourage had not carelessly left their papers lying about when fleeing Tripoli. That is no doubt one of the matters that will be inquired into in due course. I have the greatest sympathy with the human rights organisations; they are on the side of the angels, and they expound principles with which I wholeheartedly agree. However, I continue to believe&#8212;as I stated when we were arguing about closed sessions in civil proceedings last year&#8212;that they are being wholly unrealistic if they think that the intelligence services can be effective while the details of all their operations are being discussed in open court. We are not here to feed the media, or to help people who are gathering evidence for whatever civil litigation they might wish to bring. We are here to ensure that we have truly effective, working intelligence agencies that protect the citizens of this country. We make them accountable, but we also need to exercise common sense and have regard to their safety as we go about inquiring into their activities.</p>

	<p pid="b.924.1/1">It seems curious that, if a judge-led inquiry cannot proceed while a police investigation is going on, an ISC inquiry should be able to proceed. Another, more interesting, issue is the question of democratic accountability. My right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40340" name="Malcolm Rifkind">the Member for Kensington (Sir Malcolm Rifkind)</phrase> is a man of deep experience, and we are lucky to have him in the House. If the time should come when he decides to step down, however, we will need procedures of democratic accountability.

	<p pid="b.924.2/1">As I said in my statement, the problem with a judge-led inquiry is that it is normal, having taken evidence from witnesses, for it to produce evidence as the inquiry goes along. The ISC can proceed in whatever way it wishes, however, and it is not likely to do that. So we can start to proceed with the ISC inquiry, whereas to proceed with a judge-led inquiry could be more difficult and would certainly give rise to some controversy. I do not think that one route is necessarily preferable to the other, so long as both are strong, independent and effective in coming to their conclusions. Whether we have done enough to strengthen the ISC will no doubt be easier to decide when it has completed the three important reports that it is working on. It is now looking into the background agency information on the murder of Lee Rigby, as well as examining the whole question of collecting material, surveillance and the balance between security and privacy. And it is now going to look into the considerable matters of detention and rendition, although I presume that it will not undertake all those inquiries contemporaneously. We wish the members of the ISC well in their labours; they have taken on a considerable amount of responsibility. If, at the end, we decide that the Committee needs to be strengthened further, that will be the time to look into that. It will not be a matter for me anyway; it will be for the House to decide on the procedures for appointing the Committee.</p>

	<p pid="b.925.3/1">As there is that reserve power, I cannot give an absolute guarantee that it will be a dead letter when we start. The Prime Minister is as anxious to get these matters resolved&#8212;to draw a line under them&#8212;as everybody in this House is. So it is inconceivable to me that the Prime Minister will be persuaded to start using reserve powers just to cover up embarrassment or to avoid the thing going too far, and I certainly hope that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> is reassured by that; it is not what the reserve power is for. Unfortunately, there are occasions when there are just disagreements about how dangerous it is, or otherwise, for particular information to be disclosed widely at all. The Prime Minister has the invidious task of making the final decision on that if a real conflict arises, but there is no reason to anticipate at this stage that the ISC and the agencies are going to be in any conflict that would give rise to that.</p>

	<p pid="b.925.4/1">Does my right hon. and learned Friend agree that perhaps the answer to the question posed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" name="Rory Stewart">the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase> is that the ISC&#8217;s proceedings will be covered by parliamentary privilege.

	<p pid="b.925.5/1">It is certainly important that the two are kept separate. I seem to recall that when the ISC was given its new status there was quite a bit of discussion</p>
	<p pid="b.925.5/2">about the extent to which privilege would apply to this particular parliamentary Committee, which is of course set up by statute, which is not usual for most of the others. I assume that the ISC can afford the full protection of privilege to the witnesses who are called before it, and that, again, ensures that they cannot suddenly find that this is all being held against them if they find themselves later, by any chance, in the unfortunate position of having to give evidence about the same facts again.</p>

	<p pid="b.926.1/1">I will not try to paraphrase the report, but that is one of the things it raises; there were about 40 occasions when our officers were raising queries about the treatment of detainees they were involved with and sometimes joining in the interrogation of. The question is: how were the queries handled? Not all of them appear to have been referred to Ministers, but these are the issues that are raised. This does underline that the agents involved were perfectly alert, and had the usual sensitivities, to the fact that the foreign officers with whom they were liaising were not necessarily following the same standards that we would wish. The thing I should emphasise, and should have emphasised more as I have gone through, is that this is what the consolidated guidance put out by the Prime Minister underlined when he put it out; it provided absolute clarity, for the first time, about how such concerns should be handled, and gave much better and clearer guidance to the officers themselves about what they should do if they are becoming concerned about the conditions in which detainees are being held.</p>

	<p pid="b.926.2/1">These matters are clearly difficult for the police to investigate. My right hon. and learned Friend, like everybody else, is clearly frustrated at the amount of time this is taking. In his discussions with the Home Office, has he come to the conclusion that this is due to a lack of resources, of leadership or of co-operation with other Governments? What can be done to speed up the police investigation?</p>

	<p pid="b.926.3/1">I wish I could find some way of speeding up the police investigation&#8212;I have wished that several times in the course of the past two or three years. But it is a fundamental principle that police investigations in this country are not subject to political control, and it is just not possible for a Government Minister to start intervening and questioning or second-guessing what the police are doing. I am assured that the police are carrying out thorough investigations and I only have estimates of when they might finish. That is why we have come to the situation, which has dissatisfied some of my colleagues, where we really have to get on and inquire into this, and the best way of proceeding is to put our new ISC to the test.</p>

In essence, the pattern is the same as for a ministerial statement. Mrs Louise Ellman will speak to her subject for up to 10 minutes&#8212;there is no obligation to take all that time &#8212;during which no interventions may be taken. At the conclusion of her statement, I will call Members who rise to put questions to Mrs Ellman on the subject of her statement and call Mrs Ellman to respond to those in turn. Members can expect to be called only once. These interventions should be questions and should be brief. Front Benchers may take part in the questioning, although it would be seemly for them to hold their horses, as I am keen first to hear the contributions of Back-Bench Members.</p>

	<p pid="b.927.2/1"><i>(Select Committee Statement)</i>: I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement about the Transport Committee&#8217;s recent report on high-speed rail. The crowded west coast main line currently combines long-distance inter-city, inter-regional and commuter passenger services, together with freight. Network Rail predicts that by the middle of the next decade the line will be unable to meet demand for new train paths and there will be increasing levels of overcrowding. In 2011, we looked in detail at the Government&#8217;s proposals for a new high-speed rail line from London to Birmingham and onwards to Manchester and Leeds. Phase 1 is due to be completed by 2025, and phase 2 by 2032-33. This proposed new line is a major piece of national rail infrastructure and must be seen as part of the wider rail network. We commissioned our own research into HS2, and considered the capacity the alternatives could provide. We concluded that only HS2 could deliver the step change in capacity needed to accommodate forecast long-term demand on the line.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/2">Our new report looked again at HS2, in the light of the revised strategic case published by the Department for Transport in October and the research by KPMG on the line&#8217;s regional economic impact. The Department&#8217;s case rests on a prediction of 2.2% per annum growth to 2036. Demand is assumed to stop growing after that, only three years after completion of the line. Capacity remains the key issue and no new information has emerged to challenge the conclusion we reached on this question two years ago. Alternatives to HS2, based on upgrading the existing line and changes to train configurations, would not provide a long-term answer to the capacity challenge. These alternatives would themselves be costly and cause considerable disruption over a long period.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/3">In addition to addressing capacity issues, the line will increase connectivity between our major cities. It can help to promote growth in the UK&#8217;s city regions and contribute to a rebalancing of the economy. This, however, is not automatic. Local authorities and local enterprise partnerships must develop economic development strategies to ensure that this takes place, and the Government must back these. The Department must become more proactive in ensuring that HS2, as part of the nation&#8217;s infrastructure, brings maximum benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/4">UK firms and workers must have the opportunity to secure employment from this major investment, starting with its construction. This requires specific initiatives to make businesses across the country aware of the possibilities. Action must be taken to enable all regions to benefit from improved services and a more successful economy. KPMG&#8217;s assessment of the regional economic impacts has generated considerable controversy. This is useful work, but there are limitations to its findings and the research should be developed further.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/5">The report highlights the varying effects HS2 can have on different areas. This research reinforces the importance of taking steps to ensure that the benefits are spread as widely as possible. Work should now be prioritised to widen access to the high-speed network, improving journey times on the classic railway and promoting additional local and regional services on capacity freed up by the new line. This means that the Department, HS2 Ltd and Network Rail must work together.</p>
	<p pid="b.927.2/6">Control of costs is essential. The estimated cost of HS2 over a 20-year period is &#163;28 billion, plus &#163;14 billion contingency and &#163;7.5 billion for rolling stock. These are major amounts of money&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.928.1/1">It is vital that the costs are actively managed.</p>
	<p pid="b.928.1/2">Consideration should be given to speeding up delivery, including looking at options from building north to south, as well as northwards from London. Sir David Higgins, the incoming chairman of HS2 Ltd, should address this. Indeed, Sir David has already told the Committee that he will be looking at these issues, and we will be pursuing this further with him.</p>
	<p pid="b.928.1/3">Concerns have been expressed that funding for the new line will squeeze other transport budgets. This is a serious issue. There is, however, no evidence that this is happening, looking at projected funding allocations, and we would not accept this situation if it arose. Vigilance is required.</p>
	<p pid="b.928.1/4">Any major investment of this nature taking place over many years inevitably involves risks, but the risks of not going ahead with HS2 outweigh the risks of doing so. Without this investment, the west coast main line will become increasingly overloaded. Commuters will suffer from overcrowding and delayed journeys. It would not be possible to provide new services, and the growth of rail freight will be stifled. Governments will be tempted to raise fares to control demand. The opportunity to reshape the economy and boost growth in the north and the midlands will have been lost. As our continuing debates about airport capacity show, once the opportunity to make a bold investment decision for the future has been missed, it may have gone for decades.</p>

	<p pid="b.928.2/1">I congratulate the hon. Lady on taking part in this procedure, which is new and must be a little daunting. Perhaps she will forgive me for thinking that I was listening to another Government Minister presenting a report. I find it surprising, after two years, that the</p>
	<p pid="b.928.2/2">Transport Committee, whose role it is to scrutinise the Department for Transport, has produced a 27-page report&#8212;eight pages of which list contents, so it is probably a 19-page report&#8212;on what is, in effect, the largest infrastructure project in the western world. I hope her Committee will be returning to the subject again and again and asking the right questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.928.2/3">Why did the Committee take oral evidence only from the supporters of HS2 or paid Government consultants, when there were 29 others who responded, including many of those who expressed criticisms of HS2? If the hon. Lady is so concerned about the control of costs, why is she advising the Government on how to spin their lines on cost by suggesting that they refer to a &#163;28 billion sum, rather than the &#163;50 billion that has been budgeted? If she is aware of the risks, as she said in her statement, can she tell me whether she has read all the Major Projects Authority reports on this project, and if so, can she tell us more about what she plans to do to identify those risks that are still being concealed by the Government?</p>
	<p pid="b.928.2/4">Lastly, if Sir David Higgins has been asked to find ways of reducing the cost of HS2, and if the hon. Lady&#8217;s Committee has asked him to consider building phase 1 and phase 2 concurrently, and incorporating the Heathrow link in phase 1, what examination has she made of the effect of that on the bottom line of this project which&#8212;forgive me if I say so&#8212;may be pushing the price tag up even further?</p>

	<p pid="b.929.1/1">The right hon. Lady raises a large number of questions. I will attempt to answer some of them, but I am mindful that other hon. Members wish to make a contribution and ask their questions in the limited time available to us.</p>
	<p pid="b.929.1/2">I am aware that the right hon. Lady has a long-standing opposition to the project and that she is assiduously putting forward the concerns of her constituents. However, this is a national issue and I remind her that this report is a follow-up of a major inquiry conducted two years ago, where independent consultants were appointed to conduct new research into the specific alternatives put forward as possible replacements for the HS2 proposals. The recent inquiry considered 33 pieces of written evidence, in addition to the evidence we heard, and the issues raised in those written pieces of evidence were used as a basis for questions to the witnesses we had in front of us. We also questioned Sir David Higgins before his appointment to HS2 Ltd and we will continue to so.</p>
	<p pid="b.929.1/3">Costs are important, and it is important that those costs are broken down, so that people can see the individual components. Yes, I have read the reports, and ultimately those reports must be analysed against the need to provide continued capacity for the increasing demand on the line from passengers and for freight. This is a continuing process and the Committee will consider what further work it intends to do on this,</p>
	<p pid="b.929.1/4">together with the very detailed work that will take place on the hybrid Bill, should approval be given for that to go forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.930.0/1">It would be idle of me to pretend that I am in favour of this project. In view of the fact that the report pays very little attention to compensation and mitigation measures, will my hon. Friend agree to the Committee looking into the proposition that the measures for compensation and mitigation that apply in my constituency are not even half as good as those measures outside London? For example, it would cost an extra &#163;170 million to put the HS2/HS1 link in a tunnel that goes under Camden Town&#8212;that, apparently, has been ruled out on grounds of cost&#8212;when &#163;2.759 billion is being spent on tunnelling elsewhere, with &#163;812 million being spent in the Chilterns alone?</p>

The Committee concentrated its inquiry on the project&#8217;s strategic impact. However, I accept that the points he raises are extremely serious. Our remit is to consider the strategic impact of the proposed investment. There are other avenues by which the issue he raises can be addressed, but I will report his comments to the Committee for its consideration.</p>

She stated that the Committee&#8217;s support for HS2 is not unqualified, particularly with regard to the Heathrow connection.

	<p pid="b.930.3/1">I appreciate the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s comments. He draws attention to the importance of having an integrated transport policy so that rail, road, aviation and maritime issues can be considered together, and the Committee made remarks of that nature in our initial report two years ago. However, decisions have to be made. The Committee repeats its concern that no decision has yet been taken on the serious question of a direct link to Heathrow. However, we do not have the remit to look at aviation policy at the moment. Indeed, our recommendation is that we think there should be a third runway at Heathrow, but we do not have the authority to take a decision on that. Currently the timetable set out by the Government means that the Davies commission will not report until the summer of 2015. No guarantee has been given on when a decision on airport capacity will be made after that, although I hope that it is soon. Given the timetable for High Speed 2, it seems impractical to say that no decision could be taken on that until well after 2015. However, the point he makes is important and well taken.</p>

	<p pid="b.931.0/1">My hon. Friend draws attention to the great importance of local, and indeed regional, work being conducted to ensure that the potential benefits of High Speed 2 are enjoyed in all parts of the country. Initially, the responsibility for doing that is being taken up in some local areas&#8212;I know that a lot of work is being done in the west midlands and in the Manchester area&#8212;but it is not good enough to leave that entirely to those local and regional authorities. In the Committee&#8217;s future questioning of Ministers and High Speed 2 itself, and specifically Sir David Higgins, I intend to pursue that issue so that, as well as individual authorities taking their own initiatives, there is some kind of national oversight of what is being done. After all, this is one of the biggest national investment decisions to be taken for a very long time. There has to be some responsibility from the Government as well as from localities to ensure that its benefits are felt and that the work to ensure that that happens is carried out.</p>

	<p pid="b.931.1/1">On a day when the newspapers are full of reports of the Chief of the Defence Staff&#8217;s concern that the armed forces are being hollowed out, does the hon. Lady understand why some of us feel that such a costly project betrays a warped sense of priorities? In particular, has her Committee devoted any attention to the fact that even in the short time that the project has been in the public domain the estimated cost has increased from about &#163;30 billion to about &#163;50 billion? What concept does she have of us being able to stick even to that higher figure?</p>

	<p pid="b.931.2/1">The report emphasises that costs must be controlled and that the whole programme must be actively managed to ensure that there is good value for money. In looking at value for money, we must consider the impact that the investment can have and the consequences of not making it. The consequences for the nation would be that our national network would not be able to deliver the results that are required for a prosperous economy that can benefit all parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.931.3/1">I warmly welcome the Committee&#8217;s unanimous conclusion that there is a political, economic and transport case for building southwards, from Leeds and Manchester, at the same time as building northwards from London. I want to ask a specific question about the Committee&#8217;s support for building additional links between the conventional and the high-speed networks. It is already proposed that there should be a spur from the Yorkshire arm of HS2</p>
	<p pid="b.931.3/2">to link with the conventional track at York, with high-speed trains running as far as Church Fenton, which is five miles from York. Would it be possible to upgrade that last five miles so that people in York, which is a major rail hub, could use high-speed services directly&#8212;an example of the sort of improvement in connectivity that the Committee is considering?</p>

He indicates a specific proposal that would improve connectivity to his constituency and the areas around it. I hope that he will put that proposal forward, perhaps developed by the local authority and the local transport authority, during the consultation so that it can be considered as part of the wider benefits of HS2. It is exactly the kind of thing that the Transport Committee advocates should be taken forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.932.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his question. The issue of jobs is extremely important. It is absolutely essential that opportunities are given to UK companies and workers to take advantage of the employment opportunities that will be provided by this major scheme. The Committee has already raised this issue and been told that there will be a road show conducted by HS2 Ltd that will go across the country promoting job opportunities&#8212;similar to the way in which action was taken in relation to Crossrail. Following the road show, it is absolutely essential that Ministers become involved and ensure that the promotion of job opportunities is a major part of the scheme.</p>

Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir John Randall)</phrase> mentioned? The Government seem as intent on delaying that decision as they are on pushing the project forward. At the very least, will my hon. Friend endeavour to ensure that the moribund proposal for an estuary airport is withdrawn? We might not agree on the number of runways we want at Heathrow, but if we had certainty that Heathrow would continue to thrive, we could resolve that issue, which would mean certainty on the route of HS2.</p>

	<p pid="b.932.4/1">My hon. Friend raises an important point. I agree about the importance of securing the Heathrow link. I repeat what I have said previously in relation to the possibilities of an estuary airport: the problems in relation to cost, environmental impacts and the need to close Heathrow airport and London City airport are likely to be insuperable barriers to its being pursued further.</p>

	<p pid="b.933.0/1">The hon. Gentleman raises very important issues. The KPMG report is a very useful piece of research that identifies areas that are due to benefit from High Speed 2 but also areas that would not benefit. When the Committee questioned KPMG about its findings, it became clear that some considerations had not been taken into account, including the latest information on rail improvements being planned for the areas concerned, the possibilities of rents being increased, and the impact of freight developments. Those are just some examples of aspects that had been missed out. Our report says that further reports should be commissioned, and I am sure that the Committee will take a continued interest in that. More research in this very important area should be pursued. It is vital not just that areas that are seen to benefit are made aware of that, but that areas that are worried that they would not benefit are enabled to get maximum support so that they could share in the positive aspects of HS2.</p>

Members should not intervene but rather wait their turn, suggests to me that he was not present at the outset to hear my wise words. Moreover, I have since been advised that he did indeed beetle into the Chamber a couple of minutes into the hon. Lady&#8217;s statement. The concepts of the hon. Gentleman, on the one hand, and brass neck, on the other, are by no means unrelated.

	<p pid="b.933.3/2">My hon. Friend also knows that I started off as a passionate supporter of HS2 until I started reading the international research that suggests that rather than empowering regional cities and making them more affluent and wealthy, such projects have the opposite effect and would drain even more power and influence away from the regions towards London and the south. The Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills came out with a very similar view this morning. Did she take evidence about that research, and did she take evidence from the former Chancellor of the Exchequer? Why did she put so much emphasis on KPMG? Those of us who live in Yorkshire and saw what it did&#8212;or failed to do&#8212;in the banking sector do not trust KPMG further than we can throw it.</p>

	<p pid="b.934.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his question and thank the Speaker for permitting these important issues to be raised. The Committee questioned KPMG because it had conducted the most recent research on this very specific area. However, the Committee&#8217;s reports are based on contributors additional to KPMG.</p>
	<p pid="b.934.0/2">When we conducted our original major inquiry two years ago, we visited France and Germany to see for ourselves the impact of high-speed rail. It became clear that there are major potential benefits to high-speed rail provided that the local and, in the case of France and Germany, regional authorities take advantage of them and provide the necessary economic development support to make them a reality. That is what I would like to happen here in the UK, and that is what the Select Committee report advocates.</p>

Under your stewardship, you have introduced a number of changes to our proceedings. We get through the Order Paper and we have the Speaker&#8217;s lectures; there are all manner of things that I absolutely welcome. However, there are a number of developments in the House that I am not a fan of. I think it was a big mistake to change our Tuesday sittings to the hours that we have now. I very much regret that we have Prime Minister&#8217;s questions only on a Wednesday; I would like to return to 15 minutes on a Tuesday and a Thursday. The Press Gallery is constantly empty, and we need to look at what its purpose is these days. Since we changed our sitting hours, the wonderful staff of the House of Commons, who work so hard, have been affected. The catering facilities have been devastated, and that has had all sorts of repercussions for a number of our staff&#8212;I greatly regret that.</p>

When I first came here, I could press the bell to draw the attention of someone in the Members&#8217; Cloakroom and gain admittance immediately, but now a song and dance seems to be made if Members want to take their constituents to see the Crypt. The point of this place, as I have always understood it, is that there were 646 democratically elected Members of Parliament and everyone worked here to support us in our work, but it is increasingly as if we are the strangers in our own place.</p>
	<p pid="b.936.2/6">I think we should have a dedicated police and security force. I do not understand why that is not the case. It used to be a job for police officers as they approached retirement, but we are increasingly seeing new police officers every day and two or three officers carrying guns around. I do not understand what is going on.</p>

	<p pid="b.936.3/1">As a previous Chair of the Joint Committee on Security, I have to say that the security threats to this place have increased over the years and that the idea of having only eminent but elderly police officers who are approaching retirement does not necessarily fit in with today&#8217;s policing needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.936.4/1">I absolutely agree with my right hon. Friend. I have been here so long that one of the officers who carries a gun came up to me and asked, &#8220;Do you remember taking me around the House of Commons</p>
	<p pid="b.936.4/2">when I was a schoolboy?&#8221;, so I understand that things have changed dramatically in the time I have been here. I am not complaining about that; what I am saying is that there seems to be constant change in personnel. I think it would be better to have an established group who understand how the place works. I certainly do not approve of the constant, huge change.</p>
	<p pid="b.936.4/3">I worry about this place. The damage started in 1997, when huge powers went to quangos. If the place were shut for a few weeks, would anyone notice? That is what I worry about.

	<p pid="b.937.1/1">I am so glad my hon. Friend has reminded me of that. I tell everyone that it has been a long time since my being here has made a huge difference, but I and other colleagues certainly made a difference over Syria. If only I had had the good sense to do that earlier on Iraq, things might be different.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/2">My second moan is about the Chilcot inquiry, on which &#163;7.4 million has been spent. I want the results, just as I did on Leveson. I have asked lots of questions and I am told that the reason for the delay is the huge number of recorded conversations involving the two previous Prime Ministers and President George W. Bush, but I am certainly not going to shut up on this matter. I want the Chilcot report and I want to know exactly what went on behind the scenes.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/3">The Freedom of Information Act has led to all sorts of consequences for all of us. It is crazy that people can make requests without us knowing who they are or their addresses. Why do the media host abusive remarks that are very offensive to constituents and, occasionally, politicians, although, of course, we have extremely broad backs? It is absolutely gutless that we do not know who the people are or their addresses. There is no reason for the media to host such very offensive remarks, which are often about constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/4">On air pollution, there is a hidden killer among us, in the very air we breathe: small particles&#8212;particulates&#8212;created largely by processes of combustion. Once breathed in, they attack the cardiovascular system and cause excess mortality. The proportion of mortality caused by particulates in England is 5.4%, but in my constituency the figure is 5.7%.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/5">Some of the environmental damage arises out of burning coal or biomass, but a lot also comes from the tailpipes of cars. In fact, particulate emissions from diesel have been increasing.</p>
	<p pid="b.937.1/6">Road fuel gases offer impressive reductions in particulate loads. In fact, particulate emissions from cars running on road fuel gases are negligible. Thanks to a concession from a previous Conservative Government, fuel duty is lower on road fuel gases than on petrol and diesel.</p>

	<p pid="b.937.2/1">The hon. Gentleman was making a very good point about emissions from cars, but then he spoiled it by making a</p>
	<p pid="b.937.2/2">party political point about fuel duty, which is neither here nor there. As a fellow east Londoner&#8212;the hon. Gentleman is originally from east London&#8212;I say to him that east London is in desperate need of river crossings. Opponents say that they would encourage traffic and create more emissions, but the emissions in east London are caused mostly by static traffic that cannot move because it is sitting on either side of the Blackwall tunnel. There are more bridges in west London and less pollution. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that pollution can be dealt with by moving traffic, as opposed to static traffic?</p>

	<p pid="b.938.0/1">The hon. Gentleman and I celebrated West Ham beating Tottenham 2-1 last night and I absolutely agree with him. I hope that a number of us will persuade the Government to support a new crossing.</p>
	<p pid="b.938.0/2">The nice thing about cars running on gases is that they offer the motorist a cheaper and cleaner alternative. The autumn statement contained a 10-year pledge to keep stable the advantage of certain road fuel gases over conventional fuels. That is all to the good, but the road fuel gases that are being given that boost are used not in ordinary vehicles, but only in heavier or commercial vehicles. The only fuel to receive a knock in the statement was autogas&#8212;or liquefied petroleum gas&#8212;which is another road fuel gas used by 160,000 British motorists, so they have been put on the trajectory of a gradually reducing benefit from running cleaner cars. It seems an oversight to discriminate in favour of some fuel gases, so I hope the Treasury will look at that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.938.0/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">The hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> is the secretary of the all-party group on fire safety and rescue and I am its chairman. He and I know that it is becoming increasingly apparent that we are not learning many lessons from serious fire incidents. If we look at the causes of major incidents over the past few decades, we will see that there are many common features and similarities. One example is the 2009 Lakanal House tower block fire, in which six people were killed and 20 injured. Many of the causes of that fire, as well as other, more recent fires, were the same as the Summerland fire 40 years ago. The Summerland inquiry recommended that architectural training should include a much-extended study of fire protection and precautions. Yet 40 years later, what on earth has happened? I believe that many lives are being lost unnecessarily because we are not implementing that advice. I hope the Government will do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.938.0/4">I am also worried about the Disclosure and Barring Service, previously known as the Criminal Records Bureau. A number of my constituents have had issues with it and one constituent in particular&#8212;a young man with Asperger&#8217;s&#8212;is finding it very hard to find employment because of it. A DBS certificate is now needed before people can apply for many jobs, including in schools and even cleaning positions, but my constituent is not able to obtain such a certificate, because it has to go through a recognised organisation. Given that the certificate is required before people can start jobs, my constituent is in a very difficult position.</p>

	<p pid="b.939.0/1">I am not sure it has been sorted, but I will write to my hon. Friend on that particular point. It is crazy that individuals are not able to make stand-alone applications but have to go through an organisation. That needs to be changed.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/2">Last month, head teachers in Southend West had a meeting with the Secretary of State for Education. It was a first-class meeting in which the one issue they raised was their concern about school governors. Head teachers require advice and guidance on a vast array of issues in order to ensure that their school is well governed. Although parents may have the will and dedication to be school governors, they do not always have the specialised knowledge. Head teachers in Southend feel very strongly that they need more professionals from the financial sector. They would be an important asset to many school boards and would provide important and necessary advice. Not enough financial professionals are currently volunteering for such posts, so I hope that the Secretary of State will send out a message about getting more of them to be school governors.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/3">Lots of my constituents have issues about the changes in how blue badges for disabled people work. I simply think that the new system is crazy. One constituent who has difficulty with mobility was previously eligible for a blue badge and had one for six years. I thought that as someone aged, they encountered more difficulties, but under the new system it seems that as they age, they suddenly become more able, which is crazy. Since the policy changed in April, my constituent has been told that he is no longer eligible and his appeal has subsequently been rejected. Only this morning, I was told that a young lady with one arm, for whom we managed to get a blue badge for the past three or four years, has suddenly had it stopped. That is absolute madness: something needs to be done and someone needs to take responsibility. On this occasion, I ask the coalition Government to fix the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/4">I am the chair of the all-party group on hepatology, and hepatitis is a public health issue of great concern to me. Public Health England estimates that some 215,000 people are living with hepatitis C in the UK, and it is shocking that many of them remain undiagnosed. Hep C is an infection that causes significant liver damage, potentially resulting in cancer, and it can go undiagnosed for many years due to the lack of symptoms or their generic nature. Despite the high figures, further data from Public Health England suggest that if treatment was increased to just 10% of those with moderate hepatitis C and 20% of those with more advanced hepatitis C, the number of people experiencing liver failure or liver cancer would fall by more than 2,000 in the next 10 years. In my constituency, Southend University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust ranks 31st among hospitals in England for the use of hepatitis B and C treatment, according to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence&#8217;s innovation scorecard, and that could certainly be improved.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/5">I have received constant criticism from my constituents about SEPT&#8212;South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust&#8212;mental health services. All hon. Members know that mental health services are Cinderella services, but when we meet constituents who have a loved one with a mental health problem and we try to get assistance for them, we find that services are often lacking. I hope in the new year to have a dedicated Adjournment debate on that subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/6">For anyone who wants to know, mental health services in my area were headed until last month by Dr Patrick Geoghegan. When I was the MP for Basildon, he was a hospital porter. I am not sure how someone goes from being a hospital porter to being the chief executive&#8212;I think that he was paid &#163;230,000&#8212;but I could go on and on about it. He took retirement last month, but the culture continues: he has been replaced by his long-serving deputy. That situation is simply not good enough. I have complained to Monitor, the Care Quality Commission and the health service ombudsman, but I seem to be getting absolutely nowhere, so I ask the Deputy Leader of the House&#8212;I think that he smiles occasionally&#8212;to have a word with the Minister of State, Department of Health to see whether he can more robust on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/7">At this time of year, we think about animal welfare. I spoke in a debate on live animal exports last year, including about how the long-distance transport of live animals causes them huge distress. The exotic pet trade, in particular, is a huge cause of animal suffering. It is also a conservation issue for some species, a concern to human health and safety, and a possible source of invasion by non-native species, which costs the United Kingdom about &#163;1.7 billion every year in management and control.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/8">In 2002, I co-sponsored a ten-minute rule bill, the Endangered Species (Illegal Trade) Bill, which called for increased penalties under the Endangered Species (Import and Export) Act 1976, including in relation to exotic pet trading. If only that Bill had become law 11 years ago, we would not be in the mess we are in now. It would be good to have a wider debate about the Belgian and Dutch models, in which a positive list limits the type of animals that people are allowed to keep. That is supported by the Federation of Veterinarians in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/9">I will end on a cheerful note. I have a constituent called Ray Woodcock, a great granddad, who recently broke the Guinness world record for the highest bungee jump into water. He jumped 383 feet from a crane into a flooded quarry to raise money for the Southend Taxi Drivers Charity Fund for Children. I think that is absolutely marvellous.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/10">I want to link that to my final point, which is about the city of culture. Hon. Members will be aware that I was somewhat disappointed that Southend was not chosen as the city of culture for 2017, but I am delighted to tell the House that Southend was selected last month as the alternative city of culture. The launch took place at Genting casino, with Patti Boulaye announcing who had won as the alternative city of culture. We also had James Bourne, Jo Wood and an array of celebrities&#8212;Bruce Forsyth and Lee Mead are supporting us&#8212;of which the list goes on and on. I have to tell the House that, as of a month ago, Southend-on-Sea is at cultural war with Hull city: the Thames versus the Humber; Leigh-on-Sea fish versus faggots; Southend United versus Hull City. Between now and 2017, the United Kingdom and the world will realise how rich the culture is in Southend.</p>
	<p pid="b.939.0/11">Madam Deputy Speaker, I wish you and everyone who works here a very happy Christmas and a wonderful new year.</p>

	<p pid="b.940.0/1">I join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">the hon. Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase> in wishing you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and all the House</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/2">staff a happy Christmas and a great 2014. It is always a pleasure to follow the hon. Gentleman, a fellow West Ham supporter, especially on the day after one of our rare wins this season, which has struck a cheerful note. I will not speak on as many subjects as he did. I want to cover only two&#8212;the Deputy Leader of the House is nodding in approval&#8212;which are the individual case of my constituent Mrs Afsana Lachaux, and the firefighters pension dispute, about which I shall speak briefly.</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/3">Afsana Lachaux is a friend of mine, who has been a constituent. She moved to Dubai, but is now stranded there. She is a UK citizen and a Muslim in a Muslim country, but being a woman, she is at a great disadvantage because she is in dispute with her husband over the custody of their child following the breakdown of their relationship.</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/4">For nearly three years, I have tried to help the family to resolve this case. I had very good support from the former Foreign Office Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" name="Alistair Burt">the right hon. Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>, and I have engaged with the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40257" name="Hugh Robertson">the right hon. Member for Faversham and Mid Kent (Hugh Robertson)</phrase>, while our staff in Dubai have also tried to do what they can to help, so I am not making any criticism about that. There has been criticism from the family, who do not think that enough is being done by me, the Foreign Office or our consular staff in the Emirates, but if I was in the family&#8217;s position, I would probably feel exactly the same. Their relative&#8212;their mother, their sister&#8212;has been completely stranded. She has been accused by her estranged husband, who has a record of domestic violence, of all manner of criminal activities. She has been arrested by the Dubai police. She has been jailed. She has been beaten up. She has had the most horrendous experiences at the hands of the Emirati authorities in Dubai.</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/5">Sadly, although Afsana is a Muslim, because she is a woman in a Muslim country and because she is being reported by a man, even though he is French and, I believe, is not a Muslim, she has to explain and defend herself to each set of police officers who come to arrest her and, when she goes to report at police stations and is detained, she has to go through the elaborate process of explaining her circumstances all over again. She is not able to work and is surviving on what her family can send to her from London.</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/6">To compound Afsana&#8217;s misery, she found out last month that her husband had divorced her and had successfully sued for custody of their child in a sharia court in Dubai more than 12 months ago. The rule in the UAE and under sharia law is that if 12 months have lapsed and the decision of the court has not been challenged, it is no longer appealable and is upheld. She was divorced and lost custody, but was not even aware of the fact.</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/7">As Members can imagine, this woman, who has been brutalised, feels totally isolated, completely let down by everybody in authority and persecuted by the authorities in Dubai. She has now found out that she has lost those legal cases. That is a dreadful situation to be in.</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/8">I am taking the opportunity to raise the matter this afternoon to demonstrate to the family that people here care about Afsana and that the Foreign Office and the consular officials are working on the case. The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, has agreed to meet me and I have had meetings with his predecessor</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/9">on the matter. We have tried to meet the French ambassador. I have had a meeting in the past two years with the UAE ambassador. Sadly, given that child custody is involved and given the nature of the case, it is very difficult to penetrate the legal procedures in the Emirates and in Dubai.</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/10">I want to place on the record my appreciation for the efforts that have been made. I hope that we can redouble them to help Afsana escape and to challenge the custody decision of the courts in Dubai. Afsana&#8217;s sister, Rosina Aman, who is my constituent, and her son, Rabbhi Yahiya, will appreciate everything and anything that can be done to help their relative.</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/11">The second issue that I want to raise is the firefighters pension dispute. There is pretty much consensus among those on both Front Benches that the retirement age for firefighters had to be changed. That was certainly the case when I was fire Minister. The terms of the pension scheme were that firefighters had to take compulsory retirement after 30 years&#8217; service or on reaching the age of 55. It was felt that a number of firefighters could work and wanted to work past that. The changes to the rules were supported by the Labour Government and they have been amended recently by the coalition.</p>
	<p pid="b.940.0/12">There has been a big change in the situation that has led to the fire disputes that have raged across our country for months. When we put forward our proposals, my understanding was that firefighters would not be penalised if they had to retire early on the basis of fitness or health and that their pensions would not be unfairly reduced if they could not stay on until 60. That has changed partly because of the cuts, partly because of austerity and partly because of the success of the fire service in reducing the number of calls, fires, deaths and injuries. That is partly the result of better building regulations and procedures being introduced over the past 50 years, notwithstanding the point that the hon. Member for Southend West made about fires, which was entirely valid. Overall, because we mostly live in double-glazed and insulated homes with central heating and because fewer people smoke, there are fewer fires. The fire service&#8217;s education and prevention teams have been extremely successful in reducing the number of fires, and therefore the number of injuries and fatalities. The authorities therefore think that we need fewer firefighters and fire stations.</p>

	<p pid="b.942.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we discard far too early the experience of firefighters who have given most of their lives to saving lives? If firefighters are not fit to do the really physical work, there are key jobs that they can do in fire prevention, fitting smoke alarms and giving general advice to all sorts of public authorities. Their experience should be used for the betterment of society, not thrown away.</p>

	<p pid="b.942.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman because that is exactly the point that I was trying to establish. When we anticipated the extension of the retirement age to 60, we did not think that every operational firefighter would be fit and healthy enough to work until 60. We thought that opportunities would be found for them in back-room jobs in fire prevention, school education and all manner of support roles to ensure that we took advantage of, and did not waste, the</p>
	<p pid="b.942.1/2">experience that they had accumulated over many years on the front line. However, because of austerity and the cuts and reductions that have been made in the service because we do not need as many fire stations and firefighters, there are many fewer such positions for firefighters who are not fit to fulfil other duties.</p>
	<p pid="b.942.1/3">Under the new rules that the Government are trying to push through, firefighters are faced with a massive reduction in their pension if they go before 60. We never anticipated that there would be such a punitive element in the pension arrangements because, as part of the new deal, firefighters are being asked to contribute another 2.6%, which takes their deductions up to 12.6%. Many of us know the fire Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40286" name="Brandon Lewis">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis)</phrase>, and we have a lot of time for a number of the things that he does. Everyone on the Government Front Bench keeps describing the firefighters pension scheme as generous. It is a good scheme, but they are expected to pay 12.6% for it and the reason for that is deaths and injuries. The scheme is valid and valued, as it ought to be, because of the nature of the job.</p>
	<p pid="b.942.1/4">Colleagues regularly stand up in this House to applaud the role that has been played by the emergency services in dealing with some tragedy, disaster, flood or storm. These people risk their lives for us on a daily basis. In their view, they are being forced to take industrial action because nobody is listening. They might have to take a hit of up to a 50% cut in their pension because they cannot last until 60. I am 61 and am relatively fit. I know what that job is about because I did it for 23 years. I know what it is like to be on strike. No emergency service worker wants to go on strike. They risk their lives for 365 days a year and then they have to walk out the door and deny the community that they want to protect the ability, discipline and professionalism that they have built up.</p>
	<p pid="b.942.1/5">This is a monstrous situation. My appeal to the Deputy Leader of the House is that he takes the strong message back to the fire Minister, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and the Prime Minister that we need serious negotiations. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" name="Bob Blackman">the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase> said, if there are places for firefighters to work away from the front line, they will fill those places.</p>

	<p pid="b.943.0/1">I will raise this matter, among others, when I speak. My hon. Friend should be aware that the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union has received a letter from the fire Minister that is dated <phrase class="date" code="2013-12-18">18 December</phrase>, which suggests that he is willing to meet again. The union is responding immediately because it is willing to meet the Minister any time, any place. However, there must be serious negotiations to settle the dispute. There is the potential to avoid strike action if the Minister is serious.</p>

	<p pid="b.943.1/1">I am grateful to my hon.

Nobody</p>
	<p pid="b.943.1/2">here wants to see any more fire strikes. Another series of strikes has been announced but I am convinced that nobody in the fire service wants to see more strikes. The last thing that the general public want to see is the withdrawal of any emergency service, with the cost and disruption that it causes to the authorities who have to provide the best possible cover.</p>

	<p pid="b.944.0/1">To me, this is a bit like groundhog day; this debate seems to have come full circle. The only difference is that I used to be on the Opposition Benches when I took part in it. I am delighted to see that some of the familiar faces from recess Adjournment debates are still around. It is one of the best opportunities we have to raise issues that we cannot always raise over the course of the Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/2">As I said, I possibly come a little bit like the ghost of recess Adjournments past, and Members who are listening keenly may be able to hear the jangling of chains from my previous jailors, which I have not quite thrown off. Keeping to the Dickensian theme, I come here, as always, with &#8220;Great Expectations&#8221;, but I am rather of the Micawber school and think that something will turn up. There was a lot to be said for Mr Micawber, and his view of economics is one we would all share in with regard to annual income and expenditure. Hon. Members across the House ought to remember that.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/3">While on the subject of Mr Micawber, when my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">the Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase> spoke about culture and Southend&#8212;the two words are closely linked&#8212;I was reminded of an excellent production of &#8220;David Copperfield&#8221;. Mr Micawber, and various other roles, were played by a gentleman called Adrian Preater from Hotbuckle Productions, which is touring around the country. If any hon. Members wish to see that production in one of their local theatres, I can probably supply them with upcoming tour dates in the spring, and would be happy to do so. At the moment&#8212;I am reticent to say this, Madam Deputy Speaker&#8212;the company is appearing in a pantomime in Walton-on-Thames and doing MacLaddin. I am afraid that is somewhat Scottish in nature, and possibly takes a rather comical view of that, which I am sure would be disapproved of, although I hope to go and see the production at some stage. I am plugging the company so much because I am hoping for a role in its pantomime next year, and that at least one colleague from across the House will join me as one of the other ugly sisters, or something. We will have to see.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/4">I have a few areas bottled up that I wish to discuss, and I will try not to detain the House for too long. My remarks will be more a trailer of things to come in the coming year; I will not really touch on some of the big feature films such as High Speed 2 and the third runway, because those will probably run and run. While we all</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/5">enjoy Christmas, however, there are many people affected by those major transport infrastructure plans who have yet another year of great uncertainty ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/6">In my borough&#8212;not in my constituency but that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40511" name="Nick Hurd">the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd)</phrase>&#8212;are the wonderful, superb facilities offered by Hillingdon outdoor activities centre. That is very much under threat because a certain railway is planned to go straight through its middle and it will not be able to function. We are all trying to find a site for its relocation because it is a fantastic facility. It is not just for young people; it has lots of facilities for disabled people and serves a wide area. It is almost unique and must be found a new home if HS2 goes ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/7">We are discussing those who will have an uncertain Christmas and future, and I know <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> will almost certainly mention what will happen to many of his constituents who face losing their homes, places of worship and, as we know, the places where the dead are buried. Those serious issues concern us greatly and I understand the passion they engender.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/8">We are lucky to have in the Colne valley a lot of gravel pits that are used for various things such as sailing and wildlife habitats. I shall visit the Broadwater site in January to see whether anything can be done to relocate the Hillingdon outdoor activities centre there.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/9">I must declare my interest as a member of four wildlife trusts. It is always difficult to balance different interests with different habitats. Apart from looking at the impact of HS2 on my constituency, I will look seriously at its impact on ecology all along the line. Not too far from my constituency, a little further up the line, are colonies of Bechstein&#8217;s bats. That may not seem the most pressing issue, but they are an endangered species in Europe and we must take serious note of that, as well as many other things. Although it is unlikely that Mrs Randall is listening to this debate, I am hoping she knows that on my Christmas list is a bat detector. I now have a bit more time and I am going to try to find where all the bats are. They can be detected by their different frequencies. In the new year, if anyone sees me walking around holding something in my hand outside the House of Commons or in the environs of the Palace, I will be trying to find out &#8220;who&#8217;s bats&#8221; and where they are.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/10">Reading the report earlier, I noticed that HS2 will also impact on the barn owl population, although there are some measures to address that. I hope that when HS2 Ltd looks at such matters, it will take the advice of wildlife trusts, and others, on how to mitigate the impact of the project.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/11">The country can set an example, but on an international scale there is one pressing area in which I know the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been active and where we must keep up the pressure. The Virunga national park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo is threatened because 80% of the land has been allocated for oil concessions. It was, I think, the first wildlife park, and it was set up a long time ago at the beginning of the 20th century. It contains important biodiversity, including mountain gorillas and okapis. We must keep up that pressure, and although it is not strictly within our competence, this country is in a position to lead on those issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/12">Where we do have competence is in our own country, and in the forthcoming months I shall raise the issue of the protection of our upland habitats. England&#8217;s habitats are vital stores of beauty, biodiversity and sequestered carbon, but they seem to be mismanaged. They sustain populations of endangered or critically listed species such as black grouse, curlews, hen harriers and freshwater pearl mussels. Despite the protection that has been afforded in many ways, a lot of bird species have declined in numbers.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/13">While not wishing to seem too ambitious with my Christmas list, I have asked for something else&#8212;in fact, I have actually purchased it to ensure I get it because by and large in this world it is better to make sure we get what we want. It is an excellent piece of work&#8212;a bird atlas&#8212;compiled recently by the British Trust for Ornithology. It is a follow up to a previous work, and before any of us had heard of the big society, this was an example of the big society in action. Volunteers go throughout the British isles, map the bird species they have seen over a period of several years, and then put them into a huge compilation. The important thing this time around is that we can compare it with the previous one, which I think was published 10 years ago, and see exactly what has improved and what species have declined. Some populations have declined dramatically&#8212;the whinchat population is down by 57%; curlews are down by 44%; and lapwings by 32%&#8212;and we have to take note of that. There have been huge reductions in some species. Not all of those problems are man-made. Some are due to climate change. However, there are things we can do.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/14">One of the things that I am most upset about is the striking loss of a species called the hen harrier. The male hen harrier is a magnificent grey creature. The female is also magnificent, but not quite so grey&#8212;more brown, really. It is estimated that its habitat in England could sustain more than 300 pairs. Last year was the first time ever that no hen harriers bred in England&#8212;a direct result, I think, of man&#8217;s intervention. Unfortunately, one habitat that hen harriers like is the grouse moor&#8212;grouse are one of their favoured prey. You can probably sense, Madam Deputy Speaker, where the conflict lies. Grouse moors are managed commercial interests. However, they do not have to be managed quite in the way they are and some offences that are committed will be criminal.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/15">A recent report by the Law Commission set out recommendations following consultation on potential changes to wildlife law. Much in the report was very good. I was a little disappointed to see that it did not go down the line of suggesting that the Government should introduce a provision for vicarious liability, where employers are legally responsible for wildlife crimes committed by their employees. I know that is a contentious subject, and if I was still in the Whips Office I would be tut-tutting because it falls into the &#8220;rather difficult&#8221; category. However, we cannot afford to lose species such as the hen harrier just because commercial interests have taken the view that wildlife is in their way. We must do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/16">The first wildlife laws were introduced in 1954. I am pleased to say that it was 10 years later, in 1964, when I was a very small boy, that I first became a member of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. I have been a member for 50 years. It is an interest that was with me a long time before I gained all the other interests that I mention in this House or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/17">On the subject of crime, legal aid charges for the criminal Bar have not previously been within my competence or even interest, but I have suddenly become aware of them. Raising this matter will, unfortunately, put me slightly at odds with some of my colleagues, but I think these things have to be said from time to time, and at Christmas they may just forgive me for doing so. I am lucky, because I am not a lawyer&#8212;the legal profession is probably very lucky that I am not one too, but that goes without saying. I have discovered that the criminal Bar and criminal barristers are receiving a real-terms reduction of 30% in very high cost cases, and there are other reductions as well. In real terms, they are losing income. It is very easy for us in this House to think of all barristers as being extremely well paid and that they can afford it and so on. That perception is rather like the one of Members of Parliament: we are portrayed as always being extremely well paid, and that we can do without this and that.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/18">Sometimes the truth is not always the popular perception. In fact, only a few&#8212;a significant few&#8212;earn very high fees. The level of competence in defence cases will be reduced, because chambers will use their most junior members. I apologise to the legal profession for not quite understanding exactly what goes on, because I try to keep well away from the law&#8212;I find, by and large, that that is a useful thing to do. I can see, however, after talking to people, that the reductions could lead almost to the extinction of the self-employed criminal Bar as a specialist referral profession of excellence. There will be an increase in cost to the taxpayer eventually, even though the reason for the reductions is to make savings; I will come back to the issue of savings in a moment. There might also be an impact on the quality of the judiciary, because the judiciary are promoted from the criminal Bar and people will have been taken out of the system. What worries me most is that what we value most highly in this country is, I think, our legal system: the jury system and the fact that people can get a high-quality defence when they need it.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/19">I understand why we have to make savings&#8212; Mr Micawber was right. I also understand, however, that there are costs involved with prisoners not turning up on time. I am sure that if I was sitting on the Opposition Benches I might mention some of the organisations, which are more private than public, that are responsible for bringing prisoners to court. The interpreter system is costly and sometimes interpreters are not always there at the right time. Any delays in the court system&#8212;aside from the potential misery caused to defendants, the prosecution and witnesses&#8212;bring with them a large element of cost. That all has to be looked at, and I will return to that. I may have to do a bit more work on understanding how it all works&#8212;I always think that when people talk about the Bar, they are talking about something else, but I shall have to move away from old habits.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/20">Moving effortlessly on to my final remarks, as I mentioned earlier to my hon. Friend the Member for Southend West, one of my previous roles was Chair of the Joint Committee on Security. In that role, I found a greater understanding of how this place is secured and looked after. I would like to thank publicly the work of the police and the security people in this place. I would also like to thank the Metropolitan police. I was listening</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/21">to the &#8220;Today&#8221; programme earlier and the Metropolitan police have not had the best of years. That always happens when one or two things have gone wrong, or when there has been a bad apple. That can happen, as we know, in every walk of life and in every profession. We should not lose our faith in the Metropolitan police and we should thank them for what they do. While we are back at home on Christmas day, or whatever we are doing over Christmas, police will be guarding the Palace of Westminster. They will be outside Downing street, whatever the weather, and potentially subject to real threats. I remember going out with the police a few years ago. They had just had a call through to go to a pub where a big fight was going on. They did not know what to expect&#8212;there could have been knives or firearms&#8212;but they went out of the van unarmed. We owe them all a huge debt of gratitude. I still think, as I am sure many other Members do, that we have the finest police service in the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.944.0/22">I would also like to thank publicly&#8212;because they are not seen publicly&#8212;the civil servants who helped me when I was in the Whips Office, both in opposition and, more especially, in government. They were wonderful. They had to put up with all sorts of things going on. Do not think for one minute, Mr Deputy Speaker, that government is anything but a smooth and efficient operation without crises and so on, but occasionally such things might happen, and at those times two people in particular, Mr Roy Stone and Mr Mark Kelly, have been on hand. Normally they work under the title of &#8220;the usual channels&#8221;, but they are more than that; they are absolutely unusual in their devotion to duty and their abilities. I would like to put on the record my thanks to them.</p>

	<p pid="b.948.2/1">I want briefly to talk about eating disorders, a subject that I have become aware of in detail recently and which deserves a lot more time. I have done a wee bit of research, and although it might have been discussed at length in this place, I do not know that it has, so I think it deserves more time. I will briefly mention it now, and then perhaps go away, do a bit more research and come back to speak about it in the new year.

	<p pid="b.949.1/1">No way. I cannot believe that level of cynicism, to be perfectly honest. We all research our subjects well before speaking.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.1/2">I recently became aware of several such cases in the UK, including in the English health system&#8212;I am not simply talking about my own constituency, in Scotland, where this is a devolved issue. The number of young people suffering from eating disorders, particularly anorexia, has grown considerably. They tend to be in their early teens and they tend to be girls, although not always. It becomes obvious to parents when their child loses a substantial amount of weight, which can happen quickly, and there are various patterns that are easily observed. In the first few stages, it will sometimes seem that the child is trying to lose weight, perhaps to fit into a dress, because of fashion imperatives or whatever. Some weight is lost quite quickly, and the parents will be watching, but not necessarily thinking it a medical issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.1/3">Then it continues. Over a brief period of perhaps three or four months, I child can lose 25% of their body weight. A child who is, say, 8 stone or 8 stone 2 lbs can drop below 6 stone very quickly before the parents have grasped what is going on. Then, they will alert their local GP, who might, or might not, be completely switched on to the subject, and in due course, they might, or might not, get a referral to local services dealing with that kind of thing. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">The hon. Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase> briefly referred to mental health services in his area. The configuration of those services is pretty much the same in most areas, as far as I can see, although they operate slightly differently in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.1/4">By the time it gets to the NHS, the problem will usually be quite advanced. Often, if the child continues to refuse to eat, they will be admitted to accident and emergency in a period of weeks because their vital organs will be starting to fail, and they will be going slightly mad&#8212;that is my non-clinical term. The essence of it is that once a child gets to that stage, it is very hard and takes a long time for them to recover, because people have to persuade them of the common sense of eating&#8212;that it is good for them, that they should treat food like they would medicine. It will take years and years to get that child back on track, if ever they do get back on track, so it is essential that the disorder is identified earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.1/5">It is clear from reading papers by excellent organisations such as Beat that there is a gap in provision. Beat is an organisation that works on this issue, and I urge Members to google it and look at its website. The gap in provision is no one&#8217;s fault, as such; it is simply that the NHS, despite a considerable increase in funding over the past 10 or 12 years, is hard pressed. It works its budget hard, but by the time people approach the local services for those with eating disorders, they do not have the resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.1/6">This is a subject that should concern everyone in this place. Having spoken to a lot of people about this, I have noticed that if someone has a child heading towards being admitted to A and E, their best chance is to put them in a private hospital using private resources. There is a clear pattern. The NHS will do what it can, but if someone can afford private health care, the child will stand a much better chance. This is not just about</p>
	<p pid="b.949.1/7">jumping the queue or opting for minor elective surgery; it is about life and death&#8212;some 20% of sufferers actually die&#8212;and the well-being of young men and women over many years. If a parent can beg, borrow or steal the cash, my advice, unquestionably, would be to use private provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.1/8">We should all be sitting up and paying attention to that, because it is clear that the relevant services in the NHS are overwhelmed. Hon. Members might have a few cases, but my instinct is that we will all have more of them in the relatively near future, because it is a growth area. People are still not terribly sure what eating disorders are, but I can assure hon. Members, from the cases I have looked at, that they are devastating for those involved, and it is clear&#8212;this is what worries me most&#8212;that private provision is people&#8217;s best chance. The NHS should look carefully at how it resources its relevant mental health services for eating disorders.</p>
	<p pid="b.949.1/9">I will stop there, Mr Deputy Speaker, except to wish you and every Member of the House a wild and crazy, or quiet and pleasant, Christmas.</p>

From my point of view, as an ex-Cheshire officer, we will get a huge number of Victoria Crosses when the Staffords join us; my regiment only has two.</p>

	<p pid="b.950.2/1">I am most grateful to my hon. Friend. We all share his sentiments, and our thoughts and prayers are with 3 Mercian and the other regiments and units serving in Afghanistan, including the tactical supply wing of the RAF, which is also based in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/2">I want to dwell for a moment on the report of the trust special administrators into the Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, which came out yesterday. There are a number of good things in the report. Within the remit they were given&#8212;I think that that will need to be considered by this House because it needs quite a lot of change&#8212;they have done some good things. Those include recommending a merger of the University Hospital of North Staffordshire with the Stafford element of the Mid-Staffordshire Foundation Trust. They have also recommended that Cannock hospital goes to the Royal Wolverhampton Hospitals Trust. For Stafford, that is a</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/3">good thing. We will become part of a large university hospital trust and be able to share services across a wider area. In addition to the excellent staff that we already have, we will be able to attract high-quality staff from across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/4">We are also retaining our accident and emergency department. At the moment, it is open for only 14 hours a day, but that is better than the nothing that was proposed earlier this year. However, I still believe that we need a 24/7 A and E department. Perhaps our use of the current department will reveal the need for an increase in hours, but at least we have retained the department and we can build on it in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/5">We have also retained acute services. At the start of the year, it was thought that Stafford would become a community hospital&#8212;not an acute hospital. I am glad to say that those fears have not been realised. The recommendations also include, for the first time, provision for a frail elderly unit, which is incredibly important as it builds on the work of the Cure the NHS group, founded by Julie Bailey, and the Francis report that came out as a result of that. I hope it will be a beacon for the care of elderly people across the country. It will show that, in Stafford, we can do such things to the highest standards. We will also have a large range of other services. The trust special administrators have said that 90% or more of current attendees at Stafford and Cannock will be able to continue to use those services. Cannock hospital has also been retained. In fact, more work will go on at Cannock, 60% of which has been unused for many years. I welcome that, as does my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40143" name="Aidan Burley">the Member for Cannock Chase (Mr Burley)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/6">A lot of good things are going on in Stafford, and I welcome that. However&#8212;and this is a big however&#8212;there are things that I oppose and will continue to oppose, the most important of which revolves around paediatric services. Yes, there will be a paediatric assessment unit, but it will be linked with A and E and, therefore, open for only 14 hours a day. That means that children who get sick overnight will have to travel 20 or more miles to the nearest unit. That is not acceptable for my constituents or indeed for the constituents of surrounding constituencies. In addition, it will not be a consultant-led paediatric unit, and it will have no in-patient beds for children. That is a problem for children who turn up at night with serious illnesses, or perhaps a very high temperature. Their parents will be extremely worried and will want their child to be taken in and observed for perhaps a day or two before they return home. If the child&#8217;s condition is more serious, they will want them sent to a major unit such as in Stoke or Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/7">Provision for those who need in-patient child and adolescent mental health services in Staffordshire&#8212;indeed, throughout the country&#8212;is not nearly sufficient. Our general hospital in Stafford takes in a number of such young people, some of whom are suicidal. It should not have to do that, but it takes them in because there is nowhere else for them to go. I do not believe that the administrators&#8217; proposals take that into account, although the issue was raised in the consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/8">The original proposals said that no women could give birth in Stafford, unless they were having a home delivery, but I am glad to say that the administrators</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/9">have listened to the people and have recommended that we should have a midwife-led maternity unit. However, that is still not enough, because we need a consultant-led unit. With our growing town, the Army coming in and the number of houses being built, we will get up to the 2,500 to 3,000 births a year in the coming year, and that will justify such provision, networked together with the University Hospital of North Staffordshire. I will continue to make that case to Monitor and to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/10">The question of the critical care unit was also raised. I am glad to say that the administrators accepted the need for a level 3 critical care unit at Stafford, but we need to look at the details in the report, because I want to ensure that the unit is robust and will be maintained and sustained. There are question marks over that, but as I am not an expert on the matter, I will have to wait for the consultants and clinicians in my constituency to get back to me with the details.</p>
	<p pid="b.950.2/11">I pay tribute to the community in Stafford, Cannock and the surrounding areas who have shown such resilience. When downgrading of the hospital to a community hospital was first proposed, they showed tremendous support for its work. As is well known, the hospital has been greatly troubled over years, but it has come on tremendously in the past two or three years. Only two weeks ago Stafford had the best hospital standardised mortality ratio in the whole of the west midlands. That is a far cry from where it was four or five years ago. I pay great tribute to the community for coming together in marches of up to 50,000 people.</p>

	<p pid="b.952.0/1">Many of the things that the hon. Gentleman describes are of course familiar to me, given that Lewisham also experienced the first ever use of the trust special administration process. Earlier in his remarks, he referred to the remit that the TSA had been given in Staffordshire. He said that that remit may have to be looked at in future. What are his thoughts on clause 118 of the Care Bill, which looks to extend and augment the powers of trust special administrators in the future?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.952.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40573" speakername="Jeremy Lefroy" colnum="952"  time="014:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0002.htm#131219-0002.htm_spnew109">
	<p pid="b.952.1/1">I am pretty sceptical about it. When that Bill comes back to the House, I will make some remarks on it if I am given the opportunity to do so. In fact, I would take my remarks much wider than that. I have written a paper to Monitor on all the faults of the TSA process that I have experienced at first hand. One in particular is that when an administrator is installed, the trust loses its board. The chief executives and the executives lose their support. I am not saying that the TSAs do not try to do some work, but their focus is on the financial side and the future. Inevitably, they are not so focused on running the hospital now, and that is a serious omission. There are many other serious points that I want to make, and I would welcome a debate on the whole matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/2">We have had two experiences of TSAs. One was under the National Health Service Act 2006, which affected Lewisham, and the other was under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, which affected Stafford. We should look at the matter carefully, because there will be others in the future. Indeed, we need to assess whether the whole process of a company-like administration is</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/3">the best way to cope with a failure in the hospital context, and I am pretty sceptical about that. Perhaps we can use our mutual experience to consider that.</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/4">I want to return to the enormous support of the community. It was exemplified in two marches in April and then again in September. There were also rallies, at which I had the honour to speak. Indeed, at a children&#8217;s disco in Stafford, which was organised by the support Stafford hospital group, more than 200 children and their families came together to show their support for the paediatric services offered by the hospital. We have come a long way since the beginning of the year with our support for the hospital and, more importantly, for the services for my constituents, but we have much more to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/5">I want to touch on a number of other areas that affect my constituents. We have already heard today at some length about High Speed 2. I will not go into too many details other than to say that the railway line runs straight through four villages in my constituency. I understand the national need for increased capacity, but I do not think that this is the right solution. I wish that the approach to HS2 and rail capacity had been similar to that of aviation. Instead, what we seem to do with railway capacity is to come up with a solution and then look around for problems for it to address. With aviation, we are doing it the other way around, although I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> and others might not necessarily agree with some of the solutions. On rail, we need to look again at whether this line drawn on a map is the right line.</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/6">We also need to consider mitigation measures and compensation. It comes back to what I have said time and time again to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport: we need to be reasonable and fair in our compensation, as the French are with such schemes, not miserly. I am afraid that I have seen instances of my constituents who were dealt with in a less than generous manner when their whole life was affected. We are talking about a railway the construction of which is not due to start in my constituency until 2026. That means 30 years of blight and waiting for this thing to happen, if it ever does.</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/7">I also want to mention Staffordshire university. It has an important campus in my town, but it is considering moving away from it, perhaps partially and perhaps fully. That would be a major error. The university is very good for Stafford and Stafford is very good for the university. When it was a polytechnic in the 1960s, it was one of the first in the country to introduce a course in computing, through English Electric. It has produced many fine graduates over the years. I will continue to support tertiary education in Stafford with all my might and I hope that it will continue to be provided by Staffordshire university.</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/8">Let me also raise the question of a western access road in Stafford. I was talking to somebody from a neighbouring village last night who said that they never come to Stafford because of the congestion and traffic. That is partly because of the popularity of the town, but it also shows that the road network&#8212;the town has two rivers, a canal and two main line railways, the one from Birmingham and the west coast main line, that merge&#8212;has an infrastructure problem. The western access road, for which we need &#163;25 million, would help</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/9">in some way to alleviate the congestion and make Stafford an even more attractive place for people to come to.</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/10">Many good things have happened this year in Stafford. The unemployment rate for jobseekers has fallen to 2.2% from about 3.6% three years ago. The number of apprentices has more than doubled in the past two years. Two new business parks are being built. I apologise to my constituents for the problems with traffic congestion that those roadworks are causing, but the parks will result in many hundreds if not thousands of highly skilled jobs being created for the area. We had the great news earlier this year that two more signal regiments will come to Stafford from 2015, with 1,000 servicemen and women and their families. Stafford is a very loyal town that is tremendously supportive of the armed forces and we will welcome them with open arms.</p>
	<p pid="b.952.1/11">We also have a town centre development that will, I hope, start fairly soon. A brand new Marks and Spencer, a brand new Debenhams and many other shops will be coming to the town centre. We are also seeing housing development. I am not someone who believes that we should not build many more houses&#8212;we need more houses for our young people and families. However, they need to be the right kind of houses. We need to ensure that they are fit for older people, who might want smaller properties, less of a garden or a bungalow so that it is all on one level. We need to build houses that enable families to have a side room or side apartment to care for relatives. We need to be imaginative.</p>

	<p pid="b.954.0/1">My hon. Friend is making a very good speech about his constituency. As he is talking about house building, may I make a plea as someone who might well have to go out in delivery vans with furniture in the next few days? They make the doors smaller now and it is impossible to get a three-piece suite through them.</p>

	<p pid="b.954.1/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. I have been out with the Staffordshire furniture exchange twice in the past two years and I have the same problem getting furniture through the doors.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/2">I also welcome the new care village being built in the north of Stafford, with different levels of residential care. That is being pioneered by Staffordshire county council and I would welcome any hon. Member who wants to come along and see what is being done there. I believe that it is a template for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/3">That brings me to the subject of our local councils: South Staffordshire district council, Stafford borough council and Staffordshire county council, led by Brian Edwards, Mike Heenan and Philip Atkins respectively. They have all taken some difficult but far-reaching decisions over the past few years in difficult times and have been able to balance the books and to maintain and improve services.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/4">While we are on the subject of housing, I want to bring up one matter that has proved contentious in politics in the past few months&#8212;that is, the question of the spare room rent, the spare room subsidy, the bedroom tax or whatever one wants to call it. There has been a lot of understandable debate in the House and I believe that we will need to consider the issue quite carefully. The principle of it is based on what the previous Government introduced in the private sector, and I</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/5">believe that that principle is probably right. However, the percentage of rent that has been introduced at the beginning results in genuine difficulty in many parts of the country. Eventually, a decision will have to be taken on whether it will result in a no-eviction policy or in evictions.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/6">I urge the Government to consider how, without getting rid of a policy that has real merit in helping people to move into other accommodation, they can deal with the fact that the cost of 14% or 25% of rent is far too high for most people at the beginning, particularly when there are no other properties for them to move in to. I will leave that one in the air as it is slightly off my subject of Stafford, although it affects my constituency and those of other colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/7">Let me conclude&#8212;I can see that you are impatient for me to do so, Mr Deputy Speaker&#8212;by talking a little about the international scene. As a member of the Select Committee on International Development&#8212;I am honoured by that membership and I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40280" name="Malcolm Bruce">the Member for Gordon (Sir Malcolm Bruce)</phrase> for his excellent leadership of the Committee&#8212;I have been privileged enough to see some of the excellent work that the Department for International Development has been doing around the world. I pay particular tribute to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development for her work.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/8">I was glad to see that yesterday the UK announced strong support for the International Development Association, the World Bank fund for the poorest countries in the world. Under the previous Government, the UK was, rightly, the largest and second largest donor at various times and we have maintained leadership in that regard. It is an extremely important multilateral fund that was given a great deal of praise in the multilateral aid review produced by the Government in 2010. It is vital for tens of millions of people around the world, whether it is helping them to access better health care, better education or better sanitation&#8212;all those matters on which this House rightly places such importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/9">In my role as chairman of the all-party group on malaria and neglected tropical diseases, I commend the Government on the tremendous work they have done, following on from that of the previous Government, to support work in malaria research and intervention around the world. Indeed, they have increased the amount provided for the neglected tropical diseases that blight the lives of some 1.4 billion people around the world, which can often be tackled for a limited amount of money&#8212;sometimes less than $1 per person per year.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/10">Recently in the House we have had some excellent debates on religious persecution. I commend all those who have spoken on the subject and brought it to the attention of the House. I believe that it is something that the House needs constantly to consider. Indeed, His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales has spoken eloquently about it in recent days. I believe that this House has a leadership role to play not just in this country but internationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/11">At this time, we should not forgot those who are suffering&#8212;irrespective of their faith or indeed if they be of no faith&#8212;particularly in Syria. It is vital that we do not accept the situation in Syria as if it were somehow normal. We must not allow this killing, which goes on</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/12">day in, day out, to be viewed in the same way as Biafra, Vietnam and all the other seemingly endless crises were when I was a boy. We almost became immune to them, but let us never become immune to this horror. Unfortunately, we are seeing it in the Central African Republic and the killing has started again in South Sudan. Whatever else this House does, it is vital for it to bring these matters to public and international attention time and time again. If we do not do it, often nobody else will, including other Parliaments around the world. I truly believe this is vital.</p>
	<p pid="b.954.1/13">I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, your colleagues and all House staff for the work they do; I wish all a very happy Christmas, and thank you for your indulgence.</p>

	<p pid="b.956.0/1">It is an honour to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40573" name="Jeremy Lefroy">the hon. Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy)</phrase>, who has entertained us with a very thoughtful speech this afternoon. I am going to follow up the health theme, but my discussion of it is going to be a little more graphic. If any hon. Ladies or hon. Gentlemen wish to leave, I shall not take it as a personal affront. They might find it more comfortable to go off and get a cup of tea.</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/2">I want to talk about hysteroscopy, particularly when undertaken without anaesthetic. This topic was brought to my attention by my constituent, Debbie, who lives in Plaistow. She was diagnosed with womb cancer or uterine cancer last year. She contacted me because the process of diagnosis, rather than the cancer itself, caused her</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/3">&#8220;the most distressing and painful experience&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/4">of her life. Debbie underwent a procedure called hysteroscopy, which looks inside a patient&#8217;s uterus and is used to investigate symptoms such as pelvic pain, abnormal bleeding and infertility. Biopsies are often taken and tissue is often removed. The patient&#8217;s vagina is opened with a speculum, as during a cervical smear test, and a hysteroscope is inserted. A hysteroscope is a thin tube with a light and camera on the end, as well as any other instruments that might be needed. As I am sure I need hardly point out, this procedure is highly uncomfortable and clearly has the potential to be very painful indeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/5">At present, the NHS Choices website explains,</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/6">&#8220;a hysteroscopy should not hurt, but women may want to take a pain killer such as ibuprofen beforehand&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/7">As well as having a hysteroscopy as an out-patient procedure, the NHS website says that</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/8">&#8220;the procedure can also be carried out under general anaesthetic, which may be recommended if your surgeon expects to do extensive treatment at the same time or if you request it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/9">So far, this sounds fairly reasonable: it will not necessarily be pleasant, but there are options and the procedure can be carried out with or without pain relief and with or without local or general anaesthetic.</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/10">Let me tell Debbie&#8217;s story in more detail. Through Debbie, I have also heard stories from other women across the country. Debbie told me:</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/11">&#8220;I was in absolute agony. The consultant who performed my procedure knew I was in pain but carried on regardless. A nurse had to push me back down on the bed as I stiffened like a board. She had to hold me there and had hold of my hands too as I was trying to reach down and stop the procedure. All I could think</p>
	<p pid="b.956.0/12">was that if I made the consultant stop, I would have to come back and endure the whole thing again. This procedure, without anaesthesia, is barbaric. It is absolute torture. It needs to be stopped. At the very least, the patient should be informed that it could be extremely painful and have options explained and open for her. That way, she can make an informed decision as to whether to go ahead without anaesthesia.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.957.0/1">That sounds absolutely horrific. The hon. Lady did not explain whether Debbie was asked whether she would like a general anaesthetic. I presume that she was not asked and that the procedure went ahead without it.</p>

	<p pid="b.957.1/1">Her very next sentence explains that:</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/2">&#8220;I was given no options. I have complained to the PALS department and to be quite honest I am not happy with their reply. At one point it mentions that the hospital gets more money for the procedure to be done as an outpatient! Is this what it boils down to? Money? Disgusting!&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/3">Jan from Cheshire said:</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/4">&#8220;I had a hysteroscopy in Cheshire. This hospital is a private hospital but I was there as an NHS patient, as it was the hospital that my doctor could get me into the quickest, for investigations into abnormal bleeding. I saw the consultant in September of 2011, and was given an evening appointment to attend for a hysteroscopy, and was told that the procedure would be done under local anaesthetic. At the evening appointment, I was given a local anaesthetic, but after several attempts at performing the hysteroscopy, the consultant apologised and said that she was unable to perform the procedure and did not want to attempt it again under a local anaesthetic as, in her words, &#8216;it would be inhumane to continue under a local&#8217;. I was sent home and told to take co-codamol for pain relief, and that I was to return the next day for the procedure to be done under a general anaesthetic. I have got to say that even though I had a local anaesthetic&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/5">if Members have been paying attention, they will know that my constituent Debbie was not offered that&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/6">&#8220;the procedure was still very uncomfortable and painful. I have to say that I think offering a hysteroscopy without any form of anaesthetic is barbaric.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/7">Jo from Chesterfield said:</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/8">&#8220;I had already had biopsies done in clinic with no anaesthetic, done like a smear with swabs but going through the cervix. I had found this painful but nothing prepared me for what was to come. I had been given a leaflet to outline the procedure but it mentioned nothing about pain or discomfort. I was asked to go behind a make-shift cubicle in the corner, take everything off and put on a gown. I was then asked to sit in a contraption that looked like some Victorian birthing chair, it was very uncomfortable and awkward to sit in. I felt so undignified&#8230;I have never felt such pain. I felt like my whole abdomen had been blown up, the pressure was so intense, then sharp prodding pains, I had tears in my eyes, the nurse did come and hold my hand. I just looked at the ceiling and held my breath, praying for it to be over.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/9">When he&#8217;d done, the doctor asked &#8216;did you find that a bit painful?&#8217;. I replied &#8216;no it was excruciating&#8217;, he just remarked that most women are fine with it but perhaps I had a low pain threshold and that if I were to need further treatment I would need a General Anaesthetic as I was sensitive. I was quite gob smacked and in so much pain I didn&#8217;t really reply. I struggled to my car and drove home, I was in agony for days. I felt almost like I&#8217;d been violated, like a piece of meat, but thought perhaps it was just me, perhaps I was being a wuss. It wasn&#8217;t till I spoke to other ladies that I discovered it needn&#8217;t have been this way. My treatment on a whole I feel was done very wrongly, cutting corners and saving money, at my expense. The hysteroscopy should not have been done this way, it&#8217;s almost inhumane.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/10">Katharine from Bath said:</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/11">&#8220;My GP referred me for day-case hysteroscopy under local anaesthetic&#8230;He told me to pay for a course of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy to lower my Blood Pressure to qualify me for NHS</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/12">day-care surgery as opposed to more expensive NHS inpatient surgery. During the Cognitive Behavioural Therapy the psychologist told me to go straight to the gynae-oncology surgeon at the hospital and have my persistent inter-menstrual bleeding properly investigated. My GP was furious at this suggestion but eventually gave in. The gynae-oncology surgeon told me that &#8216;you&#8217;ve had it for so long it won&#8217;t be anything sinister&#8217;. He eventually agreed to an inpatient hysteroscopy under General anaesthetic. I waited months for the operation. It showed late stage womb cancer which had spread to the lymph nodes. I had a radical hysterectomy and a long course of external radiotherapy&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/13">Jenny from Barnsley said:</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/14">&#8220;I went into the clinic and was given an ultrasound and very quickly was approached by a senior registrar who said I had a very thick womb but they could do a biopsy there and then.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/15">My GP had mentioned that this procedure can be difficult but they would give me a local anaesthetic.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/16">To be honest I was in such shock. I was led into a room where there was a very nice sister and nurse. I sat in a chair and the senior registrar began by filling my womb with water.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/17">Then the hell began when they inserted whatever and did the biopsy. I have not experienced such pain even in childbirth and I told her so. I also said my GP had said they would give me some local anaesthetic and then she asked if I wanted some. Rather like closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. It was too late then as they were in there.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/18">The sister told me she nearly stopped the doctor. They were very caring then but only offered me one paracetamol. They said to me don&#8217;t let the woman who is waiting outside see you or it might put her off.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/19">The 21-year-old sister of Michelle, from Scotland, went for a hysteroscopy after noticing some bleeding after intercourse. The gynaecologist asked a nurse to assist while he proceeded to perform a rather forceful examination, and then carried out the hysteroscopy with no warning or pain relief. Michelle received a phone call from her distraught sister, who had gone into shock in the car park, had passed out next to her car, and was bleeding.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/20">Gillian in Leeds said:</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/21">&#8220;Before the procedure, I received a leaflet with my appointment letter&#8212;no mention of any general or local anaesthetic, but after what the doctor had told me I wasn&#8217;t expecting it to be too bad&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/22">She said that the nurse</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/23">&#8220;managed to get the hysteroscope through my cervical opening&#8230;when she took each sample&#8212;6 in total&#8212;my pain level shot through the roof.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/24">&#8220;What...infuriates me most is the fact that SOME people are given pain relief as a matter of course at their hospitals&#8230;why the hell should I, and others, have to suffer just because of which hospital we went to?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/25">Patricia from Fife said:</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/26">&#8220;I was offered no pain relief and the Dr. who did it didn&#8217;t get enough in the end so I had to go under general anaesthetic to get it done again.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/27">The procedure that she experienced, while conscious,</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/28">&#8220;was very traumatic and painful&#8230;I felt them cutting away the biopsy inside&#8230;afterwards the nurse who had held me down said to me &#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t have let them do that to me without a general anaesthetic&#8217; so why did she let me go through it?&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/29">Maureen from Norwich said:</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/30">&#8220;The letter&#8230;advised I took either ibuprofen, or paracetamol about two hours before the appointment. The scan showed something abnormal, so I waited and then saw a very nice lady doctor. I then went on to endure the procedure, it took about fifteen minutes and it was certainly a lot more than uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/31">She felt very sick, and was in pain, but</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/32">&#8220;the nurse who was there kept saying how well I was doing. I was at the limit of my endurance, only the thought of having to go back again stopped me from asking the procedure to be stopped.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/33">I have received so much correspondence about this issue, via my friend Debbie, that I could speak at length and give many more examples, because what I wanted to do today was give those women a voice. However, I think that the House will understand the direction in which I am going.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/34">Some women have received no pain treatment at all&#8212;no anaesthetic to dull the pain. Some have received a local anaesthetic, but, given the severity of their conditions, a number of them have found that that is not enough. Others have received a general anaesthetic, either on request or because their doctors were aware that the procedure involved might be more extensive than had been expected. A study of a group of women conducted over five years in Melbourne established that over 10% of the group would not accept a local anaesthetic again, because of the pain and the need for the procedure to be repeated owing to a failure to secure a biopsy sample.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/35">I have found it difficult to obtain information about this issue, but I think that certain facts are clear. Some women are being given no pain relief options at all. That aspect is not being explained to them by the doctor when they get to the hospital. Some feel that they are not being treated with compassion and respect, and that very little or no consideration is given to their dignity or their well-being. Some are experiencing a procedure that fails and needs to be repeated. One has to ask how often that happens, and what the cost is to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/36">Some women are clearly receiving treatment that is not in line with the guidelines issued by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, which acknowledges that</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/37">&#8220;outpatient hysteroscopy can be associated with significant pain, anxiety and embarrassment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.957.1/38">While the RCOG&#8217;s guidelines emphasise throughout that it is possible for women to have an acceptable out-patient experience, and some women do, there is clearly a serious problem, in that the current standard practice is failing a significant group of women very badly. It is appalling that, in some cases, no pain relief is even offered. I have read a range of the information leaflets that various hospitals offer to support their hysteroscopy out-patient clinics, and I am glad to note that local anaesthetic is mentioned in almost all of them, but they are not open enough about the pain that women may experience during and after the procedure, and there is inadequate reference to the option of undergoing the procedure with a general anaesthetic.</p>

	<p pid="b.959.1/1">I honestly cannot answer that question, although I can say that at the different times in my life when I have had internal examinations the pain has varied, and that as I have got older, the examinations have become more painful. I have been told by some</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/2">women who have had babies&#8212;which, sadly, I have failed to do&#8212;that they have found the examinations less painful after their pregnancies. However, some have told me that they become more painful with the menopause. Indeed, when my mother had a similar examination, she told me that it had been excruciating, and that was when she was quite old.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/3">I am not sure that there are any research findings out there that would answer the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s very sympathetic question&#8212;certainly I have not found any&#8212;and I think that this is something that we need to know more about. However, a study published by the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in 2009 concluded that a local anaesthetic injection was the best method of pain control for women undergoing hysteroscopies as out-patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.959.1/4">I have struggled to decide what I need to ask the Government to do in order to ensure that women receive the best possible care and treatment while undergoing this procedure. It is difficult for me to know that, because I am not a medic. However, I do think it is reasonable to ask the Government to use all the influence they have over policy in this area to require the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to work with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to issue authoritative guidelines. I also think the Care Quality Commission may well have a role to play in ensuring that best practice is delivered locally at each hospital.</p>

	<p pid="b.961.0/1">It is an honour to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40650" name="Lyn Brown">the hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase>. Last night I endured the great pain of West Ham inflicting a second home defeat on Tottenham in a season, which has not been known since I have been alive. At the beginning of her speech, I wondered whether the pain that the ladies she mentioned were going through was anything like the emotional pain I felt last night, but my pain pales into insignificance compared with what women are being put through at the hands of the NHS, and I thank her for bringing that matter to the House&#8217;s attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.961.0/2">It is the great benefit of these debates that we can bring matters that otherwise would not be aired to the Chamber. At this time of year, when we often think of ourselves, our parties and our families, we should also think of those underprivileged people who are less fortunate than ourselves. I shall concentrate on the private rented sector, the overuse of beds in sheds and the massive overcrowding in many parts of the country, which is a growing menace to the whole of our society.</p>
	<p pid="b.961.0/3">It is a fact of life that 9 million people now rent their homes right across England. That is fine and people make that choice&#8212;or alternatively, they have no choice. In my own borough of Harrow there are now twice as many privately rented homes as there are homes in the entire socially rented sector, whether it be council or housing association properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.961.0/4">I am a member of the Communities and Local Government Committee. When we looked at the private rented sector, one of the problems highlighted in the evidence we received was that the poorer quality of the private rented sector housing damages the health and well-being of the people who live in those homes. The English housing survey conducted earlier this year shows that properties in the private rented sector have the lowest proportion of the three standard insulation measures&#8212;cavity wall insulation, good loft insulation and full double-glazing&#8212;and they are most likely to fall into the lowest energy efficiency bands. Over a third of private rented homes are not classified as meeting the decent homes standard. We would not expect people to live in socially rented accommodation of that standard, and the number of private rented homes is almost double that of socially rented homes. At the same time, almost one in five fail the housing health and safety tests, compared with just 9% of social sector dwellings. Also, damp is more likely to be found in private rented sector accommodation than in any other type of housing, and it is less likely to be dealt with by landlords. That is a scandal that must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.961.0/5">There are currently few requirements on landlords, and few ways in which tenants can complain about a property and get things put right. Tenants often refuse to complain about the quality of a property because the landlord could evict them rather than fixing the problem. These problems often befall those on the lowest incomes,</p>
	<p pid="b.961.0/6">who have the least choice about where to live. They and their families therefore have to live in unacceptable conditions. Landlords often evict tenants without reasonable cause, and the tenants have no right of redress, even when they have not caused a problem. Tenants do not have the rights that they probably should have.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.962.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" speakername="Jeremy Corbyn" colnum="962"  time="014:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spnew12">
	<p pid="b.962.0/1">I am listening to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s speech with interest. I intend to follow much the same theme when I speak later. Does he agree that one of the many problems associated with the private rented sector is the six-month assured shorthold tenancy? It gives the landlord no incentive to respond to a tenant&#8217;s demands and, because the tenant has no security of tenure after the six months, they are unlikely to complain. Also, the tenant has no incentive to do anything in the community because their prospects of remaining in the area are so limited.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.962.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" speakername="Bob Blackman" colnum="962"  time="014:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spnew13">
	<p pid="b.962.1/1">When we were gathering evidence for our report, the Communities and Local Government Committee went to Berlin, where people have much longer tenancies and where a partnership approach is taken between the tenant and the landlord. That is a much more appropriate way of dealing with these matters. Unfortunately, the use of six-month assured shorthold tenancies has grown in this country, more often than not to protect landlords by giving them the right to evict a tenant and recover the property if they so choose. These concerns clearly need to be addressed. We need longer tenancies that give greater assurance to tenants and place greater responsibility on landlords. It would also be helpful if landlords became members of the housing ombudsman service. In that way, they would be more likely to carry out the necessary work and the tenant would have a means of complaining if that did not happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.1/2">I am sure that all hon. Members have houses in multiple occupation in their constituencies. When five or more persons form two or more households in a building, it is a requirement for the landlord to register that property as an HMO. Unfortunately, there can be all sorts of issues involved, including whether fire safety standards are being met. It is a fact of life that, under the terms of the Housing Act 1985, the maximum penalty for operating an unlicensed HMO is currently &#163;20,000. In my borough, there are 89 registered HMOs. I encountered a case three weeks ago in which a three-bedroom semi-detached property was found to be housing no fewer than 11 adults, none of whom was connected in a family sense. They were sharing bedrooms and all the other facilities, and they were each paying &#163;160 a week in rent. That was a nice little earner for the landlord. The property was not registered as an HMO. There are now 100 such cases under investigation in Harrow, and I believe that they represent the tip of a very large iceberg.</p>

	<p pid="b.962.2/1">I recognise much of what the hon. Gentleman is saying. Those problems are certainly replicated in Newham. During the last Parliament, I tried to get HMOs reclassified according to the actual occupancy, rather than to the size of the house. Does he agree that such a reclassification would be very helpful?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.962.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" speakername="Bob Blackman" colnum="962"  time="014:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spnew15">
	<p pid="b.962.3/1">I agree completely that that is one remedy we have to take on board.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.3/2">I cannot speak about what is happening outside London, but in London the charges for HMO applications vary: Harrow council charges &#163;1,200 for an application, which lasts for five years, and then there is an &#163;850 renewal fee; Brent, our near neighbour, charges between &#163;800 and &#163;1,200, depending on the licence length; Ealing charges &#163;970 plus &#163;30 per habitable room; and Lewisham charges &#163;180 per unit of accommodation, up to &#163;1,800. Non-London authorities seem to charge much less. The fee seems to be discretionary and a council could drop it to encourage registrations, thus enabling properties to be examined and tenants to be protected.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.3/3">As we have seen, we also face a challenge on beds in sheds. The Prime Minister was taken this week to a property in Southall that would have disgraced a third world country, yet a number of individuals were being forced to live in incredible conditions there. The Government have taken some action to try to close down beds in sheds, but often we are talking about illegal immigrants in accommodation tied to a job they are undertaking, which is provided through gangmasters and the equivalent. In addition, service providers such as local authorities and the health service are being forced to provide services without any income coming in; these properties will attract a certain amount of council tax, but not the sort of sum they should, given the number of people living in them.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.3/4">Last May, &#163;1.8 million was given to nine councils to tackle the problem of beds in sheds; Brent, Ealing, Hillingdon, Hounslow, Newham, Peterborough, Redbridge, Slough and Southwark were all given money. The trouble is that that addresses only the tip of the iceberg; it does not address all the other boroughs where the problem is occurring. Ealing subsequently stated that it had carried out 4,500 site inspections in a year, in addition to unannounced fortnightly raids, but unfortunately the landlords were running rings around the officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.3/5">In February, a BBC &#8220;Inside Out&#8221; investigation found two high street estate agents renting out beds in sheds without residential planning permission, including one in Willesden Green, in Brent. Rent payments of &#163;1,000 per month were being taken. It was noted that the owners often claim that these converted buildings are more than four years old and so cannot have planning enforcement taken against them by the local authority.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.3/6">Some actions have been taken across England on this issue. Slough borough council spent &#163;24,000 on conducting a heat map across the borough during the early hours of the morning. That identified 6,139 properties where it was believed that beds in sheds were operating&#8212;that is just in one borough, which shows the extent of the scandal. The hon. Member for West Ham referred to Newham, and the Communities and Local Government Committee has taken evidence about the action that its mayor and council are taking to identify and take enforcement action against the outhouses that are being put up without planning approval. I believe that that work has been extended to tackle other illegal activities by landlords. I understand that over the past year the council has taken 80 enforcement actions on beds in sheds, but a further 230 are still pending against properties in multiple occupation, which shows the extent of the problem in one London borough. We might have extended</p>
	<p pid="b.962.3/7">negotiations with landlords, but it seems as if these rogue landlords, who give other private landlords a bad name, need to have stringent action taken against them.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.3/8">We must also consider the fire risk. The London fire brigade has estimated that over the past four years there have been 341 fires in buildings that appear to have had people living in them when they should not have been. Those blazes have caused nine deaths and 58 serious injuries.</p>
	<p pid="b.962.3/9">I have mentioned the fact that illegal immigrants are often in such properties. We might reason why that would be. Migrants who are not here legally are often given low-paid jobs, are paid in cash and have insufficient income to pay the normal rents for accommodation, so they take accommodation from the employer or gangmaster in order to maintain their presence here. They also want to be able to send money home to their families. They are kept in poor conditions, under threat of being reported to the authorities and sent home. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence of people traffickers accommodating their victims in illegal structures, particularly in the London borough of Ealing. Furthermore, if the trafficked victims escape and get work as undocumented migrants, they may resort to living in illegal structures anyway because the rents are often lower and more affordable from their low earnings.</p>

The action that the council has taken over the past couple of years has been important and effective in probably saving lives. We had a death in a shed from a fire way back before 2010. Local schools tell me anecdotally that people who are here legally and who have status are not necessarily aware of their rights. People who have come from abroad and are living here on very low incomes are exploited by the unscrupulous landlords he has been talking about.</p>

	<p pid="b.964.1/1">Clearly, as the hon. Lady says, people who are here legally and have the proper status are often not aware of their complete rights and therefore are exploited by unscrupulous individuals acting as landlords.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.1/2">One of the consequences of the changes in housing benefit has been to encourage young people under the age of 35 to go into shared accommodation because that is the only rate of housing benefit they will qualify for. I welcome that as a move towards ensuring that accommodation is used properly, but as more and more people share housing in the private rented sector, there is the unfortunate consequence of overuse and overcrowding of such properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.1/3">Under the right circumstances a local authority may be able to force a landlord to repay rent or housing benefits if an HMO is unlicensed. Unfortunately, it appears that this is not well known among the public or even among London authorities or councils outside London. If it were know about, it would immediately dissuade landlords from taking in vulnerable people on benefits and exploiting them.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.1/4">What do we do about the problem? It is up to local authorities to enforce the rules. If a landlord is operating an HMO&#8212;I have written to my council about a huge number of properties that I suspect are HMOs but are unlicensed&#8212;appropriate and stringent enforcement action needs to be taken to fine the landlord and to make sure</p>
	<p pid="b.964.1/5">that the properties are brought up to a decent standard. A clear attitude should be adopted towards rogue landlords who give good landlords a terrible name.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.1/6">Proper advice needs to be given to people who rent properties so that they understand their rights, what they can demand and what they can take on. There should be accreditation and licensing for private landlords, particularly those that choose to operate HMOs. It should be for Government and the Department to ensure that tenants and landlords are educated about their rights and responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.964.1/7">There is hope on the horizon. There was a case in which a landlord, who happens to live in my constituency, was operating a property empire in the neighbouring borough of Brent, where he put 28 flats into four houses. He was prosecuted and ordered to pay &#163;303,112 under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. This demonstrates that local authorities can use their power to stop rogue landlords in their tracks and take appropriate action. Rogue landlords will listen to only one thing: losing their income and assets. We must ensure that the people living in those properties are given decent facilities to live in.</p>

	<p pid="b.965.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making an important contribution. Does he agree that it would be a good idea to have much better co-ordination between London boroughs, perhaps through the Mayor&#8217;s office, on chasing down rogue landlords and, as the Select Committee recommended, to have a much simpler form of harmonisation for all the regulations so that landlords and tenants know their rights within the existing law, never mind those that might be introduced in future?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.965.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" speakername="Bob Blackman" colnum="965"  time="014:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spnew19">
	<p pid="b.965.1/1">I completely concur with the hon. Gentleman. We must rationalise the regulations to make them simpler and easier to understand and to ensure that the responsibilities are clearly understood. We must co-ordinate action across the London boroughs in particular, but the whole of England&#8212;and beyond, I suspect&#8212;is affected by those activities. Whether that co-ordination is done through London Councils or the Mayor&#8217;s office, for example, should be determined outside this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.965.1/2">However, it is equally clear that one of the problems is the level of bureaucracy. The mayor of the London borough of Newham pointed out that a landlord has to fill out a form for each property when registering, which seems to make no sense for the landlords who operate a good service, compared with the rogue landlords, who ignore the rules anyway. We need to identify those landlords and the properties that are not properly registered and ensure that the rules, which should operate for everyone&#8217;s benefit, are implemented thoroughly and appropriately. I think that there is a potential for doing what the London borough of Brent did last year when it enforced the rules on a particular rogue landlord to ensure that all the others understand their responsibility and know that they will not get away with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.965.1/3">In my borough I have called on the council to operate a similar heat map so that we can identify, in the early hours of the morning, all the properties that do not have planning permission and are not registered as HMOs but appear to have people living in them. Anecdotally, I know that in many parts of my constituency homes have been built in gardens. Of course, they have</p>
	<p pid="b.965.1/4">been built as garden huts to shelter lawnmowers and other items of garden equipment, but uniquely they have kitchens, bathrooms, beds, windows, curtains, central heating and double glazing. That is clearly an affront to the planning rules. It means that the council is losing council tax income and that people are frequently being forced to live in substandard properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.965.1/5">It is clear that this is the tip of an iceberg. It needs Government action now. I welcome the fact that they have undertaken to fund a few local authorities that have a problem, but we need to encourage every authority that realises it has a problem to take enforcement action to end it and to bring the people causing it to justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.965.1/6">I conclude by wishing you, Madam Deputy Speaker, the staff and all hon. Members a merry Christmas and a happy, peaceful, prosperous and above all, particularly from my perspective, healthy new year. I trust that we will all have an enjoyable time over the recess.</p>

	<p pid="b.966.2/1">I am sorry&#8212;how could I?</p>
	<p pid="b.966.2/2">I hope to re-launch our housing campaign in Hayes and Harlington in the new year, and many of the themes the hon. Gentleman set out are echoed in many constituencies across London. Some of the solutions he set out&#8212;particularly the engagement of local authorities&#8212;are critically important. I welcome the Government&#8217;s additional money for Hillingdon, but it did not go far enough. A much more serious approach is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.2/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40650" name="Lyn Brown">the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> made a terrific speech, which needed to be made, although it was excruciating to hear about the pain that women have gone through. If she needs support in campaigning on any of the issues she raised, I am sure that she secured it across the House today.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.2/4">I wish to raise a number of issues as briefly as possible. It would be remiss of me not to mention the threat to my constituency from the proposed third and fourth runways at Heathrow. For many of my constituents, particularly in Harmondsworth and Longford, they will be sitting down this Christmas faced with the threat of their homes being bulldozed. We saw what happened with the original third runway proposal for Sipson, where a compensation scheme was introduced and BAA bought up virtually all the properties. People are living in those properties, but the life of the village&#8212;some have described it as a shell; I do not think it is that bad&#8212;is somewhat different from what it was. We are engaging the new residents in community life as best we can, but the blight caused by the threat of a runway being built over their homes has resulted in the loss of a large number of residents who had lived there for generations.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.2/5">The threat now extends across to Harmondsworth and Longford, and beyond into West Drayton, which was represented by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40621" name="John Randall">the right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir John Randall)</phrase> in former years. A population of 10,000 to 15,000 people now face an overall threat to their accommodation and from noise</p>
	<p pid="b.966.2/6">and pollution. Parents are sitting down at Christmas thinking that their home is going to be demolished some time in the future. They are planning their children&#8217;s education knowing that two of the best schools in our area&#8212;Heathrow and Harmondsworth primary schools&#8212;would be bulldozed as well. It looks as though other schools, particularly along the M4, perhaps Pinkwell and Harmondsworth primary schools, would be rendered unusable as a result of noise and air pollution.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.2/7">The right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip talked about Cherry Lane cemetery becoming an issue again. The last time we had this misfortune, the BAA documents that were leaked to us demonstrated that the road network that would service the new runway and the expanded airport ran through Cherry Lane cemetery. In particular, it ran through the children&#8217;s area of the cemetery, and that of course caused immense distress within my community. That threat will return with the road structure that would be proposed for the new third and fourth runways.</p>
	<p pid="b.966.2/8">I am also worried that Harmondsworth village will be obliterated, and that includes St Mary&#8217;s church and the mediaeval barn. Linked to St Mary&#8217;s church is the graveyard, which is still being used. Ironically, Keith Dobson, one of the prime campaigners with me over the past 40 years against a fourth terminal, a fifth terminal and a third runway, is buried in St Mary&#8217;s churchyard. It would be a tragedy if we had to disinter the bodies of our relatives and friends as a result of this.</p>

	<p pid="b.967.0/1">There are also a number of war graves in St Mary&#8217;s churchyard, and that is something else we have to consider.</p>

	<p pid="b.967.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman will remember that in our previous campaign, John Wilkinson, who was the Member for Ruislip-Northwood and served on the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, raised that very point. It was one of the key issues that was raised at the time of our very broad-based campaign against the expansion of Heathrow airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/2">I want Members to go away and think how devastating the announcement from the Davies commission is for these families. However, I am optimistic, as I think the right hon. Gentleman is, that we can defeat this. Any Government who sought to expand Heathrow airport, which would impact on perhaps 2 million people in terms of noise and air pollution, would face opprobrium. The political impact would be significant; I think it would determine a shift in a number of seats. On that basis, I cannot see any Government politically sustaining the policy of expanding Heathrow airport.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/3">Just in case anyone tries, let me give this warning: we will campaign on a scale that this Government and previous Governments have never seen before. It will be a campaign in which we mobilise local residents, but because of the impact across London, it will unite communities across London. There are already plans for a march all the way from Harmondsworth through every constituency affected&#8212;all the way through west London and into central London&#8212;which will garner support as we go along. It will be a crusade that will march right the way through west London and pick up hundreds, if not thousands of people in opposition to</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/4">the Government. There will also be support from green campaigners who are concerned about the impact of the expansion of Heathrow airport on climate change. There will be direct action campaigns by environmentalists.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/5">Last time this happened, a climate camp appeared in my constituency: 1,000 people turned up overnight, built a village and launched a direct action campaign, which contributed to influencing the Conservative party to change its policy. I warn the Government that people will not lie down and let their homes be bulldozed and their schools demolished, and they will not be threatened with having to dig up their dead from the cemetery. People will fight back, and as part of that fightback I will convene a meeting at Heathrow primary school on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-16">16 January</phrase>. I encourage Members to come along, because it will be the first discussion among local residents on the implications of the Davies announcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/6">On the HS2 link, which the right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has mentioned, ours is the only area in the whole country that does not yet know where HS2 will go. We have been denied the opportunity to engage in a consultation on the route, because the Government will not reveal the route into the airport. That has resulted in uncertainty in the community. It will be a blight on the area and, to be frank, the community is angry, because it no longer trusts politicians or Governments on any issue of infrastructure in our area. I do not mean this as a party political point, but for the Prime Minister to explicitly say,</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/7">&#8220;no ifs, no buts, there will be no third runway&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/8">only for us now to face not only a third, but a fourth runway, does not inspire confidence in the Government&#8217;s attitude to any infrastructure development in our area, including HS2.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/9">I urge all parties in the House to agree that the decisions on the options for runway and aviation expansion and for the HS2 route into Heathrow airport should not be delayed beyond the next election. The Davies commission was politically and strategically timed to report after the next general election, to get every political party off the hook. The electorate will not find that acceptable. They will see it as another politician&#8217;s ploy not to be honest with the people who will be affected by both schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/10">It behoves all political parties to come to an agreement that the final report of the Davies commission should be published before the general election, and individual political parties should go into that election explaining honestly to the electorate their position on aviation expansion. They also need to explain to my community their position on the link between HS2 and Heathrow. It will be seen as fundamentally dishonest of all the political parties if they do not state their case and demonstrate to the electorate their position on aviation expansion. If they do not make their position clear, people will see through them and they will get angry, and when people get angry with politicians and feel that the democratic and parliamentary process is not working for them, they will take to the streets. It will encourage even more direct action and more disillusionment with politics in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/11">I also want to address the Fire Brigades Union dispute, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> has mentioned. We face potential strikes by firefighters on Christmas eve, new</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/12">year&#8217;s eve and beyond. None of them want to take action and go on strike; they want a resolution. The dispute stems from the previous Government&#8217;s proposals to increase the retirement age of firefighters under the pension scheme. The Williams review submitted evidence to the Government of concerns about the physical capacity of firefighters undertaking duties beyond a certain age. That was ignored by the Government, and they went ahead.</p>
	<p pid="b.967.1/13">My hon. Friend mentioned the argument made with regard to other jobs, as did the hon. Member for Harrow West&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.969.1/1">I am so sorry. I have a directional problem: I am lost once I get north of the A40, I am afraid.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.1/2">It was proposed that those firefighters who were incapable of completing all of their duties could be moved to other roles, but then, unfortunately, the cuts took place and we identified that, in one year, there were only 15 vacancies to which front-line firefighters could be transferred in way that would enable them to continue in work and to pay into their pension and earn a wage. The reason for the disputes was that employers and the Government refused to recognise that there was an issue about the capability and fitness problem faced by firefighters. A strike took place, which at least led to a breakthrough in that employers recognised that there was an issue that had to be addressed. Negotiations took place on eight points, but they basically foundered on two main ones.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.1/3">The first, which was mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Limehouse, was the risk of having no job and no pension. Firefighters find that they physically cannot do the job, which all the evidence points towards. To be frank, I do not want a geriatric firefighter coming up a ladder to rescue me, and all the evidence demonstrates that as firefighters reach 55 or 60, their capability goes down. In addition, there is further evidence about the&#8212;short&#8212;longevity of firefighters after they retire.</p>

	<p pid="b.969.2/1">My hon. Friend referred to the Williams inquiry. Williams said that estimates were that from 20% up to 90% of firefighters would not be able to work until 60, so there is a big demand for alternative employment for them or for their pensions to be honoured.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.969.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="969"  time="015:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spnew28">
	<p pid="b.969.3/1">I thought that the FBU was fairly reasonable in simply asking for some guarantee to take back to its members about their having either a job or a pension. It is as simple as that: the problem is that people cannot be in the situation of having no job and no pension. As I have said, the employers and the Government accepted that there was an issue to address, but how were firefighters to gain such a guarantee? That is the problem of the dispute at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/2">In the negotiations, the fire Minister eventually offered a change to the national framework so that there is guidance to employers that some form of security should be given to firefighters in the form either of a job or of a guaranteed pension. The problem about the national framework is that it is guidance; it is not legally enforceable. The FBU has brought cases, so there is case law, and</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/3">Lord Justice Rix has clearly demonstrated that the framework is guidance that employers can ignore. It is as simple as that. One problem with Ministers coming and going, is that when Ministers give guidance, some employers perhaps abide by it for a period, but Ministers come and go and Governments come and go, and employers eventually interpret the guidance as they see fit.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/4">The FBU put forward a draft proposal that instead of guidance, the fire Minister should adopt regulations linked to the pension scheme. If he had accepted that, one of the main points of the dispute would have been resolved, but that was refused. The FBU has warned of further strike action. It has balloted its members and received overwhelming support for strike action. As a result of the legal process that unions have to go through, it has now had to call the dates for the strikes. The Minister wrote yesterday to say that he was willing to meet it again, but as I said in an intervention on my hon. Friend the Member for Poplar and Limehouse, the FBU is willing to meet any time, any place&#8212;wherever the Minister wants&#8212;but the talks have to be meaningful, not just another round of public relation stunts or spin.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/5">I have a lot of time for the fire Minister, but given the seriousness of the dispute, I would say at this point that the issue has reached Secretary of State level. As happened in the last fire dispute, the Secretary of State has to come to the table to start negotiations. In the last fire dispute under the previous Government, I remember the Prime Minister getting involved at one point to try to hammer out the issue so that people were not put at risk. We are within days of another dispute leading to another strike, and the Secretary of State needs at least to get involved in starting off negotiations. His coming to the table would demonstrate a seriousness of intent.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/6">The other issue, which I will not go into in depth, is that of contributions. That was mentioned by my hon. Friend, who gave the figures in percentage terms. Under the new pension scheme, there will be an increase in contributions each year for four years: for members of the 2006 scheme, contributions will go up from 8.5% in 2011 to 12.6% in 2015. A firefighter on a salary of &#163;29,766 will pay more than &#163;4,000 a year for their pension alone if those increases are imposed. That is a significant increase for people who are on a relatively modest wage for professionals in this field.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/7">I urge all Members, because the onus is on all of us, to ensure that we lay the path for negotiations to head off the current dispute. I think that the Secretary of State needs to come to the table for meaningful discussions to resolve the matter. I am happy to assist in the discussions at any time and to try to get people together. The FBU has made it very clear over the past 24 hours that it is willing to talk, but that the talks must be serious.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/8">Another staffing issue that I want to raise relates to staff in this House. The dispute of the Commons Tea Room staff has still not been resolved a year on. To make Members aware of what happened, let me say that elements of the new management decided to reinterpret the contract that some of the Members&#8217; Tea Room staff had been working on for more than 20 years. They decided that the old contract had been misinterpreted by the previous management and introduced what was effectively a reduction in pay and conditions. The dispute has gone on and negotiations have taken place, but it</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/9">has not been resolved. I am told that the next stage is that the individual members of staff are getting together as a group to meet management again.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/10">We are well served by those staff. They work incredibly hard, sometimes with demanding Members coming in at all hours and wanting all sorts of foodstuffs. They always serve us with a smile. I think that they deserve a bit more respect than they are getting. Trying to tear up their conditions of service when some of them have been working there for two decades is just not acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/11">Last week, I met the security staff here who are members of the Public and Commercial Services Union. I am chair of the PCS parliamentary group. New rosters were imposed on the security staff earlier this year. There was a strike, but it did not resolve the issue and the rosters were still imposed. The new rosters reduce the flexibility of the work and impact on carers. Those people are largely women, because they tend to be the carers in society, but it affects parents generally and other types of carers. The staff have demonstrated to management that the new rosters are costing more than the old ones because of the high levels of overtime that have to be paid and the lack of flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/12">The security staff are employed by the Metropolitan police on a contract. That contract is up for renegotiation in 2015. The staff are worried that they are being set up for privatisation. They want to enter into negotiations with management so that staff are able to continue with that contract or, if the Metropolitan police do not want the contract, the staff can be brought in-house. If Members have the time, they should speak to the security staff, because they are unhappy and disgruntled. They are worried not only about their terms of service, but that their service is not good enough because they do not have the flexibility that they used to have, that it is costing more and that their position will be undermined in the longer term.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/13">I want to make two last points. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40621" name="John Randall">The right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir John Randall)</phrase> spoke about the Metropolitan police. I am anxious about what is happening in the Met. A range of cuts are feeding through. Safer neighbourhood teams were one of the best policing reforms that were undertaken by the last Government. It is good to have a local sergeant, two police constables and a couple of police community support officers located within the ward and to have the guarantee that they will not be pulled out of the ward for other extraneous duties. The cuts that are coming through now are undermining safer neighbourhood policing in our areas. There are not sufficient PCs, the recruitment of PCSOs is not happening and safer neighbourhood teams are being combined. That is breaking down the local connection.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/14">The retirement of a large number of officers who had long service means that we have lost a lot of experienced police officers. When we lose that experience we also lose the supervision, and I am anxious about that. In my constituency, as in many across London, we are losing police officers and their visibility on the streets is being reduced. At the same time&#8212;I agree about this with the right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip and we share the same borough&#8212;the quality of</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/15">policing we receive is superb. The police work extremely hard under extremely difficult circumstances and with reducing resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/16">Finally, I will refer to one happy piece of news. The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain is a small trade union that has been running a campaign to secure the living wage for cleaners, particularly in central London and the City. One employer that has been a difficult nut to crack is a company called MITIE. The union organised its workers and there have been disputes and demonstrations. MITIE issued a letter to all its staff, basically saying that any appearance on a demonstration related to the living wage would be interpreted as gross misconduct and they would be dismissed. After a short campaign by the cleaners and an early-day motion in this House, and thanks to the hard work of the union organiser, Chris Ford, negotiations have taken place over the past couple of days. MITIE is now in negotiations with the union about the living wage in relation to the contract. It has withdrawn its threatening letter to the staff and even sent out a letter apologising to them. I congratulate the IWGB&#8212;in particular the organiser, Chris Ford&#8212;on that success, and also the employer for seeing sense and coming back to the negotiating table. I hope that will send a message to other employers.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/17">We all sort of glamorise John Lewis as a wonderful mutual&#8212;apart, that is, for the fact that it has outsourced its cleaners who are not part of the mutual system and not paid the London living wage. Again, the IWGB has been running a campaign on that, and I have been on the picket lines, trying to urge that company to recognise that its cleaners should be part of its mutual structure and paid properly. The other group of workers who I think will be mobilised over the coming period are fast-food workers. They are largely not unionised and many are on the minimum wage with poor employment conditions. We have convened a meeting in the House of Commons next year to bring together all those unions, and others who want to campaign for the rights of fast-food workers in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.969.3/18">In the spirit of Christmas, I wish hon. Members a happy Christmas and a determined and campaigning new year.</p>

	<p pid="b.972.0/1">It is good to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase>. He made a powerful case about ensuring proper consultation on HS2 and the new runways at Heathrow, and I understand his concerns. Perhaps the issue does not cause me quite so much concern when representing Tiverton and Honiton down in Devon, but I can see his concern and that of his constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.972.0/2">I want to raise a particularly difficult case that concerns the struggle of one of my constituents to obtain compensation for serious trauma caused to him back in the &#8216;80s. I will give a brief background to the case. My constituent was living on an Army base in Cyprus in the late &#8216;80s with his father, a GCHQ employee. My constituent experienced serious sexual abuse at the base from the age of 12 to 17 from a paedophile gang of military personnel from both the UK and the United Nations.</p>
	<p pid="b.972.0/3">My constituent is seeking compensation for the serious damage caused to him while living on that Army camp in Cyprus, but I understand that he is not eligible for</p>
	<p pid="b.972.0/4">compensation through the Criminal Injuries Compensation (Overseas) Scheme because his father was not military personnel, even though he was attached to the Cyprus base. There is a UK national Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme, but my constituent is excluded from that because the offences took place outside the United Kingdom. There is also a Europe-wide scheme, but again my constituent is excluded by reason of the offences taking place prior to the implementation of that scheme. My constituent is excluded from other possible avenues for compensation. He is at present without a remedy for the grievous harm he has suffered. I understand that GCHQ comes under the jurisdiction of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, so it might be thought reasonable for it to implement a matching scheme to provide compensation for those in my constituent&#8217;s position, or, alternatively, to offer a one-off compensation award under the same principles as the overseas scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.972.0/5">I have met Ministers and military police. I think and hope that in 2013 his case has been dealt with much more sympathetically and in a much better manner. The military police dealt with my constituent&#8217;s case in a very high-handed and ineffective way, and I want very much for him to have closure in this matter. We need to find some form of compensation, whatever it is, just to say that somebody has owned up to the fact that it was not dealt with properly, and that the abuse he sustained all those years ago still affects him now. I have met him several times. I do not know whether the Deputy Leader of the House can help in any way, but I seek help from him because this is a very serious matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.972.0/6">Moving on to other constituency matters, I would like to talk about the A30/A303. I hear in this House huge problems for the Government in trying to get HS2 going and the trouble with Heathrow airport. I assure the Government that they would have much less trouble dualling the A30/A303.</p>

	<p pid="b.973.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for the idea that we could have a runway for Heathrow, but I think we are about 180 miles away. That is a long way away, but I understand his sentiments.</p>
	<p pid="b.973.1/2">Returning to the A30/A303, from Exeter to Honiton the A30 is all dualled. It then goes from Honiton to the Somerset border, where it is not dualled. As it gets towards the Somerset border it splits off, with one part going on to Yeovil and the A30 carries on and goes into the A303. I want to see this part dualled in particular, and not just because it is in my constituency. Believe it or not, I am not just making a plea for my constituency, because it then travels up through Somerset and into Wiltshire. Of course, it passes by some rather interesting stones&#8212;I think they are called Stonehenge. How to pass them&#8212;whether we should build a tunnel and so on&#8212;has always been a thorny problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.973.1/3">I think that, in all, nine sections of the A30/A303 need to be dualled. As a Government, we need to start picking up and running with these individual schemes. The greater the amount of dual carriageway on the road, the more we will have a second arterial route into the west country. Devon and Cornwall in particular, and Somerset too, rely a lot on tourism. Our businesses</p>
	<p pid="b.973.1/4">are hugely affected by the speed of travel. If the M5 is blocked, there is just carnage because traffic cannot get through.</p>

	<p pid="b.974.0/1">I was not expecting to intervene, but as my mother-in-law lives along the A303&#8212;not that I necessarily want to rush to get to my mother-in-law&#8217;s&#8212;I know the road has congestion points that create huge tailbacks, particularly leading back from Stonehenge towards London. I sympathise with my hon. Friend, and I am, of course, very much looking forward to seeing my mother-in-law on Boxing day.</p>

	<p pid="b.974.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his comment. On this occasion, it being Christmas, I am sure he will be delighted to see his mother-in-law. To be serious, he is absolutely right. Travelling the A30 down into Cornwall, one finds large tailbacks on every long stretch of non-dualled road, but on short non-dualled roads, there is always much less of a tailback. I hope we will get a dual carriageway, tunnel or something past Stonehenge, but if not, at least a lot more dualling on the road would speed up the process. The other day, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury announced a pipeline of funding, so I asked him to turn on the tap. I am looking forward to the tap being turned on and that road being built.</p>
	<p pid="b.974.1/2">On a third constituency matter, Feniton is a village on the outskirts of Honiton that was flooded many times last year and which has been under threat this year, yet several planning applications have been made for 200 homes in the village. These proposed homes have been refused by the district and parish councils, and the local population oppose them hugely because the infrastructure is not there. These homes will create more surface run-off and cause more flooding. I want the Planning Inspectorate to consider that point. I understand that the planning Minister is issuing guidance to planning inspectors to ensure that the infrastructure of a village or town is taken into consideration when appeal decisions are being looked at. It is imperative that this matter be treated in that way, because Feniton could be swamped by these homes and the infrastructure&#8212;the roads, the sewerage system and the schools&#8212;would be overloaded.</p>
	<p pid="b.974.1/3">On a general point about flooding throughout my constituency, we are on an alert even as we speak. We must learn the lessons of flooding. No, we cannot stop it raining, and no we cannot stop flooding, but we can ensure that our rivers and tributaries are dredged and enable more local management of waterways so that the people who know exactly when the rivers are too high, when sluices need to be opened and when drainage points are blocked can do that work. The result would be a lot less flooding. It is good that the Government are negotiating Flood Re with the insurance companies. That means that my constituents should be able to get insurance at a reasonable cost. I also want to emphasise the fact that sometimes the Environment Agency&#8217;s flood-prevention schemes can be very expensive, but local people could help bring that about and do a lot of self-help.</p>
	<p pid="b.974.1/4">On a final issue, we are about to agree yet another reform of the common agricultural policy. Under the new settlement, money will be taken for so-called capping or modulation, although we do not know whether it</p>
	<p pid="b.974.1/5">will be 9%, 12% or 15%; we are waiting for the Government to say exactly how much. I make this plea: we must make good use of the money we take from farmers and put in place good environmental schemes that will help not only agriculture, but the environment, grasslands and hills, such as those in Devon.</p>

	<p pid="b.975.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for allowing me another bite at the cherry.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.0/2">Last Friday, I met my local farmers, and they raised with me a good question about the modulation that my hon. Friend could put to the Secretary of State or Ministers. According to many farmers, 15% is an extraordinarily high figure, and some justification for why it is not 9% or 9.5%, as in other EU countries, would be useful.</p>

	<p pid="b.975.1/1">I had better be quick because, Madam Deputy Speaker, you are looking me very sternly.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.1/2">Yes, 15% is very high. We must use this modulated money to put in place environmental schemes that are necessary. We must not take money from farmers unless we know exactly what we are going to do with it. In the end, the family farms in Devon and across the country are important, not only to farming, but to the countryside itself.</p>

	<p pid="b.975.2/1">I am pleased to be able to contribute to this debate. Sadly, I start with a complaint. Although I welcome the opportunity of a Christmas Adjournment debate and the fact that a Member can raise any issue they want, the system that we have had in other times when there have been themed debates with a Minister replying is a far more satisfactory way of dealing with parliamentary business. I do not doubt that the Deputy Leader of the House will report in great detail to each Minister concerned and ensure that we get an answer, but the whole point of the House of Commons is to hold the Government and Ministers to account rather than using it as a sounding-board Chamber where anyone can raise anything they like and it then disappears into the ether.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/2">I strongly compliment the staff here&#8212;as I am sure does everyone else&#8212;for their work, loyalty, and sympathy to both Members and the public. They often do a difficult job, and I admire them enormously and want to put on record my thanks to them. As a Parliament, we should value them a lot more. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> said, the treatment of the staff in the Tea Room, their change of contracts and deteriorating working conditions are simply not good enough. We should be much better employers and we should value the service and the loyalty that those staff give us. We need to remember that we should provide a good example of employment practices and not work on the basis of gross exploitation of people. Indeed, we should not be losing our very good and experienced staff. We should reflect on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/3">None the less, in the same spirit as everyone else, I wish all the staff here a good Christmas and new year and thank them for the work that they do.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/4">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" name="Bob Blackman">the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase>, whom I compliment on his contribution, I want to raise the issue of housing in London. I represent an inner-city constituency, which has somewhat different characteristics from those of Harrow. Nevertheless housing is a huge issue. Roughly speaking, my borough divides 40:30:30&#8212;council and housing association houses and social rented accommodation make up about 40% of the borough&#8217;s housing; private rented houses about 30% and owner-occupied houses 30%. The owner-occupation rate is well below the national average, and falling very fast. The private rented sector is well above the national average and rising very fast. The social ownership section is increasing a bit through the work of the housing associations and the council&#8217;s commendable building programme to try to provide homes for people who desperately need them.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/5">The problem we have is an enormous housing list of people in often desperate housing need. The chances of them being housed in a council-owned house or a housing association place are very limited, so the council fulfils its obligations to them in the only way it can, which is by placing them in the private rented sector. Many of those private flats are not in the borough; they are some distance away. That in itself creates a problem. The applicants accept the accommodation because they have no choice. They aspire to return to the borough, so the large numbers of families who are placed outside the borough make very long journeys to ensure that their children maintain a place at the same school, which is important from the point of view of the continuity of education for primary school-aged children.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/6">The other issue is that the benefit level cap on housing expenditure, the housing allowance, is way below the average rent in the private sector. The transitional money the Government approved on the introduction of the cap is drying up and disappearing. Frankly, what we are going through is nothing more than a process of social cleansing from inner London, as families on benefit&#8212;sometimes in work, and sometimes not in work, as it affects people almost equally&#8212;can no longer remain in the borough and must therefore be accommodated elsewhere. That exacerbates the whole problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/7">We have a high degree of housing stress among those families. I meet families all the time and I am very worried about the impact of such a degree of housing insecurity on a whole generation of children as they grow up. Members of this House all earn a good salary, have reasonable accommodation to live in and do not feel a sense of housing insecurity. We should try and put ourselves in the mindset of young parents trying to bring up children in the private rented sector knowing that they have no security of tenure and could lose their flat within six months. If they complain, they are likely to find that their tenancy is terminated. The effect on the parents is extreme stress, but the effect on the children is great uncertainty about their place in life and the ability of their parents to provide for them. We are damaging a whole generation of people through the housing policies that are being adopted in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/8">I am not making a partisan point, because my party, when in government, certainly did not do enough to build the necessary new housing. It certainly did not do</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/9">enough to bring in much tougher regulation of the private rented sector any more than this Government have. I applaud what my council is trying to do by developing new council properties of a good and high standard and what it has achieved through the decent homes standard. The estates are in a much better condition than they ever used to be. Nevertheless, we live in an area where property prices are rising fast. I think I am right to say that more than 80% of the borough does not earn enough money to be able to buy a property within Islington, so the only option for those people is the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/10">There are areas in which the sector must be reformed, and quickly. I have with me a copy of the report by the Communities and Local Government Committee on the regulation of the private rented sector, which is an interesting, well-written document that calls for the simplification of the regulation of the private rented sector and better education of both landlords and tenants. I agree with all that. Sometimes, the report&#8217;s proposals are a bit too timid but I agree with the general thrust of what it is trying to say.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/11">We must be a little bolder. I introduced a ten-minute rule Bill on the subject, and I want to see fundamental change in three areas of the private rented sector. The first is the role of the letting agents. At the moment, there is almost no regulation of letting agents. Anyone can set up a letting agency, there are no checks on them whatsoever and anybody can claim to be a letting agent and start renting out properties. I think they should all be regulated so we know who is working where, so that they have to provide proper information to all prospective tenants, and so that they are not allowed to introduce arbitrary and often totally unfair charges such as search fees, which are always non-returnable and often expensive. There should also be much clearer explanation for prospective tenants of what they are getting into.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/12">Agents are also often deeply discriminatory. A sign in a window that reads, &#8220;No DSS&#8221; shows first of all that they are deeply out of date with the structure of the social security system in this country&#8212;it is now the Department of Work and Pensions and it is a housing allowance, not DSS as it was about 20 years ago&#8212;and also fundamentally discriminates against somebody who is perfectly legally claiming what they are entitled to from the DWP. Why should they not be allowed to rent because they are claiming? The investigation by &#8220;Panorama&#8221; showed the race discrimination and racial profiling by the agencies, which are a scar on our society that deeply disfigures people&#8217;s lives and life chances. Discrimination is wrong in any aspect, whether it be financial in respect of benefit claimants or racial discrimination as operated by some agents. We must have proper regulation of these agencies.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/13">A number of London boroughs are actively considering setting up their own letting agency to manage the number of people they place within in the private rented sector and offering the service to landlords and tenants alike. I think that would be a wholly good thing&#8212;it would be properly run, properly managed and probably a lot cheaper for everyone concerned than the present system.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/14">The second area relates to points raised by the hon. Member for Harrow East about the condition and maintenance of private sector properties. Yesterday, I</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/15">met an interesting gentleman from the Electrical Safety Council, who told me his concerns&#8212;they were held by the fire service and many others, too&#8212;about the lack of regular electrical checks in the private rented sector. It can often be an extremely dangerous place to be. There are supposed to be gas checks and all kinds of checks, but they are often never carried out.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/16">I have had experience of tenants in the private rented sector making wholly legitimate complaints about the condition of their flat&#8212;the lack of insulation, the poor quality windows, the high energy bills they incur because of all that and infestation by vermin. They usually find that nothing is done about that, and if they contact the environmental health service, they might find their tenancy terminated at the first possible opportunity by the landlord. It is scandalous that if tenants try to exercise their rights, they lose their property. Although that might mean that environmental health can enforce better conditions for the next tenant, it is not much help for the tenant who has been evicted for having the temerity to try to exercise their rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/17">The third area is probably the most controversial&#8212;the question of the rent levels charged. If I look across the whole country, I realise that the rent levels charged in the private rented sector vary enormously, often over quite short distances. The rent levels in central London are massive; if we move a short distance towards the outer London boroughs, the rent levels are a bit less; if we move a bit further out of London, they become much less; if we move to other regions in the country, the rent levels might not be the main problem, but there could be other areas of regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/18">My private Member&#8217;s Bill&#8212;I have no notion of whether it will ever become law; certainly not in this Parliament, although I hope the idea will become law at some point&#8212;is not only about empowering local authorities to set up letting offices and agencies, but about requiring simplified advice to be given to landlords and tenants about how the properties will be operated. Authorities will also have the power to impose a level of regulation on the rent levels charged in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/19">In that respect, a number of formulae could be adopted. One would be simply to take a figure and declare it to be a reasonable rent for the area. Rent levels could be based on the capital value of the property and the cost of maintaining its value if money has been borrowed to purchase it. Alternatively, because the structure of the private rented sector is changing fast, we could require large private sector landlords&#8212;there are some of them around nowadays&#8212;to provide at least 50% of their properties for rent at an affordable level, as we would require for any new large housing development.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/20">If we do not regulate the private rented sector, we are condemning, in the case of my borough, a third of the population to a life of insecurity&#8212;and the numbers of private rented properties are likely to rise considerably over the next few years. All the predictions are that while it is around 17% nationally now, it will probably be 25%, if not more, by the end of this decade. Other countries manage to have a pretty fully regulated private rented sector. The hon. Member for Harrow East referred to the Select Committee visit to Germany, which has a very regulated private rented sector&#8212;often, interestingly, with much larger landlords, who often manage the properties a lot better.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/21">One of the problems in my constituency is that it contains a large number of very small landlords who only ever think of the headline return in the form of the rent. They never think of the cost of maintenance, the cost of repairs, or the cost of simply managing a property. We need to devise a much better system. The Select Committee report was a good start, but the Government&#8217;s response was more than disappointing. No doubt we shall return to the issue in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/22">Let me end with this thought. We all want to enjoy a nice Christmas&#8212;who doesn&#8217;t?&#8212;but we also want to enjoy a degree of security in our lives, and I think that we should consider for a moment the very large number of people who live in the private rented sector. Not all landlords are bad; some are good, decent, generous people who look after their tenants in the way in which we would all want to be looked after ourselves; but, unfortunately, not all of them are like that. There are some terrible rogue landlords, and some terrible practices. We used to say awful things about Rachman and what he did in winkling secure tenants out of north Kensington all those decades ago, but there are very few secure tenancies now. Landlords no longer need to winkle people out. They can end assured shorthold tenancies after six months, move another tenant in, and charge the new tenant a higher rent&#8212;and so the whole situation continues.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/23">If we are to maintain the social and cultural diversity of London, and indeed other cities, we must maintain the diversity of housing, and of housing options and opportunities. Like all Members, I visit hospitals, Royal Mail sorting offices, police stations and fire stations. I always ask people where they live, and I find that fewer and fewer of them can afford to live in central London. They are commuting for longer and longer distances, at greater and greater cost to themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.975.2/24">We must address the housing issue. Yes, we can do that by building more houses and providing greater security and better conditions, but what is crucially and urgently needed is proper regulation of the private rented sector, so that we can provide the sense of security that we would all want for ourselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.979.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. At the beginning of my speech, I inadvertently failed to draw Members&#8217; attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests. May I correct that through your good offices, and apologise to the House?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.979.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40170" speakername="Lindsay Hoyle" speakeroffice="Mr Deputy Speaker"  colnum="979"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spnew38">
	<p pid="b.979.1/1">I think that the clarification is already on the record.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.979.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40111" speakername="Brooks Newmark" colnum="979"  time="016:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spnew39">
	<p pid="b.979.2/1">I want to begin, rather than end, my speech by wishing all the staff of the House, and the police, a happy Christmas. They serve all of us here in Parliament extremely well, and I hope that they will have a relaxing Christmas holiday and a happy new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/2">I also want to thank certain groups in my constituency which I know will be working very hard over Christmas. The Salvation Army does a tremendous job in looking</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/3">after the homeless, not just in Braintree but, I believe, in all our constituencies, and Braintree Foyer looks after young people so well when they have nowhere to go. Then there are the church groups, which serve our food banks incredibly well. As we know from our recent debate on the subject, the use of food banks has increased&#8212;there is no denying that&#8212;and many of the church groups in our communities are playing a leading role in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/4">Let me now issue a plea to everyone in my constituency, and to all who are listening here. Many elderly people will be alone this Christmas, and if someone can spend just one or two hours with an elderly person, it will make a very big difference to that person at this very important time of the year.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/5">I promised that I would be brief, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I will be, but I want to raise one constituency issue. I want to talk about two aspects of infrastructure, the first being trains. Unfortunately, we in Braintree are not well served by trains. There is a main line to Witham and then onwards, and there is a branch line from Witham to Braintree. As a branch line, we only get one train an hour. That causes enormous problems, and ever since I became a candidate in 1999&#8212;long before I was an MP&#8212;I was calling for a loop to be put in between Braintree and Witham because that will allow more people to travel along that line rather than waiting the one hour, as they have to, or getting in their cars.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/6">The big problem is that Braintree has grown enormously even in the past 15 years that I have lived in the area. As a result, when people get on the train at Braintree they find that it is already at capacity, so by the time it reaches Cressing or White Notley, let us say, on the way to Witham it is often totally full. That creates huge problems, and one way to alleviate that pressure is to build a loop between Braintree and Witham.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/7">I ask Greater Anglia and Abellio, who are the controllers of the train line, to think about these three Cs: capacity, cancellations and communication. With capacity, the issue is that the trains are often full at peak times, as I have mentioned, so it would be very useful for them to think about investing in that loop which I and others have been asking for. That will take people off the roads and on to the trains, and as they will be using the train services more, it will make the loop more economically viable.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/8">The second C is cancellations. In the past month or so there have been three cancellations of the 6.45 am train. If someone is planning to catch a train at Cressing and they have a meeting in London that morning, and the 6.45 am train is cancelled and they do not know about it in advance, they have a big problem. The bigger problem is that, unfortunately, Greater Anglia has not put on any other services, such as a bus service, to take them to Witham, and it might not even inform passengers that there is a problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/9">That brings me to my third C: communication. It is very important that Greater Anglia communicates with passengers, explaining that there is a problem, rather than passengers simply standing on the platform and seeing the train whizz past them. That can be extremely frustrating if they have a morning meeting in London or elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/10">I therefore ask Abellio and Greater Anglia to think about those three issues of capacity, dealing with</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/11">cancellations with care and efficiency, and communicating with passengers. That is extremely important. They should think seriously about building a loop between Braintree and Cressing, because I think that will deal with a lot of the problems they face. I know from having talked to Braintree district council and Essex county council that they would be willing to put in some money to try to get this loop between Braintree and Cressing, as would local businesses. So again I make my plea to Abellio and Greater Anglia to think about building this loop, and perhaps the Secretary of State for Transport&#8212;the ex-Chief Whip and my ex-boss&#8212;will also consider that plea of mine.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/12">My second infrastructure point is to do with the A120, and it relates very much to something my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40608" name="Neil Parish">the Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)</phrase> was saying. Drivers come up the M11, let us say, and then get on to the A120 at Stansted and have a beautiful two and three-lane highway all the way to Braintree, but when they get to Braintree they hit Galleys corner, which is known as cholesterol corner for two reasons: first, because of the KFC, the McDonald&#8217;s and the other fast food outlets that are located there, and secondly, because a major traffic blockage forms there.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/13">While I appreciate that when the new Secretary of State took up his post he generously gave us a little over &#163;300,000 to deal with the little pinch-point at Galleys corner, unfortunately that only dealt with a tiny piece of the problem. What we really need to do is dual the road the eight or nine miles between Braintree and Marks Tey in order to alleviate the blockage. I want Members to imagine a fast road that goes all the way from London through to Stansted and then on to Braintree, and then suddenly it stops. For eight or nine miles, there is a single-lane carriageway, the A12, to Marks Tey, at which point the road becomes the A120, and a dual carriageway, again, and continues all the way to Harwich.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/14">Alleviating the pinch-points along this transnational, perhaps trans-European, network is important. Many groups in Braintree have campaigned for this to happen, including the Braintree business council, the Braintree business forum, Councillor Siddall, who is in charge of businesses on Braintree district council, and my friend Malcolm Hobbs. They have all have campaigned for the dualling of the road.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/15">I do not deny that this would be an expensive project. It could cost up to &#163;300 million, which is an enormous amount. However, time is money, and if people are stuck in their cars, that can be expensive for them. There are local groups in Braintree that are willing to invest in the project, and we could form a public-private partnership to achieve this. Essex county council, Braintree district council and various local businesses have all said that they would put in some money to alleviate the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/16">I make a direct plea to the Secretary of State for Transport and even to the Chancellor himself, who has been extremely generous in giving money to other infrastructure projects around the country, to alleviate this minor road block by putting some money into this project. It would create jobs locally and alleviate pressure and blight in several areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/17">I shall leave the House with those two thoughts: a rail loop between Braintree and Witham, and the dualling of the road between Braintree and Marks Tey. Achieving those two goals would make me very happy and, more</p>
	<p pid="b.979.2/18">importantly, it would make my constituents who are trying to use the roads and public transport very happy. I shall also take this opportunity to wish everyone, including you, Mr Deputy Speaker, a happy Christmas and new year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.982.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40152" speakername="Tom Brake" speakeroffice="The Deputy Leader of the House of Commons"  colnum="982"  time="016:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.982.0/1">There is quite a lot to respond to, and I hope to be able to touch on most of the points that have been raised. I shall certainly respond to those Members who are still in their place. I was perhaps hoping that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">the Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase> would not reappear, because the duration of my speech would have been halved if I had not needed to respond to all the points that he raised. He has returned to his place, however, so I shall respond to him for starters.</p>
	<p pid="b.982.0/2">My hon. Friend raised concerns about certain House matters, including Tuesday sittings, Prime Minister&#8217;s questions and the fact that the Press Gallery was always empty. Those are things that the House can discuss, and Members will be able to tell us whether they are happy with the Tuesday sittings and whether they are content to keep Prime Minister&#8217;s questions as a half-hour slot on a Wednesday, rather than reverting to the two 15-minute slots on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>
	<p pid="b.982.0/3">My hon. Friend also expressed concern that there were too many quangos, but I hope he welcomes the fact that the coalition Government have got rid of a substantial number of them. He asked about the Chilcot inquiry. If he is familiar with its website, he will be able to look at the latest exchange of correspondence on that matter and to see where we are at. Obviously, we want the inquiry to publish its findings, and we should not try to pre-empt their content.</p>
	<p pid="b.982.0/4">My hon. Friend also expressed concern about some aspects of freedom of information. He then went on to talk about air pollution, describing it as a hidden killer. I agree with him on that. The fact that people do not visibly drop dead from air pollution means that it is not treated with the same seriousness as heart attacks and strokes. He was right to say that its principal source, apart from industry, is the tailpipes of the cars and other vehicles that we all drive around in. The Government take the issue seriously and we are working towards the legally binding pollution limits set out in European Union legislation. My hon. Friend also rightly highlighted the importance of alternative fuels, such as liquefied petroleum gas, and the fact that they can make a big difference to air quality. He went on to touch on the issue of fire safety.</p>

	<p pid="b.982.2/1">I will give way when I have finished this point. Again, I agree with my hon. Friend that it is important that we all learn lessons from fire incidents and that best practice is spread effectively. On that point, I give way to someone who knows an awful lot about these matters.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.982.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" speakername="Jim Fitzpatrick" colnum="982"  time="016:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spnew42">
	<p pid="b.982.3/1">I was going to pick up the point on pollution. European regulations require air quality to be up to a certain mark, but London is failing on so many counts that we have a five-year derogation. If</p>
	<p pid="b.982.3/2">fines are levelled against the UK, will they have to be paid for by the UK Government or the Mayor of London?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-12-19b.983.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40152" speakername="Tom Brake" colnum="983"  time="016:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131219/debtext/131219-0003.htm#131219-0003.htm_spnew43">
	<p pid="b.983.0/1">I wish I had not given way, because I do not know the answer to that question. However, I am sure that we can secure a written response for the hon. Gentleman, who has highlighted the fact that we have significant air quality issues to address in London. The Mayor does need to tackle them firmly. I know that he has launched certain initiatives, but the impact of vehicles is significant and we need to examine wider measures to try to tackle the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/2">My hon. Friend then discussed the Disclosure and Barring Service, which was previously the Criminal Records Bureau. I suspect that many hon. Members will have encountered issues with the CRB and the DBS relating to turnaround times. Often it is not clear where the delays are occurring, because sometimes they are in securing a response from the police. He touched on the issue of school governors, and I think we can all agree that they play an essential role and make a substantial contribution. I suspect that many hon. Members will have been, or may still be, a school governor. As he stated, they need specific skills, and he identified finance as an area where we perhaps need more people coming in. I encourage them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/3">My hon. Friend touched on the issue of blue badges. He, like me, and I am sure other hon. Members, has experienced some issues relating to the changes that have taken place with that service. I am sure he represents very effectively his constituents who are experiencing difficulties because they were in receipt of a badge but now are finding that it is not available to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/4">My hon. Friend mentioned hepatitis. The Department of Health recognises the public health importance of tackling viral hepatitis in England; it imposes a significant burden on the NHS, so he was right to highlight the importance of tackling it. He referred to the South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust, which provides mental health services, expressing some concerns about that. Clearly I am not going to refer to any individual cases, but I hope that one thing he would take as a positive step forward is the fact that the Government and the Minister who leads on these issues have been strong in pushing for parity of esteem; in other words, people with mental health issues should treated in exactly the same way as we would expect people who need to go through the acute health service to be treated. They should get identical quality of care and should see pathways that operate just as effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/5">My hon. Friend also touched on the exotic pet trade, which is a serious contributory factor to the threat of extinction faced by many endangered species. The UK Border Force is responsible for dealing with that, and we need to ensure that anyone dealing in that particular trade follows the rules and completes the right paperwork to ensure that everything is above board.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/6">My hon. Friend mentioned Ray Woodcock, a great granddad who has just broken a Guinness world record, jumping 384 feet down into a flooded quarry. I will make sure that the Chief Whips hear of that, because it may have other potential uses for MPs who misspeak in this place.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/7">Finally, my hon. Friend talked about Southend&#8217;s city of culture. It brought a smile to my face when he identified Southend as the alternative city of culture. That is something we can all smile about and welcome. I am sure we will follow developments carefully. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Southend West for opening the debate. That leaves me a little bit of time to respond to the other contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/8">The first point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40484" name="Jim Fitzpatrick">the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)</phrase> raised was about Afsana, a constituent of his who is stranded in Dubai. I am pleased that the hon. Gentleman has had the support that he needed from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the consular staff, although I understand perfectly why the family will feel that that is not sufficient, given the very serious predicament that their family member is in. I am pleased to hear that a meeting with the Minister has already been agreed, and I am sure the hon. Gentleman will pursue the matter as assiduously in that meeting as he has done previously. I am sure that the FCO and consular staff will do everything in their power to help resolve the problem, although all of us who have had experiences of constituents abroad dealing with other legal systems know that that is one of the biggest challenges any Member of Parliament can face in taking up issues on behalf of constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/9">The hon. Gentleman touched on the issue of firefighters&#8217; pensions. He obviously has extensive knowledge of that, which he brings in a very positive way to the Chamber this afternoon. He highlighted some aspects and recognised that it is a good scheme for firefighters. He will know, and I know as a result of a chance meeting with a firefighter while I was out canvassing at the weekend, that the contribution that firefighters make to their pensions is quite significant. The figure that I was quoted was &#163;900 a month as a pension contribution. I am aware that the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40286" name="Brandon Lewis">the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis)</phrase>, has stated his willingness to engage with the Fire Brigades Union, and I hope that will be pursued, as it is not in the interest of the FBU, the Government or the wider public for strike action to go ahead. If there is a possibility of the talks finding a resolution, let us pursue that option.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/10">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40621" name="John Randall">the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir John Randall)</phrase> is in his place. I wish him every success in seeking out that plum role in panto. That was everyone&#8217;s cue for &#8220;Oh no, you don&#8217;t&#8221;, but they were too slow. My right hon. Friend referred to HS2 and the third runway. It is clear that, particularly in relation to HS2, there will be many opportunities to discuss that further in the months and years to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/11">My right hon. Friend dwelt at some length on his interests. From the trip that we both undertook to Venezuela and Brazil some year ago, I know about his interest in environmental matters, wildlife and especially bird life. I recommend that he does not walk around Clapham common in the dark with his bat detection material. He may want to choose another location. He spoke about the Democratic Republic of the Congo and concerns there about its wildlife park. I agree that that is a significant issue, but the DRC has a much wider range of issues that we need to contribute towards resolving, as well as that concern. My right hon. Friend raised the issue of upland habitats here. He may have</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/12">the opportunity at DEFRA questions on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-09">9 January</phrase> to raise that and other environment-related matters that he referred to.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/13">There are a couple of issues that I will draw to the attention of the Ministry of Justice&#8212;vicarious liability and the changes to legal aid, which my right hon. Friend flagged up. He finished by thanking both the Metropolitan police and the staff of the House, and I join him in that. We all know as Members of Parliament that unfortunately the activities of a very small number of people tend to rub off on the activities of others who have no involvement in inappropriate activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40255" name="Eric Joyce">The hon. Member for Falkirk (Eric Joyce)</phrase> raised the serious issue of eating disorders. It is something the Government take very seriously, particularly among young people. We know that those most affected are young people between the ages of 14 and 25, and there might be as many as 1.1 million people&#8212;a substantial number&#8212;in the UK directly affected. Since April the relevant services have been commissioned by NHS England, so Members who represent English constituencies should raise concerns on the matter with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/15"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40573" name="Jeremy Lefroy">The hon. Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, raised a large number of issues. He wanted us to remember 3 Mercian, which we will do. He referred to the role of the trust special administrator at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust. I think that he was pleased with some of the outcomes of the process but had concerns about others. I echo those concerns in relation to my local hospital, St Helier. It is a category 6 hospital, so one of the safest in the country, and the best in England, Wales and Northern Ireland for dealing with hip fractures, yet it is proposed, as a result of a clinician review, that its A and E and maternity departments should close, which I will fight very hard.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/16">The hon. Gentleman raised a number of other health-related issues, which he might want to raise in health questions on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-14">14 January</phrase>. He also touched on HS2. Given that today we had Transport questions, in which HS2 featured prominently, followed by a statement from the Chair of the Transport Committee, I do not think that there is anything further that I could add. Finally, I was pleased to hear him speaking up for the Government&#8217;s position on international development. Following the actions of the previous Government, we are ensuring that we deliver 0.7% of GNI for international development. That gives us credibility around the world when we are talking about the subject. We are recognised internationally for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/17">Like other Members, I winced and shuffled in my seat when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40650" name="Lyn Brown">the hon. Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown)</phrase> described the painful process of hysteroscopy. I hope that she, on behalf of us all, will thank her constituent and the other women for providing that information. I think that we need a considered response from the Department of Health. Perhaps more guidance could be issued, whether for patients or doctors, because clearly she has identified a pattern with that procedure and I think that it needs a detailed response.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/18"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" name="Bob Blackman">The hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase> talked about beds in sheds. Members will know that the Prime Minister has visited Southall to look at that issue. We heard other contributions this afternoon on the private rented sector. It was clear from the cross-party consensus that emerged that something needs to be done. I am sure that the Backbench Business Committee</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/19">would respond positively to a cross-party request to discuss those issues, because clearly it is unacceptable that people are living in sheds. It was noted that in Slough there were just over 6,100 houses where people were potentially living in sheds, although I suspect that some of them were cannabis farms, because of the heat generated. He also highlighted the number of fires that had happened over a three-year period&#8212;just under 350, with nine associated deaths. This not only has a very negative impact on the people who are having to live in those conditions; sometimes the consequences are significantly more serious.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/20">I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman has yet responded to the housing Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40338" name="Kris Hopkins">the hon. Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins)</phrase>, who has written to him to say that he would be happy to meet him to discuss his concerns. He set out in his speech some possible solutions that I am sure the Minister would want to hear. Other Members made some important points that I am sure the Department for Communities and Local Government would appreciate hearing about.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/21"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">The hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> raised the issue of the third runway. He has been an articulate and consistent advocate against that runway on behalf of his local community, under the coalition Government and under the previous Government. He also discussed HS2, the Fire Brigades Union dispute, and staffing in the House of Commons. He then talked about safer neighbourhood teams. As a London Member of Parliament, I think that unfortunately the changes that have happened mean that there is less visibility on the streets, and people are raising that in terms of the profile of the police. That is an area that we need to monitor. On the living wage, he highlighted the more positive developments in relation to MITIE and flagged up the actions that John Lewis might like to take in this respect. The Government are very supportive of employers who want to take that route, although one could take the view that some employers might find it difficult to provide the living wage.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/22"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40608" name="Neil Parish">The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish)</phrase> referred to a very difficult case of abuse involving UK and UN personnel that occurred many years ago and did not comply with or satisfy any of the compensation schemes that were available. I can understand why his constituent and he would want closure on the issue. I will certainly draw it to the attention of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence in terms of possible solutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/23">The hon. Gentleman mentioned an infrastructure proposal regarding the A30 and the A303 and a bid for dualling, although he did not offer it up as an extremely long runway for Heathrow. He then talked about the village of Feniton and his concerns about flooding and the impact of housing development. There may be an opportunity for him to raise those issues as soon as we get back, because the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will respond to questions on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-09">9 January</phrase> and the Department for Communities and Local Government will respond to questions on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-13">13 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/24"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">The hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> complained that we were not having a themed debate today. He may or may not be aware that the Backbench Business Committee discussed the matter and felt that today&#8217;s debate should be in this format. Perhaps next</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/25">time it will feel that it should be in the previous format, with themes. Perhaps housing could have been a theme for today&#8217;s debate, or fire brigade disputes&#8212;who knows what would have been appropriate? We have a Member here who will feed back the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s concerns, and we will see what decision the Committee makes for future pre-recess Adjournment debates.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/26">I echo the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s praise for the contribution that the staff in this place make to the way in which we work. He then dwelled on housing in London, picking up the points raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East. He described the particular challenges faced in a borough like Islington&#8212;which I know about reasonably well having lived there some years ago&#8212;as regards the cost of housing and the need to build more affordable homes. I am not sure whether the Government would want to follow the hon. Member for Islington North down the route of regulating letting agencies, but he has identified an issue with private landlords that requires a solution. I will make sure that the proposal in his private Member&#8217;s Bill is drawn to the attention of the Department for Communities and Local Government to see whether it can provide a solution. Given that we have had substantial contributions on the issue of housing and the private rented sector in particular, the Backbench Business Committee may look favourably on a request for a debate early in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/27">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40111" name="Brooks Newmark">the Member for Braintree (Mr Newmark)</phrase>, who has just left his place, thanked organisations in his constituency, including the Salvation Army and church groups. I am sure we would all want to echo those remarks. I will visit my local Salvation Army tomorrow to pick up some gifts for me to give to a family who cannot afford presents this Christmas. The Salvation Army is making a positive contribution at this festive time of year, as are church groups by organising lunches for people who might otherwise be alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/28">My hon. Friend also referred to a couple of transport infrastructure projects and I will make sure that the Department for Transport is made aware of those two bids. I do not intend to visit cholesterol corner&#8212;it does not sound like a nice place to go&#8212;where people can get their arteries blocked in more ways than one: from KFC and McDonald&#8217;s to the traffic congestion at the junction.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/29">I believe that I have touched on most or even all of the points that have been raised. In conclusion, I thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and the Clerks, the Door Keepers, the shadow Deputy Leader of the House <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" name="Angela Smith">the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith)</phrase>, every Member who has contributed to the debate, and the civil servants who have provided support to ensure that I and others were well briefed, as well as our constituency and Westminster staff. As Members of Parliament we are uniquely privileged in the positions we hold in this House and none of our work would be possible without the contribution that a whole range of people make to our lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.983.0/30">I will finish with a big smile on my face, just to dispel the notion that I might be auditioning for &#8220;Grinch 3&#8221;. I wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy new year.</p>

	<p pid="b.989.2/1">It is a pleasure to see you in the Chair this evening, Mr Deputy Speaker. I echo your festive greetings and wish you, your family and everyone in the House a merry Christmas. I also thank all the staff who have worked so hard for us over the past year. I would also like to extend Christmas greetings to the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase>, to whom I apologise for detaining him this evening. He has only recently been installed&#8212;or should I say reinstalled?&#8212;in Government and it is a pleasure to have him back, but I am afraid that some of my remarks will be critical of his Department. I am sure that things will start to look up because of his appointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/2">I should first declare an interest as a non-practising solicitor. I have not worked in private practice since I was elected in 2001, but I bring previous experience of working in the criminal justice system in north Wales, as well as in Merseyside and Cheshire. I have many connections, which I maintain, with people working in the criminal justice system in north Wales, including solicitors, barristers, magistrates, magistrates&#8217; clerks, probation officers and police officers.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/3">I have never known such a state of flux in the criminal justice system in north Wales and, even more worryingly, such a lack of information for the community as a whole about the Government&#8217;s justice policy and how it will operate in future. It is creating enormous uncertainty for court staff, businesses connected to the courts and magistrates who commit time and substantial energy to the service, as well as for court users generally.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/4">Magistrates courts and criminal justice are important to their communities. Summary justice is hundreds of years old, and it depends upon local input for effectiveness. It is indeed ironic that a Government who purport to promote localism appear determined to raze local justice from the map. What is this Government&#8217;s agenda for north Wales?</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/5">Magistrates and solicitors approached me early this year, when Her Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunals Service in Wales issued a consultation document on the review of local justice areas in North Wales, the gist of which was to merge six magistrates court benches into three. When I read it, I was struck by the fact that none of the reasons given for that proposal referred to court users, but instead focused on issues such as</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/6">&#8220;a more cost effective and viable financial base&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/7">and &#8220;reduced administrative burdens&#8221;, as well as</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/8">&#8220;improved flexibility in the listing of cases within larger justice areas&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/9">In my town of Wrexham, there is real concern about the proposed merger of the local bench, which has been established for hundreds of years, with Flintshire. That would enable Wrexham cases to be listed in Mold, which would have a substantial impact on defendants, witnesses, lawyers, probation officers, magistrates and clerks. It would be the latest in a long line of changes to court work in north Wales that have centralised fine enforcement, road traffic cases and TV licensing work, taking local work away from courts in an effort to centralise.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/10">The effect in Wrexham might be even more profound, as North Wales police currently intend to move custody facilities from the town centre to Llay, which is situated between Wrexham and Mold. The current custody facilities are immediately adjacent to Wrexham magistrates court, but I am concerned that if they move to Llay and the Ministry of Justice succeeds in its bid to merge magistrates benches, the combination of both factors will form part of a future case for moving magistrates&#8217; business away from Wrexham completely. We might be seeing the start of a process that ultimately leads to the closure of the magistrates court in the largest town in north Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/11">I know from speaking to north Wales parliamentary colleagues from all parties that there is real concern across north Wales about the Ministry of Justice&#8217;s courts agenda. In response to the consultation earlier this year, I lodged a detailed submission on <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-21">21 April 2013</phrase>, five days before the closure date. I made various points about the usage of the courts, and I raised issues relating to travel, impacts on local businesses&#8212;they have expressed their concerns to me about the proposal&#8212;and the additional cost to the public purse from increased travel costs. I concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/12">&#8220;I would also welcome the opportunity to discuss these matters with Wrexham Magistrates.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/13">I heard nothing for some time.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/14">It is striking how remote the criminal justice system is from Members of Parliament in north Wales. There appears to be no willingness to engage with us on the part of the Ministry of Justice or Her Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunals Service. That contrasts with our relations with the police force, the chief constable and even the new police and crime commissioner. The Ministry of Justice seems to be pursuing various agendas, thick and fast, without any consultation with the local community. What is the policy on courts and probation, and where is it leading? Even on the issue of Wrexham prison, where more information has been given, we still do not know whether it will be run by the public or private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/15">The roaring silence in response to my submission on court mergers continued. I wrote chasing e-mails. Eventually, on <phrase class="date" code="2013-05-22">22 May</phrase>, I was informed that the consultation had been withdrawn</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/16">&#8220;as there was insufficient support from amongst the magistrates for a merger to proceed at this time&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/17">I was then astonished to be informed by local solicitors that the court service had cancelled the sittings in Wrexham on Mondays and that they were to be heard at Mold. It appeared that the proposals that had been envisaged in the consultation document were being taken forward despite the consultation and despite the reasoning that had been given by the local justices&#8217; clerk for the withdrawal of the consultation. The proposals were proceeding without anyone bothering to have a consultation and expressly against the wishes of the local magistrates, who had not supported them.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/18">The court is crucial to Wrexham. It is the biggest town in north Wales and a population centre. It is served by bus routes in a way that Mold is not and it supports small and larger solicitors practices that employ my constituents. Moving the magistrates court is of such importance to various groups in the town that they contacted me&#8212;something that they do not do often. They have asked me to look after their interests and the</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/19">interests of the town. However, the court service has still not met me, despite my request, to tell me what is going on. I am willing to meet it, but I feel excluded.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/20">Not everyone is excluded from the consultation. A lot of private discussion has been going on, from which the public and other interested parties have been cut out since the withdrawal of the public consultation document. On <phrase class="date" code="2013-07-02">2 July</phrase> this year, the Secretary of State for Justice attended a political meeting of Wrexham Conservatives. In a report to Wrexham magistrates in August 2013, Sally Kenyon, the chair of the Wrexham bench said:</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/21">&#8220;I had the pleasure of meeting Chris Grayling&#8230;in Wrexham in July. I raised our concern that Wrexham is to lose the police cells adjacent to the court building&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/22">There is then a substantial passage setting out the views of the Secretary of State on his plans relating to the Ministry of Justice estate in north Wales. It quotes extensively, but selectively, from correspondence with the chair of the Wrexham bench. The Secretary of State concluded his correspondence by saying that</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/23">&#8220;there are no firm plans in relation to the relocation of criminal work to Mold.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/24">When I wrote to the Secretary of State subsequently for information on his discussions concerning Wrexham courts, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/25">&#8220;The purpose of my visit to Wrexham was for a private luncheon, rather than Departmental business&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/26">It is very clear, however, that departmental business was discussed at that private luncheon. In his letter to me of <phrase class="date" code="2013-10-10">10 October</phrase>, on Ministry of Justice notepaper, the Secretary of State concludes with the same phrase that he used in his letter to the chair of the Wrexham bench:</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/27">&#8220;there are no firm plans in relation to the relocation of criminal work to Mold&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/28">In a letter to the Minister, I asked to meet him to find out about the agenda of the Ministry of Justice for the courts in north Wales. I am still waiting for a reply. A series of written parliamentary questions on the issue were answered with obfuscation and avoidance. I have, therefore, secured this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/29">Will the Minister please confirm that the Secretary of State conducted departmental business at what he described as a &#8220;private luncheon&#8221;? In particular, will he confirm that the Secretary of State discussed Wrexham magistrates court and Wrexham police cells with the chair of Wrexham bench? Will he release the full text of the Secretary of State&#8217;s letter to the chair of Wrexham magistrates bench so that the public can have confidence in the process, and so that all magistrates can see the full text of the correspondence? Does the Minister think it appropriate that the people of north Wales should be excluded from discussions on the future of criminal justice in north Wales? Does he think it appropriate for privileged access to the Secretary of State to be given to individuals because of political connections?</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/30">Will the Minister please arrange a briefing session for north Wales MPs to tell us, openly and honestly&#8212;as I am sure he will&#8212;what HM Courts Service intends to propose for north Wales? We had a consultation that was withdrawn as long ago as April, and actions have been taken by HM Courts Service to bring together services since then without any consultation or anyone having the opportunity to make representations. Does</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/31">the MOJ have any intention to consult the people of Wrexham and, more broadly, of north Wales, on its proposals for courts in north Wales?</p>
	<p pid="b.989.2/32">The way this issue has been handled to date is, quite simply, the worst I have encountered in 12 years as an MP. It has been conducted evasively, incompetently and, quite bluntly, with secrecy. I hope that the Minister will now open up the process so that MPs and the people of north Wales can be consulted about the criminal justice system in our area, and so that we know what is going on and can make appropriate representations.</p>

	<p pid="b.992.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40675" name="Ian Lucas">the hon. Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas)</phrase> for the kind comments he made at the outset of his remarks about my appointment. I assure him that it is no inconvenience for me to be here today, notwithstanding the fact that it is the last debate before the Christmas recess. I congratulate him on securing this debate. It is an important issue&#8212;all the more reason why I am pleased to be here&#8212;not only for the hon. Gentleman but for his constituents. That is evident from the number of parliamentary questions he has submitted, the correspondence in which he has engaged, and the fact he has secured this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.0/2">The hon. Gentleman raised a number of issues, and I hope that during my speech I will address some of his concerns. I apologise that the letter he wrote to me received a reply that was sent by e-mail only yesterday. As a colleague, I appreciate how many e-mails we all get, but it is somewhere in the system and I apologise for the delay, which should not have happened. I appreciate that the hon. Gentleman has had difficulty trying to arrange meetings with local judicial staff and, as far as I am able, I will try to assist to facilitate that meeting for him and his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.0/3">It is important to recognise two issues. We are talking about the potential merger of two benches, which is a matter for the judiciary. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that constitutionally, the judiciary is independent of the Executive. A potential merger of benches is a matter for the magistrates to come to a conclusion on, working with the justice clerk. The management of Her Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunals Service falls within the Ministry of Justice, so there is departmental responsibility at our end. As I proceed with my remarks, I hope I will address some of the issues raised by the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.0/4">Let me be clear at the outset: the delivery of criminal justice is a crucial priority for the Government. That is why, among other measures, we are investing in the digital courtroom, as part of the strategy and action plan for reform of the criminal justice system. The hon. Gentleman will appreciate that effective magistrates courts are the cornerstone of our justice system. They deal with 95% of the criminal cases that go through the courts in England and Wales.</p>

	<p pid="b.992.1/1">The work that magistrates do in north Wales and across the court service is absolutely vital. The partnership between the magistracy and officials who manage the courts is an essential prerequisite for</p>
	<p pid="b.992.1/2">the successful operation of our magistrates courts. In the case of magistrates courts, this partnership is built up through regular meetings between bench chairs and officials, providing the opportunity to discuss the conduct of court business, including listing arrangements. It is therefore to be expected that the chairs of Wrexham and Mold benches would discuss the potential arrangement of local justice areas in north Wales during meetings with officials.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.1/3">As the hon. Gentleman is aware, the local justices issues group concluded in late 2012 that the reorganisation of local justice areas, including the merger of the Wrexham and Flintshire local justice areas, would provide the most efficient framework for the administration of justice in north Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.992.1/4">I am aware that the hon. Gentleman took the time and trouble to respond in detail to the consultation. However, as he will be aware, the consultation was suspended when it became clear that the wider proposals for north Wales no longer had the support of all the bench chairs, as had been previously understood. Following further consideration, the proposals were withdrawn. I hope the hon. Gentleman will take away from that the fact that the voice of the people who took the trouble to take part in the consultation was heard. This is a decision based on views taken in by outsiders, and not on decisions taken at the top.</p>

	<p pid="b.993.0/1">On that point, the difficulty is that steps were taken subsequently, in terms of the transfer of business between the two courts, that seem to pursue the agenda suggested in the withdrawn consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.993.1/1">I appreciate where the hon. Gentleman is coming from, but the listing of cases is a matter for the judiciary to decide as it sees best so that it can get the business done and hear as many cases as possible. It is important to recognise that distinction. As far as the consultation is concerned, it was pulled. I understand that there is talk among the magistrates&#8212;not at the Ministry of Justice end, but among the magistrates&#8212;that there may be another consultation, but that is a matter I hope he will be able to address in direct communications with them. As I said at the outset, I will try to facilitate a meeting for him.</p>
	<p pid="b.993.1/2">It is important to appreciate that any new proposals to merge local justice areas in north Wales would be subject to a consultation. I am aware that the bench chairmen for Flintshire and Wrexham are keen to consult on mergers, because they believe they will result in a more efficient and effective structure for the magistracy in north-east Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.993.1/3">If a consultation does go ahead, all local magistrates, local authorities, members of the local criminal justice board and other interested parties&#8212;including, of course, all local MPs and other locally elected officials&#8212;will be able to comment. It would be for the justices clerk and the local justices issues group to consider the responses to the consultation and, should there be a case for merger, they will then formulate their final recommendation in respect of the new structure.</p>
	<p pid="b.993.1/4">In considering changes to local justice areas, account will of course be taken of access to justice and how to deal effectively with the business of magistrates courts. This will include the needs of local communities and the wider criminal justice system infrastructure, the</p>
	<p pid="b.993.1/5">deployment of magistrates and their need for support, and the workload and deployment of Her Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunals Service staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.993.1/6">I emphasise that changes to local justice areas take place periodically and are driven by the need to create listing efficiencies and deploy magistrates as efficiently as possible. If a new consultation on changes to local justice areas in north Wales takes place, it should not be viewed as an automatic precursor to the closure of a courthouse. As the hon. Gentleman will be aware, North Wales police has announced plans, following public consultation, to improve service provision in north Wales, but these will not automatically lead to the closure of magistrates courts. We are aware that the police will vacate their existing premises in Wrexham in 2016-17, which will have implications for the court and how it deals with custody cases, but when circumstances change in this way, the Courts and Tribunals Service will need to assess the most appropriate way for criminal cases to be effectively delivered in the area.</p>
	<p pid="b.993.1/7">The hon. Gentleman might feel that the lack of cells will automatically lead to the closure of the court, but that is not the case. He did not dwell on this in his speech, but he will be aware of it and the consultation by the local police. I can reassure him that an open and transparent consultation process is used when deciding whether to close a court. Crucially, any proposals on the future of a court are considered with emphasis on the local area and how justice is best served there. Several factors will be taken into consideration before starting a consultation, including an assessment of the work load and utilisation of the court. The Courts and Tribunals Service also takes into account whether a suitable alternative location for the work is available and whether it could be accommodated elsewhere without a detrimental impact on service levels. If a consultation is published, it is important that local stakeholders and partners and elected officials be properly engaged to ensure that all relevant views are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.993.1/8">There is then a full analysis of all responses received before any decision is made. The response to the consultation is always accompanied by an impact assessment. I hope that this reassures the hon. Gentleman that when there are proposals to change the deployment of magistrates or the court estate, proper and distinct processes are followed, ensuring that decisions are made only once the views of relevant parties have been considered through the open and transparent consultation processes. I stress that the Government are committed to providing court users in north Wales with proper and effective access to justice. In so doing, hard-working taxpayers rightly expect us to reduce the cost of operating courts and tribunals while maintaining an effective service for court users.</p>
	<p pid="b.993.1/9">In this country, we have one of the best justice systems in the world. Whatever decisions are taken, it is always central to our thought process that we ensure this world-class justice system continues. On that note, I conclude by wishing you, Mr Deputy Speaker, the court officials and the hon. Gentleman a merry Christmas. Also, I extend a special greeting to the security staff, who look after us while we do our work and ensure we can do it safely.</p>
