	<p pid="a.1.6/1">Spending on council tax benefit doubled under the last Administration, and welfare reform is vital to tackle the budget deficit we inherited from the last Labour Government. Replacing council tax benefit with local support schemes gives councils control over how to achieve a 10% saving, and a direct incentive to help local people into work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.8/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will make the case clearly to his own local authority, which is looking at a scheme at the moment that would not necessarily do the most to help local people into work. The whole point of what we are doing is that it will give local councils the power to be part of their local economy, to drive economic growth and to get people back into work.</p>

	<p pid="a.1.9/1">One council told the Communities and Local Government Select Committee that the reduction would create additional financial pressures through administration and debt collection, as well as having an effect on services such as debt advice, welfare support and housing advice, and a huge effect on homelessness.

	<p pid="a.1.10/1">Similarly, I hope that the hon. Gentleman will talk to Corby council about coming up with a scheme that will help people back into work. Our scheme will give local authorities the power to look at what their communities need and to deliver for their communities. It will then be up to the communities to hold their councils to account, as I hope they will in Corby.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman gives me another chance to highlight that what we are doing is taking control of a situation in which council tax doubled under the last Government and council tax benefits rose from around &#163;2 billion to &#163;4.5 billion. That benefit has to be got under control as part of deficit reduction, and I wonder whether it would be part of the &#163;52 billion of cuts from his own Government&#8217;s proposals that he has not yet even outlined.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.2/1">Once again, we have no answer to a straight, factual question. The Minister is in denial. The answer is 20% in Brentwood. Why is that? It is because councils up and down the country, Tory and Labour, have been put in an impossible position by Ministers. Is it not the truth that</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/2">&#8220;the very lowest paid are going to be in a very difficult place&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="a.3.2/3">Those are not my words but those of the Conservative leader of the Local Government Association. While the Secretary of State has been travelling up and down the country lecturing councils about not increasing their council tax, he has all along been masterminding a council tax increase for those who can least afford it. Does he not understand that the public will see that happening in the very same month that the top rate of tax is cut, and that they will say, &#8220;This is unfair&#8221;?</p>

	<p pid="a.3.3/1">I am afraid that the right hon. Gentleman oversimplifies things. Local authorities have, as we have said, the right to look at their local communities and design schemes that they think are right for them, in contrast to the central diktat that the last Government used to impose. The authority that he has mentioned in Brentwood is a good example, because what he did not mention was the way it had changed the taper to ensure that it will pay to work.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">I am grateful for that answer. Business rates for shops are a particular concern for small shops in my constituency. Has my hon.

	<p pid="a.4.1/1">We are collecting that information right now, and we will present it to the House shortly. What I can say is that we have given new powers to councils to be able to provide further business rate discounts, and also the flexibility to be able to use them when and where they think is best. I would strongly encourage councils, whether they be in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency or elsewhere, to use those powers so they can better help their high streets.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.2/1">Small shops in Crediton, an important market town in my constituency, suffered greatly under the last Government&#8217;s planning guidelines, which pushed up car parking charges in the centre of town and pushed away trade.

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">We have scrapped Labour&#8217;s red tape so that councils can be far more flexible about the way in which car parking charges and associated rules work. That will enable more people to be attracted into excellent towns such as Crediton in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency. Again, I urge councils to be more innovative in how they manage to make their charges for parking.

	<p pid="a.4.5/1">No, I do not agree. As I have said to the British Property Federation on several occasions, we looked very carefully at the valuation office evidence that was presented to us. What it showed was that for every three businesses that might gain, eight could lose&#8212;including, potentially, a loss of &#163;100 million to retailing in London. That is why we have taken what I think is the correct decision to defer that revaluation until 2017.</p>

The figures show that the scheme that gives the weighting for deprivation is essentially unchanged from Labour&#8217;s scheme, apart from one significant change.

However, I would point out that in meetings that my officials and I have had with people from rural networks we have confirmed that the gap is narrowing thanks to changes that we made in the settlement. It is becoming smaller than it ever was under the previous Government, who put the finances in a situation that was detrimental to rural areas across the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.23.2/1">The Government have today laid before the House the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill and their response to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards report, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-21">21 December 2012</phrase> following the commission&#8217;s pre-legislative scrutiny of a draft Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/2">I thank and pay tribute to the members of both the Independent Commission on Banking and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. The two commissions, whose membership comprises some of the most distinguished policy makers and formidable intellects in the world, have between them shaped a set of reforms to British banking that will lead the world and set an example to other countries in the seriousness, radicalism and meticulousness of the changes that are proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/3">The Bill published today reflects their painstaking work and the Government have accepted almost all their recommendations. The reforms address what the Chancellor has called the British dilemma&#8212;how Britain can be a leading global financial centre with more than its fair share of international trade in financial services while at the same time not exposing ordinary working people in this country to the catastrophic risks of banks failing.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/4">The reforms were and are necessary because the previous regime was tested and failed. UK taxpayers had to bail out the banks with &#163;65 billion of the hard-earned money of ordinary working people, while those who had taken a one-way bet with that money slunk away, losing nothing more than their jobs, and sometimes not even that. The anger that the country feels about what happened must be channelled into change to reset Britain&#8217;s banking system. The objective of the Bill&#8212;proposed by Vickers and endorsed by the commission&#8212;is that any failure of any bank in future should not impose a cost on the taxpayer and not interrupt for a second vital banking services. That is a high ambition, but one that is appropriate for a country with the reputation for financial stability and confidence, which has for centuries been one of Britain&#8217;s chief assets in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/5">As is well known, the Bill will erect a ring fence around the core operations of banks headquartered and regulated in the UK. Within that ring fence, banks must be completely insulated from activities such as using depositors&#8217; funds to speculate for the banks&#8217; own benefit in capital markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/6">As a result of the commission&#8217;s recommendations, the Government are making a number of further changes to the Bill. First, in the acute phrase of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>, which will permanently enter the lexicon of banking, the ring fence will be &#8220;electrified&#8221;. The regulator will be given the power to order the full separation of any bank that attempts to undermine the ring fence. Directors of the</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/7">banks will be personally responsible for ensuring that their banks comply with the ring-fencing rules, and the Prudential Regulatory Authority will conduct an annual review of the operation and adequacy of the ring-fence rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/8">Secondly, there are explicit provisions on the face of the Bill for the principal aspects of ring-fencing, including that there should be separate boards of directors, remuneration arrangements, treasury management operations, balance sheet management and human resource management of ring-fenced banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/9">Thirdly, the Bill gives us an opportunity to make an historic change in the competitive environment in UK banking. Competition is essential to ensure that customers benefit from innovation and from demanding customer service and efficiency from their banks. That has not always been customers&#8217; experience in the past. As well as bringing in a seven-day automatic account switching service from September this year, the Government will take steps to tackle the cosy arrangement whereby the banks determine how payment systems will be run. Why should it be necessary in 2013 for a cheque to take six days to clear, with the banks and not the customers scooping up the interest on the balances during the delay? Why should a new bank have to beg an incumbent bank for permission to use their payment system? We will therefore require access to payment services that are fair, reasonable and transparent. The commission has rightly emphasised the importance of competition, and I am grateful to it for propelling that drive further, as I am to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40550" name="Andrea Leadsom">the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom)</phrase> for what she has done on greater competition in banking, which has been a personal crusade of hers.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/10">The fourth and final change is that more parliamentary scrutiny will be built into the secondary legislation that implements what is a high-level Bill. Drafts of the principal statutory instruments to be made will be made available to the House before Second Reading, and the Government accept the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee on the type of scrutiny each should receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.23.2/11">These are historic reforms, but it is appropriate that, in our country&#8212;directly and indirectly, 2 million people work in the industry, it is our biggest export earner, and contributes &#163;1 in every &#163;8 of our tax revenue&#8212;we take the steps necessary to restore confidence in, and to, an industry that has fallen so far. There is much scrutiny of the Bill before us, both here and in the House of Lords, and I look forward very much to our discussions during the weeks and months ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.24.0/1">If the Government believed this issue was important, would the Chancellor have not made a statement to the House of Commons today? It should not take an urgent question for Parliament to hear why the Government are taking such a half-hearted approach to banking reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/2">In a week when our national banks are facing record-breaking fines for LIBOR manipulation, when the Financial Services Authority is struggling to get a fair deal on payment protection insurance mis-selling for small businesses, whose customers have been mis-sold interest rate hedging products, when we see the bumper bonus season continuing to roll on and on for banking executives as if nothing had happened, and in a week when all this</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/3">suggests we should be getting serious about real reform, what has the Chancellor said in his seaside speech today? He has fudged the tough stance recommended by the Vickers report, and has stopped short on backstop powers and legislation for the leverage ratio envisaged by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, a commission that the Chancellor himself agreed to set up last summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/4">I have to ask the Minister: why then does it feel as though the Chancellor has to be dragged kicking and screaming towards serious reform? Is it because, despite all the rhetoric and feigned concern, the Government know they face certain defeat in the House of Lords on the sensible recommendations of the parliamentary commission, and so think it best to try and salvage something from what is in reality a strategic retreat? Why will the Minister not legislate for a full reserve power for total separation of retail and investment banking if ring-fencing does not work, something that we called for last year and the commission specifically recommended? Surely it would be sensible to legislate now, not just if one or two individual banks misbehave, but in case ring-fencing fails the sector as a whole. He may think he has found a cunning ploy, but stopping short with only half the backstop powers just means that they are unlikely to be used. Corporate lawyers across the City will be rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of taking on the regulator on a case-by-case basis. Worse still, why is he ducking the main conclusion of the Vickers report? Specifically, why is he refusing to adopt the commission&#8217;s recommendations on the leverage ratio and rein in the over-exposure of banks whose excessive risk-taking caused the problems in the first place?</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/5">Should there not be a clause in the Bill so that regulators can restrain such hazardous behaviour? Does the Minister agree that the implementation of the Bill needs a full parliamentary review on a regular basis, with genuine scrutiny of detailed secondary legislation on exactly how ring-fencing will work in practice? If the commission recommends a tougher code of conduct for bankers, proper professional qualifications and a fiduciary duty of care for customers, together with stronger controls on bonuses and remuneration, will he accept its judgment in the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/6">With the economy flatlining and no plan for growth, why is there nothing in the Bill to improve the funding for lending scheme? We should not still be seeing lending to businesses falling further and further, month after month. The Minister has to realise that the public, the taxpayers and Parliament want to tackle this issue once and for all. The Bill needs further amendment, and if the Government do not have the courage to radically reform the banks, we will.</p>

	<p pid="a.25.0/1">I had rather hoped for a serious response to a serious matter. When the Bill has its Committee stage, I hope the hon. Gentleman, with whom I am happy to work on the details, will be able to make some more substantial reflections than those he has offered the House today. Frankly, the idea that the Opposition should have the brass neck to table an urgent question on banking reform is almost unbelievable. At no point in 13 years of power did they show a scintilla of urgency in facing up to, never mind solving, the catastrophic absence of banking reform that led to the financial</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/2">crisis being particularly damaging to this country. The failure of the botched regulatory system they introduced in 1997 has played a large part in the burden that the ordinary working people of this country are still having to shoulder today to bail out the banks. They were in office after the crisis, too. Even then they did nothing urgent apart from hurriedly plunge their heads in the sand to hope that the nightmare would pass.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/3">It has fallen to this Government&#8212;as it regularly does, I am afraid&#8212;urgently to clear up the chaos in which Labour left the country. It should not have taken so long, but since the Government have been elected&#8212;from the beginning of our tenure in 2010&#8212;we have set up the Independent Commission on Banking, which has done a superb job, and we have created a separate conduct regulator and a prudential regulator that are now on the statute book. Why did we need to wait for this Government to be elected to do that? Why did Labour not set up a parliamentary commission on banking standards? <i>[Interruption.] </i>Of course, I will answer the pitifully few points that the hon. Gentleman made.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/4">The hon. Gentleman asked, perfectly reasonably, why we had not given the Bank of England the power to split up the whole banking system. One of the principal reasons for not doing so was that the Governor of the Bank of England, in evidence to the commission, said that he did not want that power. It would seem odd to foist on the Governor a power that he does not want. The hon. Gentleman also asked why we did not adopt the higher backstop ratio. One concern expressed was by building societies worried about being disadvantaged by that. That was a concern we had.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.0/5">The hon. Gentleman asked about a full review. If he had read closely the statement we published in response to the commission&#8217;s report, he would have known that the PRA would conduct a full annual review of the ring-fencing rules, and we will obviously act on any recommendations that it makes. He also asked about further recommendations that might come from the commission, which is chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester. The hon. Gentleman seems surprised that, having set up the commission, we might be interested in taking seriously its recommendations. I hope it is apparent from our response today that we take its recommendations very seriously, and I look forward to its further recommendations, particularly on competition, which have a great deal to offer. I greatly respect the commission&#8217;s work and look forward to making time available when the next report is published to make the necessary changes to the Bill to accommodate the recommendations.</p>

It might not be known just how many hours of the day they are working on it, but they are doing a service to the country in doing so. We accept his recommendation.

	<p pid="a.27.1/1">I welcome the change of heart announced by the Chancellor today. It is in contrast to the dismissive noises that came from the Government when our report was published just before Christmas. I am sure that that change of heart had nothing to do with the vision of amendments in the other place being supported by one of the Chancellor&#8217;s predecessors, Lord Lawson, a former Cabinet permanent secretary and the new Archbishop of Canterbury.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.1/2">I would like to ask the Minister why today&#8217;s response was silent on the commission&#8217;s recommendation for a general reserve power for the sector as a whole. I must correct him: if adopted, such a decision should not be left to the Bank of England, but be taken by the Chancellor.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.2/1">I am grateful for the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question, to whom I extend my thanks for serving with distinction on the commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/2">I said that the Bank of England did not want a general reserve power, but the right hon. Gentleman made the perfectly valid point that it might not necessarily be a choice for the Bank. It seems to me, however, that the power to break up any individual bank is a very strong one, and quite rightly, as the commission recommended, it would make the ring fence more impenetrable. Nevertheless, to provide for a reserve power in this Bill that would change the whole system would, in effect, be a different policy. I understand the reasons for wanting to do that, as many distinguished members of the commission do, but changing the whole policy would deserve the scrutiny of a Bill of its own&#8212;any future Government would be free to introduce such a Bill. To have it as a rider to a Bill designed to implement the Vickers report would be the wrong step forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.2/3">Finally, as for accepting amendments, there are several Members of this House who have served on Bill Committees with me in the past. My demeanour, now and throughout the passage of the Bill, will be to listen to good and sensible suggestions from wherever they come&#8212;not to treat this as an exercise in partisanship, but to try to find consensus on the best system for financial regulation in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.28.0/1">My right hon. Friend is right when he talks about our most important industry&#8212;certainly in terms of exports and what it contributes to the taxes that pay for public services. It is significant that more euros are traded in this country than across the entire eurozone. For that reason, we need to continue to have access to the single market and to argue&#8212;as I and the Chancellor do in ECOFIN after ECOFIN&#8212;to ensure that we secure our interests there. That is a constant fight, but I know that I and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor will always take that view when we are in Brussels.</p>

It is quite right that it should proceed with consideration and that we should not introduce things that might have unintended consequences without adequate consideration in this House. The Government are obviously the major shareholder in RBS. It is important that RBS should be returned as swiftly as possible to private hands.

I therefore welcome the ring-fencing and the provision to separate a given bank if necessary. However, I am not yet convinced of the need for the reserve power to separate any bank.

	<p pid="a.29.2/1">My hon. Friend and I completely agree about the need for more competition in the banking sector. It is one of the features of the banking crisis that it has resulted in a concentration in the number of banks. Frankly, there were never enough in the first place, and we need urgently to see more new entrant banks of all types coming in. We are working with the existing regulatory authorities and, through amendments to the Bill, we will transform the state of competition in the banking sector. I very much hope to see an infusion of new energy and talent into the banking system in this country.</p>

One thing regulators will want to look at is how they can quickly make accounts portable between customers. That, however,</p>

	<p pid="a.31.5/1">I have explained on a number of occasions why we have not done so. One reason is that the regulator does not want that power, and a second reason is that it seems to us more appropriate that individual banks feel the consequences of their breach. The system itself does not have a mind to breach the rules; it is individual banks that do so. It is thus appropriate for the sanctions to apply to individual banks.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.1/1">The Minister is absolutely right to say that the reputation of our banks has never been lower. We hope that we will start to see the important changes we need. One reason for that reputation is the experience that many small businesses had with interest rate swap agreements. While many welcome the FSA announcement on that, there are still some concerns about whether people will really consider that they have had justice at the end of the process. Will the Minister confirm what representations he has made to the FSA about what it should find during the deliberations, and will he give us any assurances that the interest rate swap problems we have had in the past will not reappear in future?</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/1">The hon. Gentleman raises a very important point. I met the Federation of Small Businesses and the Bully-Banks organisation and I conveyed their concerns to the FSA, which the hon. Gentleman knows is set up to be the independent regulator. I think most people were relieved that the FSA proposals of last week will result in compensation for the affected businesses within a rapid time frame. What happened is totally unacceptable, and is another feature of the scandalous decline in reputation that the banks have suffered. Small businesses in particular have a right to regard their bank manager as someone who acts in their interests, rather than someone who flogs them dodgy products that they do not need in the first place. That is a breach of trust in banking. I am absolutely insistent that the FSA should conclude this process, giving full recompense to those who have been mis-sold products.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.3/1">The retail ring fence is a good idea, but the real game-changer for banking will be the introduction of full bank account number portability, because it will break open the oligopoly banks.

Breaking open competition and introducing new challenger banks is of key importance.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right: we need to protect the ring fence from the ingenuity of the lawyers who are sometimes in the vicinity. The history of financial regulation shows that banks have been able to discover ways of circumventing the rules, which is why we have given the regulator robust powers to insist on the full separation into retail and investment of any bank that makes any attempt to breach those rules.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-04a.35.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40490" speakername="Justine Greening" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for International Development"  colnum="35"  time="016:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0001.htm#13020412000695">
	<p pid="a.35.1/1">With your permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on the United Kingdom&#8217;s response to the humanitarian crisis in the Syrian region. On <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-30">30 January</phrase>, I attended the UN high level humanitarian pledging conference on Syria in Kuwait. The conference was co-hosted by the Emir of Kuwait and the United Nations Secretary-General, and had two objectives. The first was to raise the international profile of the deepening humanitarian crisis unfolding across the Syrian region. The second was to secure $1.5 billion of urgently needed funding requested by the UN to meet the humanitarian needs it has seen until June 2013&#8212;that represents the largest ever short-term appeal by the UN.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/2">The pledging conference took place at a critical point in the Syria crisis. The humanitarian needs across the region are immense and show no signs of decreasing while the fighting continues. I would like to set out some of the numbers for the House, which illustrate the severity of the situation: 743,000&#8212;nearly three quarters of a million&#8212;is the number of Syrians who have had to seek refuge outside their country; 4 million is the number of people still in need in Syria; 2 million is the number of people displaced in Syria; 60,000 is the number of Syrians killed in the conflict so far; and 26 is the number of aid workers who have been killed in Syria while helping those in desperate need.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/3">During my visit to Jordan just over a week ago, I was able to meet some of the people affected by the crisis. Walking through the Za&#8217;atari refugee camp and meeting families who had welcomed refugees into their homes, I was heartened by the scope of the humanitarian response, and by the resilience of mind and spirit shown by the people I met. The people of Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and now Egypt are showing tremendous generosity, supporting the hundreds of thousands of people who have fled the violence. It is essential that the Governments of those countries receive adequate support for their efforts from the international community.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/4">I also commend the UN for its strong leadership of the international humanitarian response and the partnerships it has built. Its efforts have kept thousands of people sheltered and fed every month in contested, Government and opposition-held areas in Syria, and more than a million children protected against life-threatening diseases such as measles and polio. Those achievements are a reminder of the UN&#8217;s capacity and reach, if given adequate political and financial support, and demonstrate that the UK&#8217;s confidence in the multilateral aid system has not been misplaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/5">At the Kuwait conference, I announced another &#163;50 million of new UK aid towards the UN appeals. That was in addition to the &#163;21 million that I announced on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-26">26 January</phrase> during my visit to Jordan&#8212;&#163;10 million of which was specifically for Jordan&#8212; and brings the UK&#8217;s total humanitarian support for the response to the Syria crisis to &#163;139.5 million. I am very pleased to report the successful outcome of the conference. As well as the UK, more than 60 countries participated in the pledging conference and raised over $1.5 billion, exceeding the UN&#8217;s target. I welcome the generosity that was shown by donors, particularly those from the Gulf region; Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/6">Emirates together pledged $900 million. I should take this opportunity to again thank the Emir of Kuwait for hosting such an important conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/7">I also commend my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary for the support provided by his Department in lobbying donor countries to attend and pledge funds at the Kuwait conference. The next priority for my Department is to see that those pledges are turned into tangible commitments so that the humanitarian agencies can scale up their activities and provide the food, shelter, health and medical care that are so urgently needed by the millions of men, women and children affected by the crisis. However, although the Kuwait conference was a success, we must be realistic. The more than $1.5 billion raised, although a great sum, will support the humanitarian response only until June. The Syrian people will still need help long after that, and the shocking level of human suffering inside and outside Syria will keep rising while the conflict continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.35.1/8">A political settlement is sorely needed. The UK remains steadfast in our support for the joint UN and Arab League special representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, in his work towards a political settlement and transition process. It is also vital that the UN-led humanitarian response be given agreement for increased access to all areas of the country, including the ability to reach people in need across conflict lines and from neighbouring countries if necessary. Until this happens, pockets of need will persist despite the UN&#8217;s best efforts. The dire humanitarian situation deserves the continued attention and support of this Government, and I commit my Department to that effort. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of her statement. The right hon. Lady and I differ on many things, but I begin by paying tribute to her for the good and important work she has done to galvanise an international response to the grave humanitarian crisis arising from the conflict in Syria. She deserves support from both sides of the House for her efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/2">Although the international community has largely focused on the political and security aspects of the conflict, the scale of the humanitarian impact in Syria and across its borders has been enormous. As the right hon. Lady highlights, more than 700,000 people have fled unrelenting violence, 2 million Syrians are internally displaced and 4 million people are in desperate need of basic assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/3">The situation inside Syria is abysmal. One quarter of schools and one third of public hospitals are not functioning, there are shortages of bread and medicine, and critical infrastructure has been destroyed. The UN estimates that 2 million people who have fled their homes are living without the most basic services: clean water, sanitation and electricity. The harsh winter has compounded their suffering and many are living in shelters lacking adequate insulation with no winter clothes and no blankets. Even those who still have homes are suffering from the cold, unable to heat their houses owing to shortages of fuel and electricity. With the UN estimating that the number of refugees will surpass 1 million by June, no end to their suffering is in sight.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/4">The success of the UN pledging conference in Kuwait last week will provide much needed support for the millions of Syrians affected by this growing crisis. I welcome the</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/5">Secretary of State&#8217;s announcement of an additional &#163;71 million of UK aid to Syria. Will she clarify where she expects those additional resources to be focused? As she has acknowledged, aid to Syria is a question of not only funding but humanitarian access and respect for international humanitarian law. Donors have repeatedly raised concerns about support reaching all areas of the country. There is limited capacity and expertise in both Government-held and opposition-held areas, with the conflict&#8217;s front lines constantly shifting.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/6">The right hon. Lady has said that we must ensure that co-ordinated aid reaches people across Syria, including agreed cross-line and cross-border work. Will she elaborate on how the Government are assisting NGOs and UN agencies to provide humanitarian access in the area? Is she suggesting that the UK would be open to funding projects outside the UN&#8217;s direct response plans?</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/7">Questions are also being asked about a strategic response to refugees. As the right hon. Lady has acknowledged, thousands of Syrians are arriving in neighbouring countries every day, yet the humanitarian system does not have the capacity to keep up with the growing demands on registration, co-ordination or shelter. The UN estimates that only 20% of Syrian refugees are in camps. What steps is the Department taking to develop a strategic plan with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that ensures that the needs of all refugees are being met?</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/8">The conflict has taken a brutal toll on Syrians, more than 60,000 of whom have been killed. Those who have fled report stories of ongoing violence and human rights violations, including sexual abuse, arbitrary detention and indiscriminate shelling. A report by the International Rescue Committee identifies rape and sexual violence as primary factors in the decision of many Syrians to flee. Given that disturbing revelation, will the Secretary of State assure the House that UK aid will focus on the protection of women against sexual violence? Crucially, the humanitarian crisis will not be resolved until the conflict in Syria is resolved, and we must continue to push for a ceasefire.</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/9">On international efforts to bring about negotiations to stop the fighting, what assessment have the Government made of reports that the head of the major opposition coalition, Moaz al-Khatib, is willing to talk to Government representatives? Will the Secretary of State update the House on what progress the Government have made in encouraging the Syrian national coalition to accept the Geneva plan as the basis for transition? What were the objectives and impact of the reported recent Israeli air strikes in Syria?</p>
	<p pid="a.36.0/10">The brutality of the Assad regime is clear for all to see, but as we seek change in Syria through a ceasefire and political process, it is essential that we do not forget the here and now suffering of the Syrian people. That is why I welcome today&#8217;s statement, and I hope that the Secretary of State will keep the House informed of developments on a regular basis.</p>

	<p pid="a.37.0/1">I very much appreciate the way in which the shadow Secretary of State approached his response. There was a huge effort across the international community to make sure that the donor conference was a success, and the UK certainly did as much as it could to try to make sure that that was the case. The hon. Gentleman asked how the funds would be spent. The &#163;50 million that we donated at the conference will sit</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/2">alongside the UN co-ordinated response to the humanitarian crisis. Of the requested $1.5 billion, about $1 billion goes to helping refugees outside Syria, and about &#163;0.5 billion of that is planned to help people still suffering inside Syria. In relation to how we can make sure that we reach the many parts of Syria that are difficult to get to, we have to take the opportunities, and we work through humanitarian partners all the time. They are neutral and impartial but never the less have the ability to go into parts of Syria that are often contested. Some of them are Government-controlled, some opposition-controlled, but others are still contested, and as I said in my statement, they are dangerous places. We therefore support those humanitarian agencies. When I talk to the people who head up the World Food Programme, for example, they are clear that they have to take opportunities when they arise. They often find a contact whom they believe is trustworthy, and through them can gain access to a new area, and they will take that opportunity. They have to be prepared to act very quickly and flexibly. We support them in doing so, and the main concern for them in recent weeks has been funding, which is why the donor conference was so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/3">As for what the UK has done directly in Syria, we have provided medical support. We have trained&#8212;I think I am right in saying&#8212;250 health workers, and we have helped open about 130 mobile medical units that provide care. We are also providing food and shelter wherever we can. The UN Security Council has called for the Syrian authorities to provide full, immediate and unimpeded access to all areas of Syria so that humanitarian support can get through. That is absolutely vital, and we urge the opposition forces to allow unimpeded access for humanitarian actors. It is critical, if we are to be able to use that $1.5 billion effectively, that we make sure that we have the routes to get through to the people who need our support.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/4">The hon. Gentleman asked about the strategic response, and he is quite right to flag up the fact that this humanitarian crisis is perhaps different from many others with which the Department deals. Often we are dealing with a natural disaster, and people act to tackle the aftermath. This is a humanitarian crisis that has unfolded over many months and seems likely to continue to unfold over a prolonged period. It may be that we have not seen the worst of the humanitarian crisis in relation to Syria, which is why it is vital that Assad goes, and goes now, so that the work to rebuild Syria can begin.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/5">We are talking with the UNHCR and other humanitarian bodies about how we can make sure that we are set up to deal with a crisis that could become significantly worse in the coming months if the violence continues. As I said in my statement, there are 2 million internally displaced people within Syria. Many of the refugees with whom I spoke a couple of weekends ago had tried their best to stay in Syria. They had moved from Homs to a different place, to a different place again and so on, but were finally left with no choice but to leave Syria. If just a fraction of the 2 million internally displaced people end up having to leave Syria and become refugees, we will see a dramatic increase in the humanitarian problems outside Syria. That is why the donor conference was so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/6">I can assure the hon. Gentleman that we are looking at how we can make sure that we are positioned to take care of those people. For neighbouring countries such</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/7">as Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey, the strain and the pressure put on them are immense. We should always bear that in mind when we are looking at the support that we provide. As he rightly pointed out, most of the refugees in Jordan, for example, are not in camps but in host communities. When I was in Jordan I was told that the local education system has had to absorb 22,000 children who arrived with refugee families. There are significant challenges ahead, which is why we need to continue to keep international attention focused on a very grave humanitarian situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/8">The hon. Gentleman asked about women and girls, and he is right to do so. We have been particularly concerned to make sure that we have supported children. One in five of the people turning up at the Za&#8217;atari refugee camp that I visited was a child aged four or under. Nearly 60% of the refugees who have turned up at that camp were 30 or under. Alongside others, we are providing clinical care and counselling to women and we are helping to provide education to children. We are also providing specific support to about 1,800 women we believe are at risk of possibly being coerced into marriage. We are therefore providing support to them to ensure, wherever possible, that that does not happen. The hon. Gentleman will be aware that my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary is raising on the international stage the broader issue of preventing sexual violence in conflict, and it will be one of the subjects that we try to push internationally at the G8.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/9">The hon. Gentleman asked about coalition talks. There is a general recognition in the international community that the solution in Syria is a political one, which will involve talks, including between the coalition and the Government. It is clear from talking with the coalition that any future transitional Government must be one that has no Assad as part of it. I therefore come back to my earlier comments that for things to move forward, it is time for Assad to go so that the rebuilding of Syria can start.</p>
	<p pid="a.37.0/10">Finally, the hon. Gentleman asked about Israeli air strikes. It is too early to speculate on exactly what happened, but we can see that ensuring stability in that region is critical. It is why the donor conference was so important, so that in the short term we have the funding in place at least to deal with the humanitarian crisis. More broadly, we need stability in the Syrian region. That will mean a political solution to the challenges and to the civil war that is under way in Syria.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.4/1">In recent months I have been able to visit camps in Turkey and Jordan for people fleeing Syria. May I endorse what the Secretary of State said about the efforts of the Governments there and elsewhere and of the international agencies, but also mention the incredible generosity of ordinary people in taking Syrian refugees into their own homes? Last night it was estimated that over 2,000 Syrians crossed the border into Jordan. Winter is now coming on, and the Za&#8217;atari camp that she mentioned faces exposure. The donor conference decisions are great, but the UNHCR co-ordinator in Jordan makes it clear that it is not the pledges of money that make the difference but the money actually getting in and being translated into action. What can we do to ensure that aid gets in and that we do not just have pledges?</p>

	<p pid="a.40.5/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right. The UK will certainly be doing our bit to make sure that the pledges made at the donor conference translate into real money that can make a real difference on the ground. Probably about half the $1 billion set aside to help refugees will go to those who are in Jordan. It is worth pointing out that well over 200,000 refugees have arrived in Jordan, and the total population of that country is 6 million, so in the context of its overall</p>
	<p pid="a.40.5/2">population it is a significant influx. It is therefore right that we look at what we can do to help the Jordanian Government, but also the UN agencies there, to deal with that.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I sensed at the conference that one of the most important aspects was not just the fact that the United Nations put out a call for funds that was met&#8212;it was its largest ever call for short-term funds&#8212;but, critically, that there had been real ownership of making sure that target was met by Gulf nations. Not only did Kuwait generously host the conference but key Gulf nations such as the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia and Kuwait itself made substantial donations. That was welcomed throughout the donor conference and I think it shows not only that the region itself recognises the gravity of the situation, but that it is prepared to step up to the plate and be a key partner in delivering the humanitarian aid.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.3/1">I do not believe that Russia made a significant contribution at the donor conference. The most important thing that we would like to achieve with Russia and China is a breakthrough that would enable us to have a UN Security Council resolution, which would be similar to the approach taken in Mali, where it was possible to take action as a result of a consensus across the international spectrum. That UN Security Council resolution cannot be passed at the moment, which, critically, makes it much more complex for us to be able to reach people inside Syria with humanitarian aid. It also makes it much more complex to start the political and diplomatic dialogue needed to reach a long-term settlement. That is what is needed and I am absolutely clear that, although we are providing humanitarian support, the UK has not ruled out any action. Ultimately, however, we want to press forward on a political and diplomatic route.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.0/1">That is something that I have also considered, but it is clear that the UN process and logistics are well set up. The road block over recent weeks has been in funding. The channels and the people are there, but we have not been able to scale up support because the money has not been in place. The donor conference means that that money is now in place and the scale-up can take place. My hon.

Many of those people are in areas that are still contested. It has been very challenging to ensure that there is coverage across the entire country.

	<p pid="a.44.0/1">We know that several thousand refugees have fled across the border into Iraq. In fact, the British Government have directly provided about &#163;2 million of support to refugees who have fled into Iraq. That is a good example of some of the challenges that we face. Iraq is itself in a reconstruction phase, yet it is now also having to cope with additional refugees fleeing from Syria. That is precisely why we should never forget just how important it is for the region to ensure that neighbouring countries that are having to take in refugees are provided with the support that they need to cope.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.1/1">I understand the real dangers faced by people trying to get humanitarian aid to those inside Syria, which my right hon. Friend has mentioned. In my experience, the only way in which that can be done safely in such circumstances is for some kind of security organisation to be set up on the ground. I totally understand why a mandate from the Security Council is not possible, given the Chinese and Russian attitude, but would it be possible for a grouping from the region to get together and put troops on the ground, to provide security for the brave people who are trying to get to parts of Syria where others do not want them to get? Are we working towards that?</p>

	<p pid="a.44.2/1">The short answer is that we do not anticipate that at this point. We are focused on ensuring that the humanitarian agencies that we are using to help to get support into Syria have unimpeded access and channels that they can use to get support through. It is absolutely clear-cut in international law that humanitarian actors should be allowed access, and that is the route that we are using.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.4/1">In practice, the prospect of safe havens is virtually nil, because of course we do not have a request from the Syrian Government for any kind of military intervention. That is an incredibly important point. That country is at civil war, so it is extremely unlikely that we will be able to assure people of any kind of safe haven in a way that is realistically enforceable in practice. We must therefore ensure that the humanitarian channels are open to reach people where they are, and that when people flee Syria and seek refuge in neighbouring countries, we provide humanitarian support for them there.</p>
	<p pid="a.44.4/2">My hon. Friend is absolutely right to point out that we need to consider as many options as we can to provide help to people in their home country of Syria, and that is what we are trying to do. There is no doubt that it will be incredibly difficult as the crisis unfolds, but we are all trying our level best.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I wonder whether you can help in any way. There have been reports of gruesome practices by the Metropolitan police, which have not been denied, whereby the names of dead children have been used by undercover police agents. I put it to you that this is not simply a matter of applying for an Adjournment debate or even going to the Home Affairs Committee, which I believe is looking into the matter. I would hope that the Home Secretary would come to the House and give an explanation. As I understand it, one of the children who died was a boy of four, and another died in a car crash. Again, I emphasise that the Metropolitan police have not denied that the practice took place, although they have not confirmed it. I believe that the House is due an explanation.</p>

	<p pid="a.45.3/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. I know that you champion Back Benchers and their role in holding the Government to account, but it is particularly difficult for Back Benchers such as me, whose constituency contains a proposed rail freight interchange, to find out what happened in the decision-making process. The Department for Transport has been fulsome in its answers, but the same questions to the Treasury and the Department for Communities and Local Government are answered either by referring me to websites or by saying that it would involve disproportionate cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.3/2">Referring an hon. Member to a website does not always work and I have found out about private meetings that are not declared on websites.

	<p pid="a.45.4/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her point of order, and for notice of it. The content of answers is not a matter of order for the Chair, and neither is inconsistency in the way Ministers reply to similar questions. If the hon. Lady is dissatisfied with the answers she has received, she should draw the matter to the attention of the Procedure Committee. Moreover, I add in passing that without regard to the particulars of the case, with which I cannot be expected to be familiar, I have considerable sympathy for the hon. Lady in so far as she is aggrieved by the tendency of some Departments simply to refer right hon. or hon. Members to a website. That is often unavailing, and the intention of Ministers should be to help Members in pursuit of their parliamentary duties. In the best cases, that is what happens, but it ought to be the norm.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.4/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. On <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-16">16 January</phrase> this year, I initiated a Westminster Hall debate on the operation of the local government standards regime. In the course of the debate, I and other hon. Members referred to the standards regime in the London borough of Tower Hamlets and there was subsequent reporting of that. On <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-23">23 January</phrase> there was a meeting of the full council of the London borough of Tower Hamlets. On the same day, the chief executive sent a letter&#8212;I have sent it to your office, Mr Speaker&#8212;the effect of which, I contend, was an attempt to gag any conversation or discussion of what had been discussed in this House. I seek your guidance on this, Mr Speaker. Am I correct in thinking that the advice given by the chief executive of the London borough of Tower Hamlets is erroneous in using the phrase,</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/2">&#8220;the fact that those comments have been made in Parliament does not entitle Councillors to refer or repeat them in Council or elsewhere.&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/3">which ignores the fact that qualified privilege does attach to a bona fide and accurate report of proceedings in this House, made without improper notice?</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/4">Secondly, the advice is erroneous because it says that making such a report might be in breach of the member-officer code of the council, but the internal code of a council cannot override the right of qualified privilege in relation to a report of the House if all other necessary qualifications are met.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.4/5">Thirdly, the attempt by a public body to gag discussion or criticism of it that has been raised in the House is at the very least a discourtesy to the House, if not verging on the contemptuous.</p>

	<p pid="a.46.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point of order and for notice of it. With reference to the use of material outside the House being bona fide or not, that is a matter for the courts, and the hon. Gentleman will not expect me to occupy that territory. However, I can give what I hope is a substantive response to his point of order that is of value to him and the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.46.5/2">I am quite clear that his contribution in Westminster Hall is protected entirely by article 9 of the Bill of Rights. What he said on that occasion may not be impeached or questioned in any court or place outside Parliament. The protection of papers published under the direct authority of this House is also clear. However, the extent of the protection afforded under section 3 of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1840 or otherwise to the repetition in some other place of anything said in this House is, as I have indicated, a matter for the courts, as the Act makes clear&#8212;it would be quite wrong for me to offer any opinion on that question from the Chair. The hon. Gentleman may wish to take up any particular concerns he has on parliamentary freedom of speech with the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege. I hope that is helpful.</p>

You will know that one reason I admire you so much is that you are such a doughty defender of the rights of the House in scrutinising the Executive. You will recall that last week I raised with you the fact that the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill will not be committed to the whole House tomorrow. I have been advised by the Clerks&#8212;indeed, by a very polite gentleman sitting not a million miles from you&#8212;that, although I can table a motion to commit the Bill to the whole House, as I have done, it cannot be debated. Even if Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition or a majority of Members table such a motion, the only people who can commit a Bill to the whole House are the Government. Is that not a democratic lacuna? Is there not something wrong with our procedures? We are faced with an important Bill and constitutional issues concerning the established Church, but nobody apart from the Government has the right to commit it to the whole House.</p>

	<p pid="a.47.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his point of order. What he has just said to the House is substantially correct: the Government&#8217;s motion takes precedence. My understanding is that, once the Government have tabled a motion on the matter he has in mind, another motion cannot be considered before or alongside it. The matter in question is catered for&#8212;albeit very unsatisfactorily in the mind of the hon. Gentleman&#8212;by the Standing Orders of the House. If he or others would</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/2">like the Standing Orders to be revisited and revised, one possible course would be to approach the Procedure Committee and ask it to consider whether to do so. I accept, however, that that does not avail him tomorrow, and he has raised a serious point that he might wish to pursue.</p>
	<p pid="a.47.1/3">So far as tomorrow&#8217;s debate is concerned&#8212;I know the hon. Gentleman has not raised this matter with regard to himself&#8212;a very large number of right hon. and hon. Members will be seeking to catch my eye. My surmise is that he will be one of them. The Chair will seek to be as helpful as time allows. We will have to leave it there for now.</p>

We are satisfied that they are in the best interests of the UK, and are sensible and reasonable. None has a significant domestic impact and, in particular, none will result in any additional financial burdens being imposed on the UK. The provisions in the Bill are technical in nature but will, in their own way, play an important role in the future shape of the EU. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has recently set out the need to examine the UK&#8217;s relationship with the EU. The provisions do not represent far-reaching changes, and there will be further opportunities to examine more fundamental changes in other debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/4">The Bill seeks the approval of Parliament on two proposals brought forward under a legal base of article 352 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union: the proposal to give legal effect to the electronic version of the Official Journal of the European Union; and the proposal for the next the five-year work programme, the multiannual framework, of the Fundamental Rights Agency. Article 352 allows the Union to take action to attain one of the objectives set out in the treaties, but for which there is no specific power set out in those treaties. Any proposal brought forward under this legal base must be agreed unanimously by the Council and gain the consent of the European Parliament, so that at European level there is a high bar for such a proposal to meet.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/5">Forthe UK to agree to this at Council, and for the required unanimity to be secured, Parliament must first give its approval. The Government have put in place further parliamentary controls for proposals brought forward under article 352 of the treaty. Section 8 of the European Union Act 2011 states that a Minister of the Crown may not vote in favour of, or otherwise support, an article 352 decision unless it is approved by an Act of Parliament. Therefore, without the agreement of Parliament a proposal brought forward under this legal base cannot be adopted.</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/6">The EU Commission currently comprises 27 commissioners, one from each member state. The Lisbon treaty provides for a reduction, by one third, in the size of the Commission from <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-01">1 November 2014</phrase>. However, the treaty also allows the European Council to alter the number of commissioners, subject to unanimous agreement. To secure Ireland&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="a.49.2/7">ratification of the treaty, it was agreed that a decision would be taken to maintain the number of EU commissioners at the equivalent of one per member state. Section 7 of the European Union Act 2011 provides that a Minister of the Crown may not vote in favour of such a decision unless the draft decision is approved by Act of Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.0/1">The previous Lord Chancellor thought that the second draft decision, on the multi-annual financial framework, did not require an Act of Parliament because it fell under article 308 of the previous treaties&#8212;now section 352 of the new treaties. Do the Government have a clear position on whether anything previously under article 308 will now always require an Act of Parliament?</p>

	<p pid="a.50.1/1">That level has not been reached. My hon.

Friend will also be aware, the European Scrutiny Committee challenged the basis of the assessment, and it was found that, because the previous agreement had been made under a previous version of the EU treaties that was not specifically provided for in the 2011 Act, it did not fall within the exemption set out in the Act. That is the principle on which the Government will operate.</p>

	<p pid="a.50.2/1">I am extremely grateful for that clarification. The Act clearly refers to article 352, so would it be fair for the House to assume that if it is not specifically under article 352, the exemptions will not apply?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-04a.50.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="50"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0002.htm#13020412000747">
	<p pid="a.50.3/1">It is fair for the House to assume that were it equivalently done on the basis of previous treaties, the precedent set by the decision would apply, but I would hesitate, off the top of my head, to take that any further.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/2">I turn now to the detail, starting with the electronic version of the Official Journal of the European Union. The Official Journal is the gazette of record for the EU. It is published every working day and records the decisions made and legislative acts of the EU institutions. The electronic version of the Official Journal has existed in parallel with the print version for some years, but a European Court of Justice judgment found that only the printed version was authentic. EU legislation is necessary, therefore, to enable the electronic version to have legal effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/3">The EU institutions believe that if publication of the electronic version is given legal effect, access to EU law would be faster and more economical. At the moment, anyone wishing to access the authentic version must order and pay for printed copies of the Official Journal. This proposal will not affect those who wish to continue to have access to the printed version. This is a sensible measure in a world in which electronic communications have revolutionised how information is distributed and accessed. It will have no significant impacts or effects on the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/4">The second proposal for which the Bill seeks to provide approval is the work programme of the Fundamental Rights Agency, established in 2007. Its role is to support the European institutions and member states&#8212;when</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/5">they are acting within the scope of EU law&#8212;to take measures and actions that respect fundamental rights. The agency does this through the collection and analysis of information and data. It also has a role in communicating about and raising awareness of fundamental rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/6">The agency&#8217;s work is regulated by a five-year work programme setting out the thematic areas of the agency&#8217;s activity. These must include the fight against racism, xenophobia and related intolerance and be in line with the European Union&#8217;s current priorities. The work programme, defined by the Council of Ministers, gives the member states control over where the agency undertakes its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/7">The agency&#8217;s first work programme covered the period 2007-12. In December 2011, the Commission brought forward a proposal for a new work programme to cover the period 2013-17. The proposal was amended through negotiations. The measure for which approval is sought very much continues the themes set out in the previous work programme, although there are some adjustments in the terminology.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/8">The agreement of a new work programme will not alter the tasks of the agency, and nor will it change the agency&#8217;s role or remit. The work programme does not set out or define these elements. Those are set out in a completely different instrument&#8212;the agency&#8217;s establishing regulation&#8212;and that instrument is not under review at this time. The work programme simply sets out the themes under which the agency will work. Failure to agree the work programme will deprive the Council of the opportunity to set the direction for the agency by defining these themes.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/9">I turn now to the third element in the Bill: the draft decision to maintain the number of EU commissioners at the equivalent of one per member state. The proposed reduction in the size of the Commission and the subsequent loss of a guaranteed commissioner emerged as a concern of the Irish during the ratification of the Lisbon treaty. In order to secure Ireland&#8217;s ratification of the treaty, it was agreed that a decision would be taken to maintain the number of EU commissioners before the appointment of the next Commission in 2014. The European Council has put forward the draft decision to fulfil the commitment made to Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/10">This Government are committed to creating a leaner, less bureaucratic European Union and to improving efficiency in the EU institutions, including the Commission. We believe there is significant room for savings in administration and will continue to push for substantial reductions in the EU&#8217;s administrative costs. However, it is also important that the UK maintains its EU commissioner. By agreeing to this draft decision, the UK will retain its guaranteed commissioner and be in a stronger position to influence the make-up of the next Commission. Furthermore, the draft decision states that it should be reviewed before a new Commission is appointed, in 2019, or when the number of EU member states reaches 30, whichever is earlier. The draft decision does not give the go-ahead for the Commission to continue expanding ad infinitum.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/11">I hope the House will agree with our assessment that these measures, although necessary, are administrative in nature, improving the accessibility and legal certainty</p>
	<p pid="a.50.3/12">of the EU&#8217;s official record, providing an EU agency with a work programme and fulfilling a commitment to the Irish people.</p>

	<p pid="a.52.1/1">My understanding is that there will be no alteration to the accessibility of the printed version.

	<p pid="a.52.2/1">In the order of things, many hon. Members might think that this Bill is not particularly contentious. I can understand that; however, the Bill is important, in terms of policy content and its constitutional significance to our relationship with the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/2">As we have heard, there are three elements to the Bill. The first gives legislative approval to the electronic version of the European Union&#8217;s Official Journal. A draft decision was arrived at by the Justice and Home Affairs Council last March. Parliament is now being asked to approve that decision. The second issue concerns another decision of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, about the European Union&#8217;s Fundamental Rights Agency. The European Union is required to make a decision to establish the thematic areas of the FRA&#8217;s work for the next five years. Political agreement was secured at the Council meeting in January last year. Now Parliament has to approve or reject that agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/3">Thirdly, there is the draft European Council decision on the number of European commissioners. The Lisbon treaty states that there will be one commissioner per member state until <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-01">1 November 2014</phrase>, when the number of commissioners would be reduced to a number corresponding to two thirds of the member states. However, a concession was made to assuage Irish sentiments during the Irish referendum on the Lisbon treaty. The concession was that each member state would continue to have one commissioner. To enable that commitment to come into effect, it is necessary to have the conclusion of the European Council agreed by this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/4">The three draft decisions are the first such decisions to be brought before this House under the European Union Act 2011. I would like to make a few remarks about that legislation. We welcome the fact that the agreement of Parliament is being sought on these decisions. Although we had reservations during the passage of the 2011 Act about the possibility of referendums being held on a multiplicity of relatively small issues, we strongly supported referendums being held on issues of constitutional significance. We also strongly supported a bigger role for Parliament, both in scrutinising European legislation and actual decision making. That is why we did not oppose the European Union Bill or divide the House on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/5">In a constitutional sense, the decisions before us are important because two of the three were made at European level under article 352 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union&#8212;the so-called flexibility clause&#8212;which allows the EU to act on a subject for which there is no specific treaty base. The clause has understandably been a cause for concern among parliamentarians across the political spectrum, not only in this country. Indeed, I recall that, when I was a member of the European Scrutiny Committee, a great deal of time was spent deliberating on the issue, and a good report was produced on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/6">Given that the Government support the two decisions made under article 352, I am pleased that we are having a full discussion on the Floor of the House and that parliamentary approval is being sought for a parliamentary Bill. I am especially pleased that such approval is being sought on the decision to extend the work of the Fundamental Rights Agency over the next five years. I say that because, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> has pointed out, the former Lord Chancellor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" name="Kenneth Clarke">the right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke)</phrase>, initially took the view that there was no need for an Act of Parliament as the European decisions satisfied the exemption requirements of the 2011 EU Act. I am pleased to note that the Government changed their mind on that after the European Scrutiny Committee and its indomitable Chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase>, pointed out the error of their ways.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/7">I shall comment briefly on each of the draft decisions covered by the Bill. The first decision relates to the Official Journal of the European Union. The EU has produced the OJ in printed form since 1958, and it has been available in its electronic format since 1998. The journal is made up of two series and one supplement. It contains information about the treaties and about the judgments of the European Court of Justice. Crucially, its &#8220;S series&#8221; supplement also provides invitations to tender for contracts and is therefore an important part of the mechanism that enables the single market to function and develop. As we all know, the single market is vital to the British economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/8">We also need to take into account a relatively recent court ruling to ensure that online electronic versions of the Official Journal of the European Union have parity with the paper versions. I refer Members to case C-161/06, which involved a company called Skoma-Lux in the Czech Republic. After being fined for infringing customs legislation, the company, which operated in the fine wine import sector, brought an action for the cancellation of the fine before the regional court in Ostrava. I am sure that Members will be fascinated to hear that the claimant was an importer of the red dessert wine, Kagor VK, into the Czech Republic. The wine was made from grape juice, with added sugar and corn spirit &#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> You have obviously not tried that delicacy yet, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I am sure that there is time to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/9">After the deliberations in the regional court, the matter was referred to the European Court of Justice, particularly in relation to the interpretation of article 58 of the 2003 Act of Accession, regarding whether that provision allowed the enforcement of a Community regulation that had not been published in the Official Journal of the European Unionin the language of a</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/10">member state. The Court went on to state that publication on the internet did not equate to proper publication. That is why we need clarification of that point today. In case there is concern about digitalisation, I am assured that it will be covered under heading 5 of a multi-annual financial framework budget allocation and that, as the Minister said, there will be no extra cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/11">The second draft decision relates to the Fundamental Rights Agency. The previous multi-annual framework for the FRA expired at the end of last year. After consultation, the European Council proposed extending and developing the FRA&#8217;s work in a number of thematic areas. In May last year, the Justice and Home Affairs Council reached political agreement for there to be nine areas of work. These included access to justice, victims of crime and compensation for crime victims, children&#8217;s rights, racism, xenophobia and related intolerance. Opposition Members believe that the agency is extremely useful in assessing the impact of legislation not only in current EU member states, but in applicant countries. We therefore support the draft decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/12">The third decision relates to the number of EU commissioners. This is perhaps the most significant of the proposals in the Bill. As I indicated a few moments ago, this draft decision maintains the number of commissioners at one per member state. I of course welcome the fact that the people of Ireland voted yes in 2009, and I am pleased that they felt able to do so. This change will, it has to be said, ensure that all member states will feel that they are fully represented in all the EU&#8217;s principal institutions, which can only be a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/13">It would be wrong to give the impression, however, that there is no need to change the way in which the Commission functions. There is a need and a case for examining whether there should be a degree of seniority within the college of commissioners, and a case can be made for examining the allocation of portfolios within the Commission. As the shadow Foreign Secretary has argued, there needs to be a commissioner with the specific responsibility for stimulating growth and job creation.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/14">Finally, in recent debates on the European Union, Members have referred to the need for national Parliaments to have a stronger voice and a stronger involvement. Despite its shortcomings, the European Union Act 2011 does to some extent address this issue, but let us not forget that one of the most positive aspects of the Lisbon treaty, which Labour secured, was the introduction of a so-called yellow card procedure. This needs to be strengthened so that this Parliament, along with other national Parliaments, really does fulfil a central role in EU decision making. Subsidiarity means that decisions ought to be taken at the most appropriate level&#8212;as close to the people as possible. That is a sound democratic principle, and it ought to be the cornerstone of how we approach the European Union. To make that vision a reality, it will be necessary to ensure that national Parliaments&#8212;and this Parliament in particular&#8212;play a central role in determining what should be decided and at what level of government.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.2/15">This Bill, small though it is, has our support because it modestly points us in the right direction. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of other more important aspects of the Government&#8217;s policy towards the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak on a matter European where there is general agreement across the House and no time limit on the scoreboard. I shall go on for only a couple of hours, and I have already issued my press release saying I was &#8220;speaking to a packed Chamber.&#8221; As long as the few Members here keep quiet about it, I shall be fine.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/2">I thought it might be wise to explain why it is important to discuss these matters. Because the European Union Act 2011 has brought today&#8217;s debate forward on the basis that Parliament is required to pass an Act to approve the relatively low-level EU decisions in clause 1, it might make it look as though those decisions are of no consequence and do not need to be talked about. As both the Minister and the shadow Minister said, however, these are quite important matters, and some other member states find them amazingly important.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/3">The German Federal Constitutional Court talked about article 352 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union&#8212;the flexibility clause that has caused so much excitement in the past&#8212;on which these proposed decisions are based. It considered that article as part of its 2009 judgment on the constitutionality of German basic law and the Lisbon treaty when Germany was seeking to ratify the treaty. Specifically, it considered the question of whether the article, which gives the European Union sweeping legislative power, was compatible with democracy as enshrined within German basic law.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/4">The court had already found that, to have democratic legitimacy, the powers of the EU must be rooted in a democratic decision of Germany&#8217;s national Parliament to confer those powers to the EU. The German court said:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/5">&#8220;Article 352 TFEU not only establishes a competence of action for the European Union but at the same time relaxes the principle of conferral.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/6">That is the principle that powers must be conferred on the EU by member states under article 352. The court continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/7">&#8220;action by the European Union in fields set out in the Treaties is intended to be possible if the Treaties have not provided the specific competence necessary&#8230;The provision can thus serve to create a competence which makes action on the European level possible in almost the entire area of application of the primary law&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/8">across the EU treaties.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/9">The court ruled that</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/10">&#8220;As regards the ban on transferring blanket empowerments or transferring Kompetenz&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/11">the competence for the EU to decide its own powers&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/12">&#8220;the provision&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/13">that is, article 352&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/14">&#8220;meets with constitutional objections because the newly worded provision makes it possible to substantially amend Treaty foundations of the European Union without the mandatory participation of legislative&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/15">national&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/16">&#8220;bodies beyond the Member States&#8217; executive powers&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/17">Essentially, the court said that the German Parliament would have to examine these matters again.</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/18">It is good that we are at least mimicking the German Parliament, albeit a few years later. We are here to discuss relatively important issues, as has the German</p>
	<p pid="a.55.0/19">Parliament. It could perhaps be argued that the German public may be a tiny tad less Eurosceptic, because their Parliament talks about these matters sensibly and regularly, and that they therefore may understand them slightly better.</p>

	<p pid="a.56.3/2">The Bill has been produced as a result of the requirement of the excellent European Union Act 2011 to approve the three EU decisions that have already been mentioned. Under the Act, before a United Kingdom Minister can give final agreement in the Council of the European Union or the European Council to decisions proposed on the basis of the EU treaties being used in these cases, the proposed decisions must be approved by an Act of Parliament. That is what we are doing today. Although certain proposals based on the EU flexibility clause are exempt from the requirement for an approving Act of Parliament, those exemptions do not apply in these cases. I will happily go into the details if Members want to know what they are. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40094" name="Nick Smith">The hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith)</phrase> is obviously keen to discuss them; perhaps we will do so afterwards, over a beer.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/3">Under the EU treaties, EU decisions of this kind require unanimity in the Council or the European Council, which means that without the UK&#8217;s support they cannot be adopted, at least to cover all member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/4">Members have already listed what the proposals would achieve. There is an EU regulation enabling the electronic rather than the printed version of the Official Journal to take EU legal effect. There is an EU decision that would set out the broad areas of work of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights between 2013 and 2017. There is also an EU decision on the number of European commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/5">Although the first two proposals may not seem to be hugely important, they are based on the flexibility clause, which gives the EU sweeping powers to adopt laws when the treaties have not otherwise given it the power to legislate. It has been used to adopt significant EU measures in the past, such as the creation of the EU bail-out fund for non-eurozone member states. It was therefore thought to warrant parliamentary control, and that thoroughly good idea was introduced by the European Union Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/6">The two proposals dealt with by clause 1 are being introduced under the flexibility clause: they are article 352 decisions&#8212;flexibility decisions. As I said, the flexibility clause has been used to co-ordinate national social security systems for the benefit of all member states&#8217; nationals when moving within the EU; to provide for</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/7">measures against the counterfeiting of euro coins that apply to member states outside the euro; and for the bail-out fund. We are talking about significant measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.56.3/8">The Bill deals with the EU Official Journal, which is not exactly the most exciting document in the world but, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40137" name="Wayne David">the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)</phrase> said, it contains striking elements of importance to the functioning of the single market, and to EU business and UK business in general. I have a small problem with it, because everything has to be translated into each of the official languages of the European Union. This is not a debate for now, but that approach means that everything that is said in the Official Journal has to be translated into, for example, Gaelic, and that is perhaps not the best use of money.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.0/1">I was recently at a European Union conference where the Irish did speak in Gaelic, and I applaud them for doing so. The great linguistic creations of humankind should be preserved, and I am glad that the Irish are speaking in their own language and insisting that it be translated.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.1/1">I completely understand the cultural point that the hon. Gentleman makes, but the European Central Bank uses only a couple of languages and many international institutions manage to cut down the number of languages they use, and they do so purely to keep costs down. The European Commission, the European Parliament and other European institutions do not do that and perhaps they should examine their approach. I merely wanted to make that point in relation to how difficult it is to produce the Official Journal for the very next day in written and electronic form. The Government have given political&#8212;not legally binding&#8212;agreement to the proposed regulation, with the Council supposedly ready to adopt it and the European Parliament having given its consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/2">The Bill also deals with the proposed EU decision establishing a multi-annual work programme to cover 2013-17 for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. Again, one can give a parting shot, at least, about the growth in the number of these EU agencies; there is a huge number now and, as with commissioners, one at least has to go to each member state. In 2007, the EU adopted a regulation, based on the flexibility clause, establishing the agency, which is based in Vienna. Its objective has been outlined by the hon. Gentleman, but according to article 2 of its founding regulations it is to provide &#8220;assistance and expertise&#8221; to support member states in fully respecting fundamental rights. Under article 4 of its founding regulations, the agency&#8217;s activities include: gathering, analysing and disseminating information; publishing reports; and developing &#8220;a communication strategy&#8221; and a</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/3">&#8220;dialogue with civil society, in order to raise public awareness of fundamental rights&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/4">In 2013, the agency will receive a subsidy of &#8364;21.3 million from the EU budget, about half of which will be spent on staffing. According to article 5 of the agency&#8217;s founding regulation, the Council needs to adopt five-year multi-annual frameworks that set out</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/5">&#8220;thematic areas of the Agency&#8217;s activity, which must include the fight against racism, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/6">In addition to the multi-annual framework, the agency can respond to requests from the Council, the European Parliament or European Commission for it to conduct studies or produce conclusions on particular topics.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/7">The draft Council decision before Parliament is the proposed multi-annual framework for the four years between 2013 and 2017, proposed by the European Commission on the basis of the flexibility clause. Under that decision, the thematic areas of the agency&#8217;s work in that time period will be: access to justice; victims of crime, including compensation for victims of crime; the information society, particularly respect for private life and the protection of personal data; Roma integration; judicial co-operation, except in criminal matters; the rights of the child; discrimination based on sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, language, religion or belief, political or other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation; immigration and the integration of migrants, visa and border control and asylum; and racism, xenophobia and related intolerance. The Government have given political but not legally binding agreement to the proposed decision. The Council is apparently ready to adopt the proposal and the European Parliament has already given its consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/8">That leaves us with the final measure, which is probably more controversial than was originally said: the retention of one European commissioner per member state under clause 2. The European Commission consists of one national of each member state, so there are 27 commissioners and there will soon be 28 when Croatia comes in. Following great debate in the European Parliament and many other EU institutions and in the Parliaments of many member states, the treaty of Lisbon introduced the ratio of two thirds commissioners to member states. The logic was quite sensible: it was an attempt to stop bureaucracy growing out of control and to maintain some easier management of the bureaucracy from the top. The member states whose nationals would be commissioners would be decided</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/9">&#8220;on the basis of a system of strictly equal rotation between the Member States, reflecting the demographic and geographical range of all the Member States&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/10">The system would be agreed by unanimous decision at the European Council and each commissioner&#8217;s term would be five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/11">Article 17(5) of the treaty on European Union states that the European Council, acting unanimously, can vary the size of the Commission from November 2014. As the Government&#8217;s explanatory notes to the Bill state in paragraph 12,</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/12">&#8220;when the Irish people voted &#8216;no&#8217; in a referendum on Lisbon Treaty ratification in June 2008 the loss of a guaranteed&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/13">Irish commissioner in every Commission</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/14">&#8220;emerged as a key concern. Without Irish ratification the Treaty could not enter into force, and as a result EU Heads of State and Government offered concessions to Ireland&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/15">One of the main concessions, offered in December 2008 and reiterated in June 2009, provided that when</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/16">&#8220;the Lisbon Treaty entered into force, a decision would be taken&#8230;to the effect that the Commission shall continue to include one national of each Member State&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/17">Those concessions seemed enough for the Irish people, who voted in the second referendum in October 2009 and approved that treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/18">The draft European Council decision based on article 17(5) has now been introduced and provides that from November 2014 onwards the number of commissioners will continue to equal the number of member states. The draft decision states that it will be reviewed in advance of the appointment of the Commission due to take office in 2019, but for the decision to be altered there will need to be unanimity in the European Council, meaning that any member state can veto such a change. Having a European commissioner is a big deal for many, if not all, of the countries of the European Union, so it is highly unlikely that the change will ever be made. We will therefore continue to build on the number of European Commissioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.59.0/1">Does that mean that every European Commissioner will need a department to be built to support them or will there be commissioners without portfolio?</p>

	<p pid="a.59.1/1">I shall address that point in a moment, but yes, no commissioner is merely in charge of paper clips. Every commissioner needs a cabinet&#8212;a group of people around them from the top of the civil service&#8212;and normally brings an extra language with them, so a huge amount of cost and bureaucracy is associated with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/2">The Government have given political but not legally binding agreement to the proposed decision, which is scheduled to be formally adopted by the European Council some time this year. Agreeing with the decision sits slightly oddly with something that the Prime Minister said in his speech on EU policy last week under the theme of competitiveness:</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/3">&#8220;Can we justify a Commission that gets ever larger?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/4">That is a fair question, considering that many other European bodies&#8212;the European Court of Auditors, for example&#8212;have an appointee from each member state, and work by having so many cooks making this particular broth. Appointments to EU agencies, as I have said, seem to be farmed out nearly one per member state, and it has almost got to the point where we need to have a serious discussion about how, if the European Commission is to work effectively, that can be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/5">It is a particularly thorny issue, and warrants much more discussion. It is amazingly political. As I have said, it was one of the more important assurances gained by the Irish to secure a yes vote in their referendum. Everyone in Parliament will remember that the UK, along with four other large countries, had two commissioners, but we gave up our second commissioner with the enlargement of the EU in 2004. It is de rigueur in the EU for each country that comes into the club to get a commissioner&#8212;a seat at the main decision-making table in Europe. While that is a fine principle, it brings with it, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> suggested, some powers to guide and oversee, but also a mass of bureaucracy. I believe that that is one reason why my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister raised that question in his excellent speech at Bloomberg the other week.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/6">One does not have to be pro-European or Eurosceptic to see that the European Commission has become unwieldy in size, and while this might not be the time to sort out</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/7">the issue for good, it would be a good opportunity to raise this thorny issue for discussion with our European counterparts. With many new accessions down the line, it seems that this is an opportunity missed. Certainly, it would be an interesting discussion to have at roughly the same time that the multi-annual financial framework is decided. I wonder, if we had a reasonable debate on the subject, whether proposals at least to trim the Commission&#8217;s total budget for the next seven years could be achieved, even if it is not possible to trim or cap the number of commissioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.1/8">I conclude where I began. It is really good to see some proper scrutiny as a result of the European Union Act 2011. I thank the Government for introducing that excellent piece of legislation and for sticking to both the letter and the spirit of it.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.0/1">First, I apologise for not being here for the Front-Bench speeches. I was detained elsewhere, and I assure fellow Members that I shall not speak for long.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/2">However, I have been provoked into speaking by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40198" name="Chris Heaton-Harris">the hon. Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris)</phrase>, with whom I frequently agree on European matters, but on this one I disagree. It is very important indeed to retain one member of the Commission for every member state, and I see a parallel in the American Senate, where states, however large or small, have two senators. If New York, California and Texas began to get together to say, &#8220;Well, Delaware and Rhode Island will no longer have senators,&#8221; there would be all sorts of problems. I am sure that there are other ways of overcoming the problems of inefficiency&#8212;perhaps with departmental arrangements for more than one commissioner in Departments that are particularly big, as we do in our own Government: we have more than one Minister per Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/3">Proportionality exists with qualified majority voting, and on many voting issues, different countries have different weights. It is important that, at the highest level, every individual country has their say, just as in the American constitution, every state, however small, has a say at the top table. It is important, too, to have the occasional bit of grit in the oyster. Small states, as well as large states, can occasionally become disagreeable, and I think that being disagreeable is part of the essence of democracy. Having a machine dominated by bureaucracy and officials who just go along with it is not healthy for democracy. I have many criticisms of the European Union, and I have been very critical of the secrecy with which the Commission operates. I hope we will always preserve a single member per state as the method of composition of the Commission, even if we make some different arrangements for how it works.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/4">Another factor in all this is who the commissioners are. I like to think that from time to time we as the British people might appoint a commissioner whose first loyalty is to the interests of British people, and who reflects their views as well as their interests. Their views may sometimes be awkward and may certainly be grit in the European oyster. That would be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/5">Once the commissioners are appointed, which portfolio is allocated to which member state? I have been told by certain MEPs that from time to time conclaves of Commission officials get together to allocate dodgy</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/6">portfolios, in particular the portfolio of Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, to weaker members. I know that there is always the worry that a commissioner might turn out to be a bit of a trade unionist, a bit of a leftist. That would be very dangerous. We must have someone who knows that the market and employers come first. Above all, we must make sure that profits come first, not the interests of working people.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.0/7">Who is appointed as a commissioner for each member state and which portfolio they are given are very important matters. I hope we will see to it that at least Britain has commissioners for the foreseeable future&#8212;for as long as we are in the European Union&#8212;who truly represent the views of the British people, and not just the interests of the British people as they see them. I hope also that we get appropriate portfolios, and that the small countries that might be squeezed out also have their say.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.0/1">It is great to see the European Union Act 2011 in action. It has certainly drawn in the crowds today, in just the way that we might have warned that it might not do when we discussed the Bill. During its passage through Parliament, we warned that the Bill might represent a slightly disproportionate response to concerns about scrutiny and democracy in relation to European affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.0/2">The fact that we have ended up spending parliamentary time on the Floor of the House discussing the publication in electronic format of the European Parliament record suggests that we might have had a point. I remember Ministers optimistically assuming that a debate such as this might assuage the Eurosceptic concerns about democracy and scrutiny in relation to Europe. I thought at the time that that might be optimistic.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.4/3">more substantial debate, as it adjusts a mechanism that was supposed to limit the size and endless growth of the Commission. There are a number of issues that that growth has raised. It was not simply the practicality of having an ever-increasing number of commissioners. Without being unkind to some of the smaller member states, we know that there is a bit of a capacity issue in terms of their ability to produce candidates of sufficient calibre for a portfolio that affects the entire continent. Moreover, in terms of public perception, it slightly muddies the whole idea of the Commission. The Commission should be, in essence, the equivalent of our civil service. It should be the servant of the Council of Ministers, the various European ministerial councils and the European Parliament, and not pretend to be a representative body.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.1/1">I do not often agree with the hon. Gentleman on matters European, but I do agree that there is a slight risk of that happening, as we have all been aware over many decades. We have to be careful about the level of democratic accountability in the European Union. I would always support increasing democratic reform and democratic accountability in the EU where we can do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.1/2">There is the potential for endless growth in the number of commissioners, or at least for the number to be limited only by the number of European states that might join the EU. It was clear from the Irish referendum debate that, as any fan of the TV series &#8220;Borgen&#8221; will know, for smaller countries the appointment of a European commissioner is a major political issue to which people attach a great deal of importance, and we have to respect that.

In the spirit of coalition unity, I recognise that the European Union Act 2011 has brought a greater level of accountability and scrutiny to European legislation in this place, and that process could go further. At the beginning of last year, Ministers announced that there would be a review of the way in which scrutiny of European legislation took place. Submissions were invited, and I found myself in rare agreement with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon.

However, I suggest that we might in time reflect on whether it is a good use of parliamentary time to spend time in the main Chamber dealing with issues that are relatively uncontentious and, in many cases, relatively unimportant in the great scheme of things. With that major caveat, I am happy to give my support to the Bill.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40163" name="Martin Horwood">the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase>, with whom I disagree on almost every matter regarding Europe, this being no exception. I think it is fantastic that we are spending parliamentary time scrutinising what is being done in the European Union. So many laws come to our nation from the European Union practically rubber-stamped as an appendix to a report put out by the European Scrutiny Committee that is not even debated in a Committee upstairs. The percentage that we send through for debate in Committee is small, and that which comes to the Floor of the House smaller still.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.1/2">Article 352 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union allows the European Union very widespread powers to extend its abilities to legislate across its areas of competence, and it is important for us to scrutinise and control that.</p>

I would argue that everybody who voted at the last election wants to sleep securely in their beds knowing that the law is fairly and properly made.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.0/1">It might not be of much importance that the electronic publication of the Official Journal goes ahead, but I put it to my hon. Friend that it is pretty important how many commissioners are appointed, because that has a direct spin-off in cost terms.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.1/1">There are two parts to my hon. Friend&#8217;s point. On the first part, I disagree with him. The form in which instructions are sent out is important, and it is right that people should know about it. It is a long-standing principle of our law that ignorance of the law is no excuse. If that is fair, it is also fair that knowledge of the law should be made available to people in a timely and efficient way, because it is something that might affect their lives, and that when a change to the method of notification takes place, that should be debated in this Chamber and passed into law. On the second part, I completely agree that the number of commissioners is significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/2">The second point that I raised with my right hon. Friend the Minister is crucially important. It relates to the change from article 308 of the previous treaty to article 352 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Article 352 is broader in scope. Had it been assumed that anything previously incorporated under article 308 could be transmuted under article 352, that could have allowed all sorts of laws&#8212;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40198" name="Chris Heaton-Harris">the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris)</phrase> went through a number of them&#8212;to pass into the body of European Union powers without any further scrutiny by this House. As is often the case, something that is in itself minor has set an important precedent in protecting the rights of this House to scrutinise these matters and to ensure that the interests of our constituents are protected.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.1/3">I wish briefly to discuss the number of commissioners. I do not have the confidence that some hon. Members have in our commissioners, and I do not feel happy that we have one representing us. Commissioners take an oath that they will act in the best interests of the European Union. Some have argued that that is directly contrary to the oath that they have taken as Privy Counsellors, and we should be concerned about that. They are there, by design, to represent the interests of Europe, not of the United Kingdom. Perhaps because of our history and our civic traditions, our commissioners tend to take that very seriously, whereas commissioners from some other countries may simply represent the nation state that has sent them. I do not have great confidence that the person representing the United Kingdom is waving the Union Jack; they could just as well be waving that awful European Union flag.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way yet again. I am one of those who have been concerned for many years about our commissioners, not just because they do not represent my view, but because I do not think they represent the collective view of our people, if there is such a thing. One possibility might be for them to be elected. We have started to elect police commissioners, but European commissioners are much more important.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.3/1">That is a brilliant idea. If they were elected, there would be less chance of them going native, because they might be able to stand for election</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/2">again. At present, there is a fear that, when people go off to Europe, the moment they arrive they send out for Belgian dress so that they can appear to fit in with the ethos of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/3">I want to address the question of Ireland and the specifics of what it was given to persuade it&#8212;bully it, perhaps&#8212;to ratify the Lisbon treaty. That shows&#8212;I think that this strengthens the Prime Minister&#8217;s renegotiation position&#8212;that countries can renegotiate with the EU for things that they feel they need when discussions are being held in the European Councils. That is an important point. We have often heard people say, &#8220;The Prime Minister can go off to Europe, but they will not give him anything. It&#8217;s too bad: you&#8217;ve just got to like it or lump it.&#8221; Actually, the European Union, for all its many faults, is a fundamentally pragmatic body in how it gets agreement among member states. It does a lot of horse trading, one way or another, to get agreements. I do not know whether <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40668" name="Emma Reynolds">the hon. Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds)</phrase> wants to intervene, but she seems to be nodding vaguely in response to that particular point.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/4">The situation means that, if we go to the EU and say, &#8220;If you want X, you must give us Y,&#8221; or, &#8220;If you want X, you must give us A to Z in return,&#8221; that is a strong position for us to be in when the requirement is for unanimity. What Ireland has done, and what we are bringing into law, is very important and very encouraging for the United Kingdom and for the position of my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in his negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/5">Finally, I praise the Government for the Bill, which has been proposed as a consequence of the 2011 Act. When the Act was going through Parliament, it was not universally welcomed, certainly not by those on the Opposition Benches, but even Eurosceptics on my side were sceptical about the effect that it would have. I was extremely pleased to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40137" name="Wayne David">the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)</phrase> welcome the Bill and I am pleased that the Government have changed their view so that the multi-annual financial framework has to go through British law. That shows that the 2011 Act is working and acting as a proper check on what goes on in the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.64.3/6">Without the Act, none of the three things under discussion today would have required legislation, but, because of it, they all do. As a result, crucial issues, such as the future number of European commissioners and renegotiations such as that which took place with Ireland to get it to support the Lisbon treaty, have come before this Chamber. Although in this instance the Bill has turned out to be uncontroversial, it could have been very controversial. I think that we are now secure, thanks to the Government, in having a better check on the accretion of powers to Europe. I might like to reverse them, but at least we are now checking them.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.0/1">I first want to refer, in the context of the Bill, to the referendum announced by the Prime Minister. We have heard much about the 2011 Act. I opposed it during many of its stages, because I believed that although it had a so-called referendum lock, in practice it would not deal with the kinds of things we are now besieged with, particularly those measures that are being introduced into the political</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/2">core of Europe&#8212;the eurozone&#8212;that affect the United Kingdom but that, because they do not refer to the United Kingdom, do not require a referendum, however significant their impact on the United Kingdom. In fact, the European Scrutiny Committee, which I have the honour to chair, produced a report on that very question and we remain extremely concerned about the effect of allowing legislation to go through without a referendum on the specious grounds that a transfer of powers is not taking place. This is not just about a transfer of powers; a referendum is required when there is a fundamental change.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.0/3">Interestingly, the referendum announced by the Prime Minister, which I think should take place during this Parliament, is a very good example&#8212;indeed, it is a perfect example&#8212;of something that does not fall under the 2011 Act. However, it is the opinion of the Prime Minister&#8212;it is certainly my opinion and that of many hon. Members present&#8212;that the proposals that are about to be announced, or that he thinks are likely to be announced, as well as what has already been transferred, the structure of the treaties and the impact of the provisions, past and present, on the United Kingdom, should be subject to a referendum, because of the unfortunate, aggregate effect that they continue to have on the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="a.66.5/1">That is true, but I maintain that the key question is whether the requirements contained in the five principles, which include repatriation and the primacy of national Parliaments&#8212;on which the European Scrutiny Committee has insisted on a three-hour debate on the Floor of the House because of the implications for economic governance&#8212;are all part and parcel of what has been going wrong in the European Union.

	<p pid="a.67.1/1">Not long enough, says my hon. Friend. The fact is that article 308 is and always has been a very contentious issue. It is reflected in provisions in our own domestic law that deal with whether or not, when something is enacted, anything that flows from it can be done without the need for further primary legislation. It so happens that article 352 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union has similar words:</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/2">&#8220;If action by the Union should prove necessary, within the framework of the policies defined in the Treaties, to attain one of the objectives set out in the Treaties, and the Treaties have not provided the necessary powers, the Council, acting unanimously&#8230;after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament, shall adopt the appropriate measures.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/3">That means that there is already a big amber light in relation to the acquisition of these further powers, although there is no legal base for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.1/4">That is, in a nutshell, the reason for the Bill. Sections 7 and 8 of the 2011 Act do not apply to the two draft decisions that were made under article 352. An Act of Parliament is therefore required. That is a safeguard. My hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset is right that it is important that we have an Act of Parliament, despite what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40163" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> said, not because of the nature of the provision in question, but because the 2011 Act, which the hon.

	<p pid="a.67.5/1">I do not want to be drawn too far down that route, but the simple reason for primary legislation is that, without it, there would not be adequate legislative authority, even for the questions that arise under this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/2">I shall now turn to one or two issues relating to the Bill that required a considerable amount of consideration by the European Scrutiny Committee. I will give a tiny bit of history on the multi-annual framework for the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, but I will try to be as brief as possible. The Justice Minister, Lord McNally, stated in an explanatory memorandum that was issued to the House and the European Scrutiny Committee in January 2012 that he thought that the proposal was justified. He said that the Government would have opposed the proposal to extend the multi-annual framework, but wanted to consider whether the technical issues that they disliked had been addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/3">The European Scrutiny Committee reported on the proposal on <phrase class="date" code="2012-02-01">1 February 2012</phrase>. We asked the Government whether they accepted the view of the European Commission that</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/4">&#8220;with the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, the Agency&#8217;s remit automatically extends, in principle, to all areas of EU competence under the TFEU, and that the Agency may therefore undertake activities within the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters without any further amendment to its founding Regulation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/5">We questioned the Government&#8217;s view that this decision satisfied the exemption requirements under section 8(6)(a) of the 2011 Act and would not require an Act of Parliament. Our 10th report, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-17">17 July 2012</phrase>, set out our concerns in greater detail. The draft decision remained under scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/6">The former Lord Chancellor, who is now the Minister without Portfolio, told the European Scrutiny Committee in July 2012 that a political agreement had been reached on the draft decision which excluded any new activity covering EU policing and criminal law measures. In a letter that he sent on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-22">22 November</phrase>, he told the European Scrutiny Committee that, having heard what we had said, the Government were now&#8212;although they had not been before&#8212;of the opinion that the exemption did not apply in this case, and that primary legislation would be introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/7">That is why we have this Bill&#8212;the European Scrutiny Committee did its job and asked for further clarification. <i>[Interruption.]</i> I am extremely grateful to the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40103" name="Mark Simmonds">the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase>, for nodding his head, because sometimes people wonder what all the detail is about and whether we have to be so intricate. The bottom line is that the European Scrutiny Committee, by pointing out the legal objections and having a dialogue with the Government, who in turn had a dialogue with the European Commission, helped to make the legislation better. We helped to guarantee that there would be primary legislation and that, in the absence of the authorisation through the 2011 Act that had been deemed to be appropriate, this House would have the opportunity to consider the matter in the way we are considering it today. Indeed, after this debate, there will be a Committee stage and a Report stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/8">The European Scrutiny Committee reported on the proposal again on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-28">28 November</phrase>. We cleared the document, but in January 2013 we pointed out to Ministers that the Government&#8217;s uncertainty about whether the exemptions applied to this decision had prevented the new measure from being agreed in good time. That is the history of this matter and it is important to put it on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/9">The draft decision on the number of European Commissioners provides another example of the European Scrutiny Committee takings its findings to the Government and, thereby, to the Commission. We received an explanatory memorandum and a letter from the Minister for Europe on <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-27">27 September</phrase>. He stated that the size and composition of the European Commission was a fraught subject. He went on to say that it was difficult to identify a solution that was equitable, legitimate in terms of the relative size and weight of different European countries, and efficient. That is all in our report.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/10">The European Scrutiny Committee considered the draft decision in its 13th report, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2012-11-02">2 November 2012</phrase>. We noted that because of delays in the draft decision being communicated to member states and because Parliament was in recess, it was not possible for us to scrutinise the proposal before political agreement needed to be reached on the draft decision at the General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-16">16 October 2012</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.5/11">I put that on the record because it is important that these matters have a proper legal base and that Parliament has an opportunity to debate them. We are having this debate on the Floor of the House, so it is open to any Member of Parliament to discuss these proposals, to oppose them, to examine them in Committee and to table amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.1/1">I will give way in just a moment, if I may.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/2">The problem is that when we provide for amendments to be made to matters that have been through the Council of Ministers, we are obliged under section 2 of the European Communities Act 1972 to continue to pass that legislation through our Parliament. That poses the very questions regarding the role of national Parliaments that the Prime Minister raised in his recent speech. The European Scrutiny Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into scrutiny and that is among the matters that we are considering.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/3">If the House of Commons&#8212;or indeed the House of Lords, although I will stick to the House of Commons for my purposes&#8212;were to take exception to a provision that was included in an Act of Parliament for lack of a legal base or for some other substantive reason and wanted to vote against it, that would raise the very question that was embedded in the White Paper of 1971, which led to the passing of the 1972 Act. Under section 2 of that Act, we must implement all decisions that have been decided in the Council of Ministers, irrespective of any other factors. Under section 3, we must agree to all decisions of the European Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/4">In the context of the Prime Minister&#8217;s speech&#8212; I welcome his comments on the referendum, although I think it will come too late&#8212;we have to evaluate where the power lies in passing legislation. We need an Act of Parliament for the provisions contained in the Bill for the reasons that have already been given, which I endorse. However, could Parliament veto the provisions that it covers if we did not want them to go through? We should be allowed to do so, and that will be part of the inquiry that the European Scrutiny Committee is now conducting. It is difficult to justify to the British people the fact that if they vote in a general election to have certain legislation implemented, they can then find that it is all decided in the Council of Ministers, where</p>
	<p pid="a.69.1/5">91.7% of votes go in favour of European proposals. That brings up the whole business of how UKRep advises, or even decides, on such legislation, which is a vital question that affects the daily lives of this country&#8217;s voters.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend&#8217;s Committee on bringing this matter before the House. Clause 2 of the Bill contains an important provision. How can it be right that a small country such as Luxembourg has equal representation on the Commission with a complex country such as ourselves? That surely makes no sense whatever. Furthermore, the clause seems to indicate that however many countries join the EU, they will each get a commissioner, so we could end up with 30 or more commissioners. How can that make sense?</p>

	<p pid="a.70.1/1">It is difficult to make sense of a lot of things that come out of the European Union, and I am reminded of what Alice said in &#8220;Alice&#8217;s Adventures in Wonderland&#8221; about believing half a dozen impossible things before breakfast every day. That is possibly one example.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/2">The reality is that there are 27 member states, and there was a lot of discussion about whether there should be an equivalent number of commissioners. It was decided that each member state would continue to have a commissioner. I understand well what my hon. Friend says, and it is quite difficult to justify given countries&#8217; comparative size, geography, GDP and so on. On the other hand, if some countries were to be denied a European commissioner, I suppose some people would say that they were being treated unfairly. Finally on the number of commissioners, I have argued in the past that the European Commission should be relegated to the role of a secretariat rather than the role that it currently enjoys.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.2/1">My hon. Friend has eloquently, and at some length, posed and answered the question that I was going to put to him earlier. I was going to say that whatever we do here, it will have no impact on the number of commissioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.3/1">That is correct, given that the veto that was promised to us has been taken away.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/2">Right at the beginning, when the European Communities Act 1972 went through, the functions of the European Union were fairly restricted. Up to the Single European Act in 1986, which I voted for, there were a limited number of qualified majority voting arrangements. That Act greatly expanded them, and I tabled an amendment at the time suggesting, &#8220;Nothing in this Act shall derogate from the sovereignty of the United Kingdom Parliament&#8221;. I was then advised by the Clerks&#8212;indeed, I went to the Speaker about it&#8212;that it was not possible to move such an amendment, because it would challenge the fabric of the 1972 Act. Time has moved on, and qualified majority voting is now used in a lot more cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/3">There was a qualification in the 1971 White Paper, which led to the passing of the 1972 Act by a mere six votes. It stated that there would be no essential erosion of British sovereignty, and that we would have to retain the veto in our vital national interest, because doing otherwise would undermine and endanger the very fabric</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/4">of the European Community itself. I repeated that point the other day and will do so again and again, for one reason&#8212;the mass of legislation that there has been since the referendum in 1975, including all the treaties, with some 35 million people in this country never having had an opportunity to express their view on that legislation. As I said in</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/5" class="italic">The Times</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/6">the other day, treaty after treaty has gone through on a three-line Whip, without a referendum. There has been a vast accumulation of qualified majority voting, and all that legislation has been passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/7">The Bill contains just one provision. Matters that would normally require a Bill have gone through both Houses of Parliament without one, but this one, which is based on a few lines in a directive or regulation, is in a Bill. There is a complete mismatch in proportionality in how we legislate.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.3/8">There may well be no Division this evening, but that does not alter the fact that we have done our job, both in the European Scrutiny Committee and in the House, by examining a matter that would otherwise not have had a legal base under article 352. It is dangerous to legislate without having the power to do so. The rule of law is essential to the running of a stable Government and a stable European Union&#8212;if there is to be a European Union, it had better be stable and in accordance with the rule of law. Increasingly, the EU is demonstrating its lack of regard for the rule of law on matters such as the stability and growth pact. We also see it in the unlawful manner in which 25 member states went ahead after the Prime Minister had exercised the veto. There are many other examples. When a body that vaunts the rule of law as much as the EU is blatantly in breach of its own rules, there is trouble ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase>, who does such sterling service to the House in his capacity as Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee. I think I am the first person to speak in this debate, apart from the Front Benchers, who is not a member of that Committee, and I pay tribute to its members, who have ensured that we have the opportunity to hold the Government and the European Union to account in tonight&#8217;s debate and on subsequent occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/2">I shall confine my remarks to the aspect of the Bill dealing with the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. You will remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, that when the Lisbon treaty was being discussed, our Government said that they were against the Fundamental Rights Agency because they thought it completely superfluous and unnecessary. They said that all it would do would be to duplicate the work of the Council of Europe. That is exactly what it has set out to do&#8212;to usurp the Council of Europe and duplicate its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/3">I am disappointed, given that the Government are newly playing hardball in Europe, that we are not taking on the agency and saying, &#8220;Hold on a minute, why are you expanding your ambit of activity? Why have you got a substantially increased budget?&#8221; My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40198" name="Chris Heaton-Harris">the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris)</phrase> referred in his excellent contribution to the</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/4">agency&#8217;s budget having risen to &#8364;21.3 million a year. Only a few years ago, it was hardly &#8364;100&#8212;it was a small, miniscule budget. A lot of that budget is being wasted, and I will give the House an example.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/5">About 18 months ago when I chaired the committee on migration, refugees and displaced persons at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, I was lucky enough to be invited by the Fundamental Rights Agency to address a conference in the centre of Warsaw. To my incredulity, I found that a whole 40-storey hotel in the centre of Warsaw was taken up with guests of the Fundamental Rights Agency who, on inquiry, had all had their expenses paid by that agency and had come from all over Europe, and beyond, to discuss issues relating to fundamental rights. That seemed an unnecessarily extravagant way of getting information&#8212;the Fundamental Rights Agency is to provide expert advice and support to European Union institutions and member states, not to give jollies to people from non-governmental organisations who want an outing to Warsaw at the expense of the European taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/6">When I read the brilliant research paper from the House of Commons Library and saw some of the background on how the Commission reached its conclusion, I was a little dubious. It states that on <phrase class="date" code="2013-12-13">13 December</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/7">&#8220;the Commission proposed a new Multiannual Framework&#8230;and consulted the Management Board of the Fundamental Rights Agency&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/8">In other words, it consulted the producer interests and received a preliminary contribution. The paper went on:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/9">&#8220;The Management Board consulted the Agency&#8217;s Fundamental Rights Platform (a network of cooperation with civil society)&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/10">I suspect that most of those in the hotel I described were members of the agency&#8217;s fundamental rights platform. Unsurprisingly&#8212;such people are used to receiving that sort of indulgence at the expense of the European taxpayer&#8212;they were in favour of expanding the ambit of the Fundamental Rights Agency, as set out in the revised multi-annual framework. What an extraordinary state of affairs. I am surprised that the Government have not played a harder ball on the issue, although I am sure we will have the chance to focus on it by tabling an amendment to delete that provision when we discuss the Bill in Committee or on Report.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/11">Whencommenting on the results of the consultation to which I have referred, the European Parliament stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/12">&#8220;One hundred and eight organisations took part in the consultation process. Most organisations support the Agency&#8217;s work in the current areas, and would like it to continue&#8230;particularly in the areas of&#8230;asylum and migration.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/13">There was a lot of support for extending the work of the Fundamental Rights Agency, and I am not surprised.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/14">If we must have such an agency, it would be better if it stopped duplicating the work of the Council of Europe. All members of the European Union are also members of the Council of Europe, but the Council of Europe&#8217;s budget is not going up because its European Union members say that we cannot afford to spend more money on it. The costs of the European Court of Human Rights continue to increase, but the Council of Europe&#8217;s budget is being squeezed in all other areas, including research. Meanwhile, such research is increasingly being done by the Fundamental Rights Agency with money that should rightfully be contributed to the Council of Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.71.0/15">In a sense, I am disappointed that the Government seem to go along with the expansion of the Fundamental Rights Agency. How does that fit with the policy of this Government and this Parliament of trying to reduce the size of the European Union budget? The challenge given to those of us who want a real-terms reduction in that budget is always: &#8220;What are you going to cut?&#8221; Well, expenditure on the Fundamental Rights Agency is one thing we could cut, and we could do it by cutting that agency&#8217;s wings in the multi-annual framework that started this January and continues for the next five years. If we had not agreed to the expansion of that framework and had instead insisted on it being reduced in scope, we would have secured real savings and contributed to the genuine reduction in the European Union budget that everybody&#8212;certainly on the Government Benches&#8212;wishes to see.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">I praise my hon. Friend for his work in establishing the budget of this new organisation. Since the Council of Europe gives the European taxpayer such good value for money in having its budget reduced each year, instead of having a new agency, why not give all its functions to the Council of Europe? In that way, we could reduce the European budget.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.1/1">I think that is a brilliant idea, and for a long time I thought that was the policy supported by the Government. It is certainly supported by almost every member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, including many from core European Union states who regard themselves as being Europhiles in the extreme, but even they ask what the point is of duplicating the functions of the Council of Europe with those of the Fundamental Rights Agency. I hope my hon. Friend will take that idea forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/2">If we are to have a Fundamental Rights Agency with a multi-annual framework, as stated in the Bill, why not concentrate on one or two areas with an obvious need for further work? At the moment, the management board mentions &#8220;thematic areas&#8221;, which include:</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/3">&#8220;Immigration and integration of migrants; visa and border control; asylum&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/4">and the European Union is fundamentally failing in that area at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/5">The week before last I was in Greece where I visited the Greece-Turkey border and received briefings from Greek Ministers and the Hellenic coastguard about the problem of illegal migrants coming into Greece, mainly from Turkey. One problem in Greece that contributes to the</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/6">&#8220;racism, xenophobia and related intolerance&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/7">that is thematic area (j)&#8212;is that it is virtually impossible for Greece to return illegal migrants to the countries from which they came.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/8">Let me give the House an example. When visiting a detention centre in Athens, I went up to the wire fence and asked whether anybody spoke English. To cut a long story short, I started a conversation with a person who said that he had arrived in the detention centre having set out from Afghanistan&#8212;he is an Afghan national&#8212;and that he had paid smugglers $8,000 to get across Iran and Turkey. He wanted to go from Turkey across the Aegean sea and on to the Italian eastern seaboard so that he could make his way to the United Kingdom. I inquired about that and asked why he wanted</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/9">to go to London. He replied that it was because he had been there for five years until a few months ago, and that he had lots of friends in London who had paid the $8,000 for his return trip. He had been deported from the United Kingdom after playing our system for about five years, and within a few weeks of getting back to Afghanistan this wholly undeserving case was presenting himself in a Greek detention centre.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/10">Unfortunately for that man, the boat from Turkey foundered&#8212;I suppose it is fortunate that the Greek coastguard rescued him and he was not drowned&#8212;and he found himself in the detention centre, but the Greek authorities had no way of returning him back to Afghanistan, because Afghanistan does not accept anyone in Greece who emanated from Afghanistan. If he is detained in Greece for the maximum of 18 months, he will be released and will join all those other people in Greece&#8212;this also happens in Italy&#8212;who do not belong or do not necessarily wish to stay there, which contributes to feelings of racism and xenophobia on the part of the indigenous population. Something like 60% of people in Greek prisons are non-Greek nationals.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.1/11">If there is a need for the Fundamental Rights Agency, it should deal with that sort of thing rather than mess around with the other expanded areas to which hon. Members have referred. For example, if the FRA looked at the inability of people to claim asylum in Turkey because it has opted out of many Geneva convention provisions, it might help to focus attention on the need to strengthen the Turkey-EU border.</p>

He cited</p>

Some might regret that they missed the opportunity to participate when they look at the record. Some of us hope we will catch Mr Speaker&#8217;s eye in tomorrow&#8217;s debate, and might do our prospects some damage if we speak in extenso this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.8/2">This is a worthwhile debate and it is fantastic that we have the opportunity to discuss the Bill. I disagree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40163" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place. He said that the relatively</p>
	<p pid="a.75.8/3">low attendance shows a lack of interest, but many hon. Members have looked at the issue and we are discussing it, and we look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.8/4">Obviously, most Europe debates from now on&#8212;for the next several years&#8212;will be preparatory to that great referendum. I would like the Government to start work on drawing up an audit of the costs and benefits of our EU membership. In the context of the Bill, they could do a lot worse than draw up an audit of the costs and benefits to this country of the work of the FRA compared with the work that is already being done in the Council of Europe&#8212;the Council of Europe&#8217;s work is being duplicated by the FRA.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.0/1">It is a great pleasure to take part in this wide-ranging debate on the Bill. Two of the three measures we have considered are fairly uncontroversial. The Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice has rightly said that the changes are not far-reaching and are largely technical. However, as was pointed out by the hon. Members for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris), for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood) and for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg), and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>, the third proposal&#8212;on the number of European commissioners&#8212;is more controversial and significant. I will come to that measure in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/2">The draft decision to give legally binding effect to the online version of the Official Journal of the European Union&#8212;notwithstanding the necessity to ensure that arrangements are in place for an electronic signature to be added to the online version to ensure authenticity&#8212;has come quite late in the day. Given that we are well into the 21st century&#8212;even if some hon. Members might wish to dispute this, or wish to go back in time&#8212;and given that the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice reminded us, with a little help, that there are 27 member states of the EU and 23 official languages published on a daily basis, the proposal for an online legal version might have been made earlier. We welcome the decision and support the Government in signing up to it. We are sure that it will facilitate a more efficient and economical legal publication and communication of legislation, other adopted Acts, information and notices, European Court of Justice judgments and invitations to tender for contracts. Given the climate change legislation we passed in government and the EU targets we have signed up to, I hope that printing fewer paper versions of the Official Journal will go some way to contributing to reaching those targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/3">Before I attended this debate, I thought the draft Council decision to establish a new multi-annual framework for the EU Fundamental Rights Agency for the period 2013-17 was relatively uncontroversial. Labour Members, at least, think it is a sensible way forward. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">The hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> mentioned the issues drawn out by the explanatory memorandum from the Justice Minister, Lord McNally&#8212;I tend to agree with him&#8212;who said that the agency</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/4">&#8220;provides a useful tool in measuring the impact of EU legislation on fundamental rights across Europe including, as appropriate, in candidate countries&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.0/5">The Council of Europe is not required to take on that role. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">The hon. Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase> cited the example of the FRA&#8217;s comparative legal analysis of the position for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transsexual people across EU states. This is a serious issue and a useful report. You will not be surprised to hear, Mr Deputy Speaker, that I am not in agreement with either the hon. Member for Stone or for Christchurch.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/1">I do not know how familiar the hon. Lady is with the Council of Europe and the work of the Parliamentary Assembly, but it comprises 47 countries. All the applicant states for membership of the European Union are members of the Council of Europe. The Council of Europe staff are currently dealing with all the issues she has described, but they do not have the extra resource that is now being put into the FRA.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.1/1">I assure the hon. Gentleman that as the shadow Minister for Europe I am well aware of the Council of Europe and its composition of 47 members, and I am well aware of its work. I will say again to the hon. Gentleman that I disagree with him. The Council of Europe does not have a role in measuring the impact of EU legislation, something I was just pointing out. If he checks the record, he will see that that is fact, not opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/2">The third draft decision is more controversial and relates to the number of European Commissioners. I agree with the hon. Member for Stone that this issue has been debated over and over again, not least during the most recent treaty change. It is an issue of great sensitivity for both small and large member states. The Lisbon treaty provided that from 2014&#8212;in other words, from the next European Commission&#8212;the number of European Commissioners should be two-thirds the number of member states. That was the position we came to at the end of the negotiations on the Lisbon treaty. However, as we know, Ireland asked for a change to this provision, and a guarantee that each member state would keep its commissioner in the years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/3">As hon. Members have said, there are two sides to this argument. Some argue that it is too cumbersome, unwieldy and inefficient to have one commissioner per member state, especially given that the EU is now composed of 27 member states&#8212;soon to be 28 later this year. Arguments have been put forward, particularly powerfully by smaller member states, that having one commissioner for each member state is the only way to secure equality. That is the Republic of Ireland&#8217;s position. As the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice said in his opening speech, there is a case for looking at the possibility of introducing some degree of seniority in the college of commissioners. We have also advocated the creation of a growth commissioner in the Commission. As the explanatory notes set out&#8212;this relates to the intervention made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40603" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for The Cotswolds (Geoffrey Clifton-Brown)</phrase>&#8212;the draft decision will not apply beyond 2019, and will cease to apply if the EU reaches 30 or more member states, whichever comes earlier. My best guess is the former.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/4">The issue is certainly still live, sensitive and controversial. I am sure it will be the subject of ongoing debate in years to come, so I do not think today&#8217;s debate in this House is the end of the matter. We will have to see which direction the debate takes. There are two sides of</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/5">the argument and we want to respect the sensitivities of smaller member states. That being said, I met the Danish ambassador earlier. She reminded me that Denmark&#8217;s position during the Lisbon treaty negotiations was that although it preferred to have its own commissioner, it was willing to give that up&#8212;not permanently, but on a rotating basis&#8212;if that meant that the European Commission and its college of commissioners could operate in a more efficient manner. I therefore think that this will be considered before we get to the 30th member state or beyond, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.1/6">We support the Government&#8217;s intention to approve the three draft decisions, and we support the Bill&#8217;s Second Reading.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.0/1">This has been perhaps a more thorough and detailed debate than one might have initially anticipated. I am grateful to all hon. Members who have spoken and contributed to the debate. As the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice said when he opened the debate with a typically eloquent and articulate introduction, the Prime Minister has recently set out the need to examine the UK&#8217;s relationship with the European Union. The debates held last week, both here and in the other place, provide an opportunity to start to discuss the broader issues of our relationship with Europe. There will be many opportunities further to examine that relationship. I would therefore like to limit my remarks to the specifics of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/2">I would first like to put on the record that it is because of the increased parliamentary control over EU decisions, which the Government delivered through the European Union Act 2011, that no UK Minister can vote in favour without first getting parliamentary approval&#8212;a very important point that a number of Members have made this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.1/1">I found the Bill interesting when I looked it up this morning on the internet. I read the explanatory notes, which refer to two draft decisions of the Council of the European Union and one draft decision of the European Council. Obviously, I know the Council of Europe is nothing to do with the EU, but what is the difference between the Council of the European Union and the European Council?</p>

	<p pid="a.78.2/1">Had the hon. Gentleman been here for the whole debate, he would have heard about that. I am happy to give way to hon. Members who have participated in this debate rather than to those who have just wandered into the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/2">It is because of increased parliamentary control that we are debating the elements in the Bill. It gives the House an opportunity to consider several technical measures designed to make the EU more efficient and accessible. The Bill will give parliamentary approval for the Government to agree with three EU decisions. The European Union Act 2011 requires us to seek that approval before the Government can vote in favour of them at EU level.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/3">As the House has heard, the first decision will give legal effect to the electronic version of the Official Journal of the European Union, which will make access</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/4">to EU law faster and more economical. The second decision will agree the work of the EU Fundamental Rights Agency for the next five years, which will ensure that the Council directs the work of the agency into areas considered to be a priority by member states. The third decision will maintain the current arrangement of having one EU commissioner per member state, which will fulfil a commitment to the Irish and will guarantee that the UK retains its commissioner and is in a stronger position to influence the make-up of the next Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/5">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40137" name="Wayne David">the hon. Member for Caerphilly (Wayne David)</phrase> for his support for the Bill. He rightly welcomed parliamentary scrutiny, but it was slightly perplexing that he also welcomed referendums, given his party&#8217;s position on not allowing the British people the right to decide on what relationship they wish to have with the EU. He also made an important point about the fundamental rights issue, to which I shall return in a minute.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/6">We then heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40198" name="Chris Heaton-Harris">the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris)</phrase>, who gave a typically knowledgeable and detailed contribution on the workings of the EU. He was right to highlight the importance of parliamentary scrutiny, the significant change that the Government made and how it was in the UK&#8217;s interest. I also welcome his support for these small, technical, but important, measures. He was correct to highlight the Lisbon treaty proposals and how they have since changed, particularly in how they relate to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/7">My hon. Friend will also be aware of the necessity, owing to the Irish position, of ensuring that each country has a commissioner, thus ensuring that the UK has a commissioner. He should be aware, however, that the draft decision states that that position should be reviewed when a new Commission is appointed in 2019 or when the number of EU member states exceeds 30, whichever is earliest. I reiterate to him that the Government are committed to having a leaner, less bureaucratic EU, to improving the efficiency of EU institutions, including the Commission, and to continuing to push for substantial reductions in the EU&#8217;s administration costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/8">We then heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase>, who forcefully argued for an EU commissioner for each country. Part of the Bill will ensure that the UK has the commissioner for the next Commission period. I reiterate to him what I said to my hon. Friend the Member for Daventry.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/9">Then we heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40163" name="Martin Horwood">the Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase>. I am grateful to him for his support for the Bill. When he started speaking, I wondered where he was going on the lack of necessity for scrutiny of these important aspects emanating from the EU, but I think he came full circle and, in the end, supported scrutiny. He will no doubt intervene if I have misinterpreted his remarks. I was also slightly perplexed by his comments about the capacity of smaller EU countries to manage a commissioner. Many small EU countries&#8217; commissioners have made a significant contribution to the EU, and I am sure they will do so in the next period.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/10">We then heard a traditionally articulate and passionate speech from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase>, who was absolutely right, yet again, to highlight the importance of scrutiny,</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/11">to recognise the vital role of the European Scrutiny Committee&#8212;a theme to which I shall return in a moment &#8212;and to highlight the significance of article 352, under which any powers brought forward must be agreed unanimously by the Council and EU Parliament. For the UK to agree that at the Council, however, and therefore for the required unanimity to be secured, the UK Parliament must first give its approval. That is what the Government have put in place under the 2011 Act. My hon. Friend was right to suggest that section 8 of the Act stated that a</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/12">&#8220;Minister of the Crown may not vote in favour of or otherwise support an Article 352 decision unless&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/13">it is approved by an Act of Parliament. That is why this level of detailed, forensic scrutiny is essential and in the UK&#8217;s interest. Without the agreement of Parliament, therefore, a proposal brought forward under this legal base cannot be adopted throughout the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.2/14">We then heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Mr Cash)</phrase>, who gave a traditionally detailed, analytical speech. I was pleased that he welcomed the Prime Minister&#8217;s announcement of the referendum, although I accept that perhaps he does not agree with the timing. I would also like to put on the record my congratulations to him on his chairmanship of the European Scrutiny Committee. He does a sterling job not only for the House, as was mentioned, but for the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.80.1/1">I am not sure I share that analysis, and I am quite sure that the Prime Minister thinks extremely highly of my hon. Friend the Member for Stone, who was right not only to underline the importance of scrutiny, as other Members did, but to point out that the Government reflected on his Committee&#8217;s suggestions &#8212;a good example of scrutiny working&#8212;and introduced proposals to pass primary legislation in the way that he and his Committee suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/2">We then heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase>, who detailed his thoughts and criticisms of how the FRA worked. I want to put on the record one or two facts in order to add to the debate that he will clearly have in Committee. The proposals do not expand the agency&#8217;s remit, but agree to a plan without which we would have much less control over its work. His example of wasting EU taxpayers&#8217; money in the way he alluded to is sadly not the only example he could have given. This is not a new agency, and the funds flow from the EU budget, which, as he will know, is under intense scrutiny and pressure from my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in order to ensure that UK taxpayers&#8217; money is spent wisely and for the purposes for which it was intended&#8212;an ethos that I know he supports very strongly.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/3">My hon. Friend also wanted to know whom the agency was accountable to. It is accountable to the Council of Ministers, which allocates the budgets. I know that he looks forward to delving in further detail into this matter in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/4">Finally, we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40668" name="Emma Reynolds">the hon. Member for Wolverhampton North East (Emma Reynolds)</phrase>. Again, I reiterate our thanks for the Opposition&#8217;s support. She</p>
	<p pid="a.80.1/5">was right again to highlight the issue of commissioners, although I will not repeat what I said about the position being reviewed when a new Commission is appointed in 2019 or when the number of EU member states exceeds 30, whichever is soonest.</p>

	<p pid="a.81.0/1">Will the Minister set out what the Government&#8217;s position will be when the time comes? As I said to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40603" name="Geoffrey Clifton-Brown">the hon. Member for The Cotswolds (Geoffrey Clifton-Brown)</phrase>, I think that 2019 will probably come before the 30th member joins. What will the Government argue for then?

	<p pid="a.81.1/1">I very much hope that by 2019 the British people will have had a say on what relationship they want to have with the European Union, in the context that the Prime Minister has set out. Depending on the result of that referendum, we will have to assess the answer to those questions and many others at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/2">Let me conclude by quickly setting out the four key tenets of the Bill. It ensures that Parliament has a key role in agreeing three decisions relating to the future of the EU. The UK took a strong line in negotiations on the work plan for the EU&#8217;s Fundamental Rights Agency. The electronic version of the Official Journal is faster and more economical than the current, print version. Agreeing to this decision backs the Government&#8217;s calls for a more efficient European Union. Agreeing to maintain the number of EU Commissioners will mean that the UK will be guaranteed a commissioner when the next EU Commission is appointed in 2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/3">The Government have given full consideration to all three measures. We are satisfied that they are in the best interests of the UK and are sensible and reasonable proposals. None of them has a significant impact. In particular, none will result in any additional financial</p>
	<p pid="a.81.1/4">burdens being imposed on the United Kingdom. This debate is an excellent example of UK parliamentary scrutiny working to the United Kingdom&#8217;s benefit in the context of our relationship with the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="a.83.1/5">The Government are facilitating the protection of both the Opposition half-day allocated to the Democratic Unionist party and the opposed private business set down for Wednesday, with three hours each.

	<p pid="a.83.2/1">Briefly, I see no reason at all why we cannot have the normal arrangements, whereby three hours is allocated to private business between 4 o&#8217;clock and 7 o&#8217;clock on Wednesday. When such motions have been carried in the past, they have sometimes resulted in the private business continuing beyond 7 o&#8217;clock and the people promoting and speaking to that business being criticised by the Whips and colleagues for keeping the House late. The private business should be taken between 4 o&#8217;clock and 7 o&#8217;clock, and if the business managers so arrange things that they cannot deal with the other business before 4 o&#8217;clock and the private business has to continue after 7 o&#8217;clock, so be it. Obviously I am not going to divide the House on this matter this evening, but I put people on notice that if on Wednesday the private business continues beyond 7 o&#8217;clock and people start bellyaching about it, I hope they will not bellyache against those of us who take a keen interest in private business, but will criticise the Government and the business managers.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.2/1">I am very grateful indeed for the opportunity to have this debate. I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40404" name="Iain Stewart">the hon. Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart)</phrase> and a number of others may be able to participate, given the time at which we are starting. I am also grateful that the Minister is in his place to respond on what is obviously a busy day for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, given the visit of President Hamid Karzai and President Asif Ali Zardari. That visit makes this a timely debate&#8212;I will return to that point in a few moments.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/2">On the Wednesday before last, I and a number of colleagues from across the House helped to organise a lobby of Parliament by members of the British Hazara community. That was the week in which many right hon. and hon. Members were signing the memorial book for Holocaust memorial day. That event asks us all each year to be aware that genocidal persecution on religious and ethnic grounds is not simply an appalling past event but an ever-present danger that we have to be aware of. The persecution of the Hazara community, in Quetta and other parts of Balochistan, is undoubtedly persecution for religious and ethnic reasons&#8212;it bears those strong hallmarks&#8212;and that is the issue I want to raise today.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/3">The last time this matter was raised on the Adjournment was in a debate led by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40346" name="Alan Johnson">the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2013-03-01">1 March</phrase> last year. The Minister responded to that debate too. I am sure that when he speaks the Minister will agree that things have not improved for the Hazaras in Quetta since that debate last March.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/4">I do not want to pretend that I have long been aware of the history and plight of Hazaras; the truth is that I was not. Beyond some references to the community in novels such as &#8220;The Kite Runner&#8221; and an awareness of the small&#8212;about 150&#8212;but distinctive community in Southampton, of whom I had met a few, I had relatively little knowledge of the Hazara community. As a group, the Hazaras are physically quite distinctive, with somewhat Mongolian looks, and that distinctive appearance has helped to contribute to their vulnerability in Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/5">I did not know a great deal about the history and the plight of the Hazara community until a group of my constituents came to see me earlier this year. The story they told me truly appalled me. Theirs is a long history, and I will not attempt to rehearse it here tonight. Suffice it to say that the community originated in central Asia, in the Afghan central highlands. The Hazaras converted to Shi&#8217;a Islam in the 13th century, and while the majority remain Shi&#8217;a, there are now Sunnis, Ismailis and secular members of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/6">Persecution of the Hazara community by Afghan rulers started, I am afraid, under the British Empire, and it has been a consistent problem in Afghanistan ever since. Many Hazaras have left Afghanistan, and over 100 years ago many settled in and around Quetta, which in due course became part of Pakistan. We are all familiar with the recent waves of refugees from Afghanistan to Pakistan, some of whom have eventually made their way here, where they have sought and been granted asylum.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/7">However, the Hazaras that I am talking about today are part of that much longer-established community in Quetta who are not refugees but Pakistani citizens. For a long time, they lived free from persecution in Quetta, thriving educationally and economically. As citizens, they are entitled to full support from the Pakistani state. Since the late 1990s, however, their situation has changed dramatically. The killings started in 1999. Since then, more than 1,000 Hazaras have been killed in Quetta, 3,000 or more have been injured, and 55,000 or so have been forced to flee to Europe or Australia. All of those came from a population of between 500,000 and 600,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/8">The perpetrators are a banned Sunni militant al-Qaeda-affiliated group called Lashkar-e-Jhangvi&#8212;the LEJ. The Taliban and the LEJ have both issued fatwas against the Hazaras. After the recent violence, an LEJ spokesman was reported as saying that the Hazaras had been warned in 2012 that they should leave Balochistan, the province in which Quetta sits, and that as many had not done so, the LEJ will not allow Shi&#8217;as to leave alive in 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/9">That is the background to the dreadful bombing in Quetta on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-10">10 January</phrase> this year. The death toll was well above 100, and more than 120 people were injured. One of my reasons for seeking this debate is that although that incident was widely reported on television and radio and in the press, the reporting rarely gave any context to the violence, which was generally reported as simply another bomb attack in Pakistan. Some reports alluded to a generalised struggle between Sunni and Shi&#8217;a Muslims. The few that even mentioned the Hazaras did not explain their history, the background to their situation or the agency of their persecution. One of the reasons for having this debate is to put on public record at least some of that background, and to challenge some of the myths.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.2/10">One such myth is that the persecution is a manifestation of some generalised Sunni-Shi&#8217;a conflict that has manifested itself from time to time in regional tensions in other parts of the middle east. I do not believe that that is the case. It is clear from the targets of the violence and from the death toll that the violence is directed at just one distinctive community within the wider Shi&#8217;a community. I understand that the Hazaras of Quetta are 33 times more likely to be killed by political violence than members of the wider Shi&#8217;a community in Pakistan. That constitutes a focus on a particular religious and ethnic group.</p>

Is he aware that, despite the 1,000 deaths, the local government in Pakistan&#8212;which, fortunately, has now been disbarred by the Pakistani Government&#8212;has not brought a single charge against anyone for the offences, and that not one member of that government has ever condemned any of the atrocities?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-04a.86.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40563" speakername="John Denham" colnum="86"  time="019:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000364">
	<p pid="a.86.1/1">One of the most serious problems is that there has been no acceptance of responsibility by the Pakistani authorities of the kind that we would expect in a serious situation such as this. I hope that the Minister will be able to tell us what representations Her Majesty&#8217;s Government have been able to make to the Pakistani authorities on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/2">The problem with the ill-informed, shallow or sweeping reporting that we have seen is that it tends to obscure the real causes of the violence and to obscure the responsibilities. It allows the incidents to be shrugged off as though that is &#8220;just the way things are&#8221;. Since 1990, the violence has included ride-by and drive-by shootings, personal attacks, suicide bombings, rocket attacks and car bombs, as well as the ambushing of buses and taxis and the subsequent selection of Hazara passengers for execution.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/3">This is not the first time that my constituents have alerted me to what has happened to their relatives. Under the last Government, I took constituents who had family in the Swat valley in Pakistan to meet Lord Malloch-Brown, then a Foreign Office Minister, to alert him to the violence being carried out by the Pakistan Taliban. My constituents had come to me with stark examples of what had happened to members of their families in the recent past. I shall not give the House details of names, as family members might suffer as a result, but I have received clear documentation of constituents who had seen family members&#8212;male breadwinners&#8212;singled out for murder in three separate incidents over the past three years. The effects of that are devastating for the entire family. In a country with little in the way of a social security system, the loss of a male breadwinner has an impact on every member of the extended family.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/4">There are wider consequences too. The Hazaras in Quetta have to live in isolation from other Pakistani citizens, not least because those other citizens fear being caught up in the violence. They suffer travel restrictions, and virtually all the Hazara students in Quetta have dropped out of university, following attacks on student transport. Hazara people have also faced difficulty in accessing civil service jobs. As has already been pointed out, however, not a single terrorist has yet been prosecuted. On the rare occasions when individuals have been arrested, they have been released. The provincial governor has been replaced, but little action seems to have been taken as yet.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/5">The failure of the Pakistan authorities to safeguard the Hazara community is surely beyond doubt, but concerns remain about a much more sinister involvement. It is alleged that the intelligence services, the Inter-Services Intelligence, sections of which have a history of involvement with extremist forces, have links in some ways to the LEJ. I want to put it on record that I do not know whether such links are documented or what the strength of the evidence is, but the concerns about those potential connections are widely shared among those I have spoken to.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.1/6">There are complicated provincial politics in Balochistan, involving not only the movements I have mentioned. The province is also tied up in the wider regional conflict, and there have been separatist movements and movements calling for autonomy. Many Hazaras believe that they have been caught up as innocent victims in the wider geo-politics.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/1">My right hon. Friend is describing the confusion and rumours that are spreading about this issue. There seems to be a real case for a proper judicial inquiry to expose what is happening and to call the Government of Pakistan to account. The</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/2">chief justice of Pakistan has expressed his willingness to do that, and I believe that he is the right person to conduct such an inquiry. Will my right hon. Friend urge the Minister to make representations to the Government of Pakistan to convince them that that might be a way forward that has not yet been tried?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-04a.88.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40563" speakername="John Denham" colnum="88"  time="019:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000366">
	<p pid="a.88.0/1">My hon. Friend has put forward an interesting proposal. I am about to put my specific points to the Minister on the action that could be taken, and I invite him to respond to my hon. Friend&#8217;s proposal about the chief justice as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/2">The points I wish to put to the Minister are these. First, will he tell us whether the position of the Hazaras been raised with either the President of Pakistan or members of his delegation over the past two days when he was in this country on other matters? If not, when were these issues last raised by Ministers from Her Majesty&#8217;s Government with the Pakistani authorities, and what was the response?</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/3">Secondly, there are, of course, huge issues in this region that are currently under discussion&#8212;not least today between our own Prime Minister and the Presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan. Does the Minister agree that while these supra-regional questions are being settled, the position of those such as the Hazaras must not be overlooked, left on one side or seen as too small, too trivial or too local to be taken into account? Will the Minister give me an assurance about the Government&#8217;s efforts to ensure that the Hazara community&#8212;in Quetta, of course, but also in Afghanistan&#8212;are not left on one side?</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/4">Thirdly, will the Minister give us an undertaking that the plight of the Hazaras in Quetta will be an explicit issue to be raised when the conditions of aid to Pakistan are discussed? Fourthly, what has the British high commissioner&#8212;and, indeed, Ministers&#8212;done to raise the profile of this persecution within Pakistan itself? Have Ministers or high commission officials visited Quetta to see the conditions faced by the Hazaras?</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/5">Fifthly, would the Minister be willing to facilitate a visit to Quetta by Members of this House? And sixthly, at UN level, will the Government ask the conflict prevention unit within the Bureau for Crisis Prevention of the UN Development Programme to assess whether the situation in Quetta is, or is tending towards, genocide, and in general to push for the engagement of the conflict prevention unit in this particular situation?</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/6">I have two further points. The Minister has in the past rightly expressed the truth that a range of minority groups have suffered and do suffer oppression and discrimination in Pakistan. In part, though, the Pakistan Government have tended to respond on the Hazara issue by questioning why a single group should be highlighted for attention. Does the Minister agree that although a number of groups face oppression, that is no good reason to lump them all together as part of a generalised concern for human rights, but makes it all the more essential to understand the history, the particularities and the nature of the oppressors in each case and to ensure appropriate action is taken in each case?</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/7">For the past two years, the position of the Hazaras has been referred to by name in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office human rights report. I welcome that, and I assume the same will happen again this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/8">In the Minister&#8217;s response to my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle last March, he quite rightly stressed the importance of our relationship with Pakistan and our friendship with that country. My own experience has been one of positive engagement with the high commissioner on a range of issues. The importance of this relationship makes it all the more vital that we are consistent and insistent on raising these issues, particularly for my constituents in those cases that are so intimately linked by family and history to communities in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40563" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr Denham)</phrase> on securing this important debate, and I thank him for his courtesy in allowing me to say a few words. He has comprehensively and eloquently set out the plight of the Hazara community in Pakistan. I am happy to endorse the points he made.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/2">Like Southampton, Milton Keynes is home to a sizeable Hazara community. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster)</phrase> and I have spent a considerable amount of time meeting members of that community and working with them. Last year, we had the great honour of attending their annual school prize-giving day&#8212;a warm and jolly occasion that served to underline the warmth and depth of community spirit among them in Milton Keynes. That makes it even more galling to learn about the stories of their kinsmen and loved ones being persecuted, injured and killed in Pakistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.0/3">The numbers involved are quite shocking. The right hon. Gentleman has given us a list. The impact of the killings and of the injuries sustained among the community as a whole has been absolutely shocking. Let me provide a few other examples. A decade ago, there were 300 students at the main university in Quetta. After all the death threats and the persecutions, there are not any today. About 80% of Hazara businesses have either had to be sold or closed down. There are 3,000 orphans or children living in poverty because the main breadwinner has been killed. As we have heard, there is no semblance of a social security system there. Then there are the thousands killed or maimed&#8212;yet not one arrest of the perpetrators. Those figures are shocking, but it is only when we hear personal examples that the true scale of the horror comes home.</p>

	<p pid="a.89.1/1">I join the hon. Gentleman in congratulating my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40563" name="John Denham">the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr Denham)</phrase> on securing this enormously important debate. I was pleased to join the big meeting that the hon. Gentleman sponsored in the House of Commons, for which I thank him. Was it not deeply moving both to hear the testimony of the people there and to experience their confidence that making their representations through this House to the Government might produce real change in the interest of justice for the Hazaras?</p>

	<p pid="a.89.2/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for that intervention and he is absolutely right. That recent meeting was one of the most powerful I have ever attended in this place. It was heart warming to encounter the strength of feeling and the optimism among members of the community that we might be able to effect some</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/2">positive influence or change. I will certainly continue to do all I can, and I know that the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues will do the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/3">In preparing for this debate, I spoke to some of my constituents and those of my hon. Friend the Member for Milton Keynes North to get their personal stories about what has happened. A gentleman by the name of Nasir Abbas was a relative of my constituents Mokhtar and Shalia Ali. He was 34 and he was the main breadwinner of the family; the rest of the family depended on him, yet he was killed in a suicide attack. The family is now living in squalor, with no real way of supporting themselves. The family then suffered again, when the father-in-law received a death threat and not long afterwards suffered a fatal heart attack&#8212;yet another tragedy for the family. That is just one of many similar examples that go on today.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/4">As the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen mentioned, we have not long since marked holocaust memorial day. At the weekend, I attended a couple of plays in one of Milton Keynes&#8217;s theatres by a group called &#8220;voices of the holocaust&#8221;. The very powerful plays depicted the escalation of persecution in Nazi Germany in the 1930s. It was an historical reminder of what went on and of the fact that that same kind of persecution happens today, which places on us a great duty to stand up and speak out against it. I have done a lot of work with the community across the country, and I am happy to endorse the resolutions they passed in the conference on genocide.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/5">I appreciate that this area is a dangerous and difficult part of the world, but that does not absolve us from taking action. I know that the Minister has taken a keen interest in the matter. I urge him, in addition to answering the specific questions raised by the right hon. Gentleman, to do all he can to work bilaterally with the Pakistani authorities, but also multilaterally through the United Nations. I think that it, too, has a significant role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.89.2/6">Of all the points made by the right hon. Gentleman, the one I would particularly emphasise concerned the need to use the lever of British aid to bring about some positive action. As the conference has demonstrated during the past couple of days, we are not without influence in that part of the world. I owe it to my constituents to stand up and highlight the plight of their kinsmen, and this country owes it to those people to stand up for them, to speak out, and to use what influence we have to improve this dreadful situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.0/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40563" name="John Denham">the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr Denham)</phrase> for allowing me to trespass on his debate for what I hope will be only a couple of moments.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/2">Hazaras do not stand out from the rest of the population of Hammersmith. I was not well acquainted with them until I was introduced to the local Hazara community, and before that I would not have distinguished them from the Afghanistan, Mongolian and south Asian minorities in my constituency. Sadly for them, however, they do stand out in Pakistan, and they have been victimised to an extent that cannot be overemphasised.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/3">I want to make two points to the Minister. First, what is intended by the alliance between the LEJ, sections of</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/4">the Taliban and, possibly, sections of the security services is nothing short of genocide. A threatening letter issued last year told Hazaras in Quetta:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/5">&#8220;Just as our fighters have waged a successful jihad against the Shia-Hazaras in Afghanistan, our mission&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/6">&#8212;in Pakistan&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/7">&#8220;is the abolition of this impure sect and people&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/8">Last August, a report from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/9">&#8220;Hazaras have been&#8230;uprooted from Machh, Loralai and Zhob. It seems a campaign has been launched to terrorize the Hazara community so that they leave Quetta by selling their businesses and property at throwaway prices. Pamphlets have been left at their homes telling them to sell their houses and leave.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/10">That sustained and organised campaign of murder and aggression led to the appalling snooker hall bombings of <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-10">10 January</phrase>&#8212;the second bomb was designed to kill those who had come to save the victims of the first&#8212;and the harrowing sight, which I think we all saw on the news, of the bodies of the dead remaining unburied, and of relatives waiting with the coffins for three days, in sub-zero temperatures, to make public the plight of the whole community. In the end, it was that, and only that, which embarrassed the Pakistani Government and the Prime Minister enough to make them step in and impose governor&#8217;s rule in the province over the&#8212;I do not think that this is an exaggeration&#8212;gimcrack Government who had behaved in the way I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.90.0/11">Yes, there is effective military rule at present, and yes&#8212;thank God&#8212;there have been no more atrocities; but no one believes that the security situation has been resolved. Military rule is not the solution in the longer term. The Hazaras do not want that any more than anyone else. They simply want to live in peace in their own country, with their neighbours, as they did for so many decades. That is an obligation for the Pakistani Government, and it is an obligation that I hope the Minister will address in his response to my right hon. Friend&#8217;s points. I hope the Minister will tell us how the British Government can help the Hazara population&#8212;the diaspora in this country and elsewhere, but principally those in Pakistan&#8212;to secure what they want, which is simply the ability to live in peace and security in their own homes.</p>

Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr Denham)</phrase> on securing the debate, and thank him for&#8212;with his usual courtesy&#8212;giving me his text in advance this afternoon. I thank other Members for attending and intervening, and I also thank my hon.

Member for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter)</phrase> for their speeches.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">This has been a sobering half hour or so. Although it is a year since we last debated the issue, it remains as important and relevant as it was then, and probably more so. It is an issue in which I had an opportunity to take a personal interest when I met some of the constituents of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster)</phrase>, and I welcome the opportunity to discuss it again.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3">Since our last debate, my responsibilities in the Department have changed to some extent. I no longer have territorial responsibility for Afghanistan and Pakistan, which are now the responsibility of my noble Friend Baroness Warsi. However, I still answer for those issues in the House of Commons, and one of the first things I will do is bring the debate and the comments of colleagues to the attention of my noble Friend.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">I appreciate that there has been a reshuffle of responsibilities in the Department, but would my hon. Friend be able to arrange a meeting with Baroness Warsi and interested Members so that we can explore the issues with her directly?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-04a.92.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="92"  time="019:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000373">
	<p pid="a.92.1/1">That is a good idea. If my hon. Friend had asked me for such a meeting, I should have been able to say yes straight away. I can say, however&#8212; without committing my noble Friend&#8212;that I am sure I shall be able to convey to her both my hon. Friend&#8217;s comment and the general feeling of the House that a meeting with a group of colleagues who understand the issue well would be particularly welcome to them, and, no doubt, welcome to those whom they represent. I shall make that point very clearly.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/2">Since our last debate, the position of the Hazara community in Pakistan has remained extremely difficult. Human Rights Watch estimates that at least 320 members of the Shia community were killed in targeted attacks in 2012, including many from the Hazara community. As has was mentioned earlier, only last month&#8212;on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-10">10 January</phrase>&#8212;twin bomb attacks in Quetta tragically killed nearly 100 people and injured over 200 more in the circumstances described by the hon. Member for Hammersmith. Most of those who were killed were members of the Hazara community.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/3">Those horrendous acts of sectarian violence showed an appalling contempt for human life. Both my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and Baroness Warsi publicly expressed the UK&#8217;s strong condemnation of the attacks, and their concern about the persecution that had been suffered. My right hon. Friend said:</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/4">&#8220;I was extremely saddened to hear of the brutal terrorist and sectarian attacks in Quetta and Swat yesterday.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/5">He sent his sincere condolences to the bereaved families, and added:</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/6">&#8220;I wish all those injured in the attacks a swift recovery. The United Kingdom strongly condemns these senseless attacks and the persecution of the Shia population. It was a tragic day for Pakistan. We will continue to stand with the people of Pakistan in their fight against terror and violent extremism.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/7">The latest bombings, described as one of the worst attacks on the Shia community, resulted in nationwide protests. The families of the bomb victims refused to bury their dead until they were given assurances that the Army would take administrative control of the province. As the House will know, late in the evening on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-13">Sunday 13 January</phrase>, Sardar Aslam Raisani, the Chief Minister of Baluchistan, was dismissed by Prime Minister Ashraf for failing to prevent the escalating sectarian violence in the province. Zulfiqar Ali Magsi, the Governor of Baluchistan and the most senior official in the province, has now been temporarily put in charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/8">Baluchistan&#8217;s problems are deep-rooted and require long-term solutions, which was well understood by those who spoke this evening. Although some members of the Hazara community have called for military rule</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/9">to protect their rights, the position of the United Kingdom Government is that it is in Pakistan&#8217;s long-term interests for all groups to enjoy meaningful political representation to ensure effective political engagement and a peaceful means of protecting their interests. Any solution must stay within the parameters of Pakistan&#8217;s constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/10">We remain deeply concerned about the violent persecution faced by all minority groups in Pakistan. We raise their plight with the Government of Pakistan regularly. My noble Friend Baroness Warsi spoke about it with Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar at the UN General Assembly in September, and, most recently, during her visit to Pakistan in November, when she urged Pakistani Ministers to protect and guarantee the fundamental rights of all Pakistani citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/11">Additionally, at Pakistan&#8217;s recent universal periodic review at the UN in October, the UK raised the importance of ensuring the ability of all minorities groups to vote freely in the upcoming elections. We also encouraged Pakistan to implement the international covenant on civil and political rights to ensure the equal and absolute rights of all its citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/12">The UK and Pakistan have a long history and a strong relationship founded on mutual respect, mutual trust and mutual benefit. Our respect for Pakistan&#8217;s sovereignty and territorial integrity is absolute. I must make it clear to the House that the security of Baluchistan is, as with all provinces of Pakistan, a matter for the people and Government of Pakistan. Persecution of the Shi&#8217;a Hazaras is not limited to Baluchistan; across Pakistan, Sunni and Shi&#8217;a alike have suffered from the scourge of sectarian violence. In the past year, Karachi, Pakistan&#8217;s largest city and financial nerve centre, has seen an increase in sectarianism, which has led to a 28% rise in violence-related deaths.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/13">Before I make any more general remarks, let me deal with the specific questions that the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen put, as he was good enough to give me some notice of them. The new question, however, was the one raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> relating to the chief justice and the possibility of a judicial inquiry, and I will draw Baroness Warsi&#8217;s attention to that as a potential idea. At the end of his remarks, the right hon. Gentleman raised a point about recognising the importance of dealing with all groups that suffer persecution in Pakistan and elsewhere in a generic manner. That does not, however, mean that their individual histories or problems are not recognised as singular issues in the overall context of the importance of the rule of law being enforced everywhere, which is the best way of protecting everyone. Even within that, we should recognise that particular circumstances should be prominent and I will return to that important point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/14">The right hon. Gentleman asked whether the position of the Hazaras has been raised with the President of Pakistan or with members of the delegation over the past couple of days. It did not form part of the general conversation in the past couple of days in relation to the regional issue, but it is very much a part of a recognition of the overall settlement in Afghanistan that the rights of minorities, including those of the Hazara, need to be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/15">As we have been generously gifted a little more time by the time fairies of the Commons doing their work earlier today&#8212;I could name my hon. Friends, but I shall not on this occasion&#8212;let me say a bit about the position</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/16">of Hazaras in Afghanistan. The UK Government are very aware of the challenging circumstances faced by the Hazaras in Afghanistan. Article 22 of the Afghan constitution makes clear provision for the equal rights of all Afghan citizens, and we will continue to remind the Afghan Government of the need to ensure those rights. We have also made it clear that a political settlement should be inclusive and should address the needs of all Afghan citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/17">Since 2001, the situation has improved for Hazaras in Afghanistan, with Hazaras now in senior Afghan Government positions. They include the second vice-President, the acting higher education Minister and the governor of Bamiyan province&#8212;the first female provincial governor&#8212;Habiba Sarabi, whom I have met. We welcome that progress and we will continue to remind the Afghan Government of the need to ensure the equal rights of all citizens. In the regional context, any settlement in Afghanistan that makes sense will have to include proper attention being given to human rights. That was a key part of what the international community stressed in the agreements signed last year and it will be a key part of what happens post-2014. As we all know, the need for the closest relationship possible between Afghanistan and Pakistan in a future settlement is emphasised by the trilateral meetings taking place today. Again, I assure the right hon. Gentleman and the House that although the specific position of the Hazaras is unlikely to constitute a specific part of those conversations, there is a recognition that the future of both Afghanistan and Pakistan cannot be assured unless serious attention is paid to the rule of law and ensuring the enforcement of human rights protection right across both states. Without that, neither state will have security and stability, which is going to be of prime importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.1/18">The right hon. Gentleman asked whether I would ensure that the plight of the Hazaras will be explicitly raised when the conditions of aid to Pakistan are discussed. Taking advice from the Department for International Development, I would say that all UK aid to any country is based on three shared commitments with partner Governments: poverty reduction and meeting the millennium development goals; respecting human rights and other international obligations; and strengthening financial management and accountability. We do not use those conditions to impose specific policy choices on countries. In Pakistan, our aid will support the Pakistan authorities in making progress in the relevant areas, including through concrete measures to improve the economy, reform education and devote proper attention to human rights. So although these things are an important part of the bargain made with any particular country, we do not make our aid conditional on specific issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.94.0/1">I welcome the remarks the Minister has made so far, and the way in which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40563" name="John Denham">the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr Denham)</phrase> and other hon. Members have educated me and the whole House about the plight of the Hazara community. Does the Minister agree that we should not extend that idea of conditionality too far in relation to British aid? Under both this Government and the previous Labour Government, aid has been focused on helping those in greatest need, particularly the poorest and most vulnerable, including those in conflict-afflicted and fragile states such as Pakistan. It would be regrettable if we departed too far from that principle.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.0/1">On balance, I share the view of my hon. Friend. The difficulty with making aid conditional is that the determination to withdraw aid is aimed at a Government, but there are many occasions when atrocities take place and the Government may not be totally in charge of a situation&#8212;equally, there are circumstances where Governments appear to be all too certain to be implicated. The process is difficult, but until now the situation has clearly been straightforward and aid has not been conditional. Despite that, it is important that countries receiving aid adhere to human rights.</p>

	<p pid="a.95.1/1">Having worked in development before I entered this House, I, too, have some sympathy with the idea that imposing crude conditionality is not a good use of aid. The question really is: when the discussions take place between DFID Ministers and officials, and the Pakistan Government, is the second of the three challenges that the Minister set out&#8212;human rights&#8212;raised in a general way? Alternatively, as a way of illustrating what needs to change, is the position of the Hazaras, for example, specifically raised as the sort of test of, and the sort of thing that we would have in mind in deciding, whether human rights were being properly protected? Part of the challenge is simply to make sure that in wanting to include all the issues in a general way we do not lose the ability to say, &#8220;This is one of the ways in which we measure progress.&#8221;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-04a.95.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" speakername="Alistair Burt" colnum="95"  time="019:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130204/debtext/130204-0003.htm#13020434000377">
	<p pid="a.95.2/1">I absolutely take the point and understand fully how the right hon. Gentleman expresses it, which is absolutely in line with his experience. As a result of the debate, I shall write to the Secretary of State for International Development and make that point directly to her. We use examples in our report on countries of concern, as the right hon. Gentleman has picked out, and by using specific issues relating to the Hazaras and their situation I am seeking to demonstrate that they are not lost in the generality. He makes the point that they could be used as a specific examples&#8212;I do not know whether DFID does that but I will draw the attention of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to his precise question.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/2">On the question of the role of the British high commissioners and Ministers in raising the profile of the persecution in Pakistan, officials have not visited Quetta because of the security situation, although they have met Hazara representatives in the high commission in Islamabad. The same security situation that has made it impossible for us to visit in the past year would apply to facilitating visits for Members. Our travel advice is simply not to go because of the danger. It is never possible to prevent Members of Parliament from travelling wherever they wish, but my advice would be to recognise the travel advice offered by colleagues. As we advise all UK individuals not to go at this stage, I am not sure whether we could facilitate such a trip.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/3">The right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s last question was to ask us to take matters up directly with the conflict prevention unit at the bureau of crisis prevention and recovery at the UNDP to assess whether the situation in Quetta is tending towards genocide. I do not know the answer to that question, so I shall write to him and put a copy of the letter in the Library to allow other interested colleagues to see it. I did not have enough time to deal with that question before the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/4">As I mentioned earlier, the problems faced by the Hazaras are not limited to that group. That brings me back to the issue facing Pakistan in general, but notwithstanding the difficulties of Hazaras in Pakistan it is important to set them in the overall context of how difficult it is and what hopes there are of settling the situation in the near and medium term.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/5">Minorities across Pakistan have at times endured terrible persecution and violence. There was the attack on Malala Yousafzai, the 14-year-old girl of whom we are all well aware from the pictures of her on the television today. I emphasise the joy we all feel at her recovery and the extraordinary bravery with which she faced those conditions and answered questions in the interviews today. The attack on Malala shocked everyone and was an example of the extraordinary and completely unjustified brutality of men against women in that part of the world. The UK Government strongly support the efforts of Malala and the Government of Pakistan to ensure that all children in Pakistan have access to education in a safe environment, free from the threat of terrorism. The only good thing that came out of that horror was the public demonstration in support of her and of education, with men and women in Pakistan saying that they had put up with enough. If only such demonstrations could also be seen on the streets of those places that have suffered the worst outbreaks of terrorism in Pakistan, more corners would be turned.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/6">There is some light, occasionally, in these difficult situations, such as the case of Rimsha Masih, the young Christian girl who was arrested for blasphemy last August. The charges against her were dropped by the Supreme Court because of a lack of evidence and a certain amount of disquiet in the region about the charges brought against her. Again, she was a member of another minority suffering from persecution. There is hope in Pakistan that the case will be a catalyst for change and that future cases can be properly investigated and pursued.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/7">In August, President Zardari publically acknowledged the problems faced by Pakistan&#8217;s minorities and emphasised his Government&#8217;s support for ending discrimination, which was a first step in the process of dealing with violence against minorities. Although Pakistan still has a long way to go in dealing with those issues, as a friend of Pakistan we offer our robust support in addressing the problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/8">Sixty five years ago, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, shared his vision for the newly created nation with the first constituent assembly. He said there should be</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/9">&#8220;no discrimination between one caste or creed and another&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/10">for Pakistan is founded with the</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/11">&#8220;fundamental principle that we are all citizens and equal citizens of one state&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/12">We know many statesmen and women from Pakistan who believe in and support his words. Although Pakistan has yet to fulfil Jinnah&#8217;s dream of a nation made up of</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/13">&#8220;equal citizens of one state&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/14">I have been encouraged and inspired by the many Pakistanis I have met who are working tirelessly to realise that&#8212;none more so than my friend the late Shahbaz Bhatti, the Minister of National Harmony and Minority Affairs, whose work towards peaceful, moderate change was met with such brutal violence and his death. His brother Paul Bhatti has taken up that cause with energy and commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/15">I am also heartened by the work that we are doing in the UK to promote the right to freedom of religion and of belief worldwide. Last month, my right hon. Friend the noble Baroness Warsi convened a ministerial level meeting to secure political support for the UN Human Rights Council resolution 16/18 to tackle religious intolerance and foster religious freedom and pluralism. It was encouraging to see Pakistan represented at that meeting and to hear its commitment to the agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/16">As hon. Members know, the human rights situation in Pakistan remains complex. Although the past 24 months have seen some positive political and legal developments on human rights issues, successful and fair implementation remains a huge challenge. As I mentioned in my speech last year, enhancing the rule of law in Pakistan is crucial to improving the plight of the Hazaras and other minority groups. I am pleased to say that, since our last debate, this Government have launched a programme to help to improve Pakistan&#8217;s ability successfully to investigate, prosecute, convict and detain terrorists in a human rights compliant manner. We are working with Pakistan and the international community to deliver a range of programmes, such as training and mentoring, in support of that long-term goal.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/17">Looking to the future, the upcoming elections later this year will be a crucial milestone in Pakistan&#8217;s democratic history. Helping Pakistan to deliver credible elections</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/18">that lead to a peaceful transfer of power will be a top priority for the UK in 2013. We will also encourage Pakistan and its new Government to step up their actions and implementation of international obligations on human rights. Essential changes will happen only with the political support of the authorities. We will continue to focus on the rights of minorities through frank senior level discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/19">The UK is committed to an enduring relationship with Pakistan and we will continue to work with the leaders of Pakistan and its people. At the universal periodic review of Pakistan last October, Pakistan&#8217;s Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar spoke of Pakistan&#8217;s aspiration to be a society that is based on equality, the rule of law, respect for diversity and justice. As a friend of Pakistan we have a distinctive role to play in supporting that aspiration. As the House has made clear this evening, how the Hazara community and its issues are treated will form part of the judgment on how Pakistan is responding to the challenges it is rightly setting itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/20">I am grateful for the support of colleagues and to the right hon. Gentleman for raising the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/21" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.95.2/22" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
