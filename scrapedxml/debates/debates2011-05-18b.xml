	<p pid="b.333.3/1">As I said, I have not heard the interview, but the point is this: it should be a matter for the court to decide the seriousness of the offence and the sentence that ought to be passed. I served on the Sexual Offences Bill under the last Government, where we looked at all the issues about whether we should try to differentiate between different categories of rape&#8212;and I seem to remember that one of the right hon. Gentlemen now sitting on the Opposition Front Bench was leading the debate for the Government. We decided, as a House of Commons, not to make that distinction. What matters is this: do we get more cases to court, do we get more cases convicted, and do we get more cases sent down for decent sentences? That is the concern we should have.</p>

	<p pid="b.344.0/1">The nightmare of Fukushima continues and intensifies. In the past seven days, the no-go area has been extended from 20 km to 30 km, and the residents of the towns of Kawamata and Iitate have been expelled from their homes. There is now proof that the greatly feared meltdown has taken place, and it is out of control. This is all in the past seven days. It is not possible in just eight weeks to make any assessment of the extent of this terrifying event, but that is what the Government have tried to do. This is not about science; this is about spin and PR. The whole reason for putting out the report so prematurely is to shore up collapsing public opinion and investor opinion.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.0/2">Of course Britain is not Japan, as the report says, but there have been tsunamis here too. There was one that affected my constituency, destroying all human and animal life, and that was on the Severn estuary, where several nuclear power stations are placed. Our threat comes from two possibilities: a terrorist attack, and especially an attack by air, or a unique climatic event. Sadly, unique climatic events are happening regularly throughout the world and are more likely to happen in future because of the climate change that is afore us. The residents of Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima were all assured of the absolute safety of the installations. What Weightman does is give false reassurances for commercial reasons, to suit the Government&#8217;s programme. This report has been produced in haste. We may regret at leisure shoring up this unnecessary, subsidised form of energy creation, which the public, because of their well founded fears, might in future prevent from being built. It is right that we should look again at the lessons of Fukushima. We do not know what they are at the moment. We should pause and look to developing the safe renewables that are inexhaustible, British and sustainable.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.344.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40236" speakername="Christopher Huhne" colnum="344"  time="012:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0001.htm#11051871001488">
	<p pid="b.344.1/1">I respect the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s long-standing opposition to nuclear power and his concern, interest and expertise in these issues, but I think he has gone too far in impugning the integrity of the chief nuclear inspector. I am not a scientist, but I have had a number of meetings with Dr Weightman, and I am absolutely convinced that he is an entirely independent, well respected professional. Indeed, he is so well respected that after I asked him to conduct the inquiry and make his recommendations, he was subsequently approached by the International Atomic Energy Agency to lead the international inquiry into Fukushima. It beggars belief not to recognise his standing in the international community and his independence. This is a fact-based and evidence-based report. My concern has always been to base our policy on the facts and the evidence, and I think that the report does that.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.1/2">The hon. Gentleman raised two specific points. He will find that I entirely agree with him on extreme weather events. It is absolutely essential that all our critical energy infrastructure needs to be proof against such events, not just the nuclear facilities. On page 97 of the report, he will find a useful table that summarises the extent to which our existing nuclear power stations are prepared against seismic hazards and flood heights. The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s description of our vulnerability on this front simply does not accord with the facts as set out in Dr Weightman&#8217;s report. First and foremost, we do not have the same reactor design. Secondly, we are not subject to earthquakes of anything like the same</p>
	<p pid="b.344.1/3">magnitude. The earthquake that so unfortunately hit Japan was 65,000 times stronger than the largest earthquake ever recorded in British territorial areas, which was centred on Dogger Bank in 1931. The situation is therefore entirely different. The hon. Gentleman will also see a discussion in the report about the vulnerability to tsunamis, and about whether the flood defence heights set out for each of the power stations on page 97 are adequate, and the conclusions stand.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.1/4">I entirely take the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about the importance of security against terrorist attack. This Government have been very careful to improve the security arrangements in our nuclear facilities since we came into office a little over a year ago, and we will continue to do so.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.353.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40231" speakername="Jim Murphy" colnum="353"  time="013:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0001.htm#11051871001524">
	<p pid="b.353.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State both for his statement and for providing advance sight of it. I join him in paying tribute to all our forces operating our deterrent and their families, and to our skilled civilian work force who help to build and maintain our defence capabilities. Let me also stress once again that where the Government do the right thing on defence policy, we will, in the national interest, support them.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.0/2">Britain&#8217;s independent deterrent has been the cornerstone of our peace and security for over half a century, and our view is that, in today&#8217;s world, as long as there are other countries with such capability it is right that the UK retains an independent nuclear deterrent. In what will be a detailed debate on the military, technical and financial aspects of today&#8217;s announcement, there is a careful judgment to be made: whether we believe the threats posed to our nation and our interests to be such that we are more secure with the UK having our own independent deterrent. Most of us believe in a world free of nuclear weapons and a multilateral process to achieve that, whereas others take a different and unilateralist view, born of a myriad of traditions such as faith, passivism, political commitment or concerns about costs. I respect all those views but take a different approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.0/3">The previous Government met their commitment in the December 2006 White Paper to reduce the number of operationally available warheads to fewer than 160, meaning that the UK has reduced its nuclear arsenal by 75% since the end of the cold war. We welcome this Government&#8217;s announcements in the strategic defence and security review to reduce the number of operationally available warheads and the overall weapons stockpile. We will continue strongly to advocate the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Its three pillars&#8212;non-proliferation, disarmament and the right to use civil nuclear power peacefully&#8212;provide the framework around which we should base our policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.0/4">The greatest nuclear threats we face today come from proliferation and unilateral armament, specifically from North Korea, which we know has a nuclear capability, and Iran, which we know has nuclear ambitions. The most robust response to those threats is for the UK to</p>
	<p pid="b.353.0/5">remain committed to the NPT and to be an active disarmer, alongside our allies and other nuclear weapons states. Maintaining our independent deterrent as part of international non-proliferation efforts is therefore vital in enabling us to combat the threats we face at home, and to sustain regional and global security.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.0/6">I now wish to deal with some specific questions about the review announced today. In 2007, Parliament took the view that it would support the position set out by the previous Government in the 2006 White Paper of replacing the current Vanguard class submarines and maintaining an independent, continuous at-sea submarine-based nuclear deterrent. The decision then was based on evidence and military advice. The Government have announced today that as we move towards main gate there is logic in looking again at some of the defence capability and financial issues relating to how best to maintain a credible, minimum, independent nuclear deterrent. It is important that this is an open process. What is crucial is that the process is evidence-based and in the interests of national security, and that it is not, on occasion, driven by the dynamic within the coalition parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.0/7">I wish to ask the Secretary of State some specific questions. Will the review look at the Government&#8217;s procurement policy in this Parliament for materials for successor submarines? Will the review look at international co-operation over nuclear policy, including deeper co-operation with France above and beyond the agreements made in the UK-France defence co-operation treaty, which we welcomed? Finally, on the review, can he confirm that the Minister for the Armed Forces is a one-man ministerial review team?</p>
	<p pid="b.353.0/8">It was announced in the SDSR that initial gate was due to take place by the end of 2010. Can the Secretary of State tell us the reason for the delay and how much it will add to the cost of the programme over its lifetime? He said there were &#163;500 million of costs for long lead items. Can he say what these items are? Can he say what the total cost of the replacement programme will be, and over what period? He made some comments about that, but can he also say from which budgets the overall costs will be met? Can he say whether both the running and construction costs will come from the core defence budget, and whether he has any estimate on the impact that may have on other equipment programmes?</p>
	<p pid="b.353.0/9">The SDSR stated that the Government would reduce the costs of the successor programme by a total of &#163;3.2 billion over the next 10 years. Can the Secretary of State say whether that takes into account the &#163;1.2 billion to &#163;1.4 billion additional costs of extending the life of the Vanguard class submarines in service until 2028? What reassurances has he been given that extending the life of the Vanguard class submarines is indeed safe? Can he make it clear how much is being spent on the new PWR3 reactors, and over what period?</p>
	<p pid="b.353.0/10">In conclusion, Labour remains committed to a minimum, credible, independent nuclear deterrent, and we welcome the announcements made today by the Government. This decision will have an impact on our nation and beyond for decades to come, and it is crucial that government finds additional ways to involve Parliament in the decision-making process. Labour will always do what is right for the UK&#8217;s defence and national interests, and the country would expect the Government to continue to do the same.</p>

	<p pid="b.355.0/1">I shall do my best to answer the long list of questions that the right hon. Gentleman asked. I shall check <i>Hansard</i>, and if I have missed any I shall write to him with further details.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/2">May I thank the right hon. Gentleman for the Opposition&#8217;s support for the principle of this policy? Cross-party support adds greatly to the credibility of our deterrence policy, which is an essential part of the protection of our country. He rightly says that the major proliferation risk at the moment comes from North Korea and Iran. We do not know whether other countries will join in that so, as he says, it is entirely prudent to retain a minimum, independent, credible nuclear deterrent for the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman asked a number of specific questions about costs. The costs of the various items were set out in the 2006 White Paper, when they were broadly split into: &#163;11 billion to &#163;14 billion for the submarine; &#163;2 billion to &#163;3 billion for the warhead; and &#163;2 billion to &#163;3 billion for infrastructure. We believe that those costs are still contained in the programme itself. He asked specifically about long lead items, on which, as I said in my statement, approximately &#163;500 million will be spent. They include: the specialised high-grade steel; the main boat systems, such as the computer systems, hydraulic systems and atmospheric systems, the generators and the communications systems; and specialist components, including steam generators and test rigs for the propulsion plants.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/4">On our wider international co-operation, we continue to work, as we set out in our treaty with France, on the capabilities required constantly to maintain the safety of our warheads. There are no plans for collaboration on deployment of a deterrent that goes beyond the treaty that has been signed. Agreement with the United States on the major parameters of the jointly developed common missile compartment design, which will be capable of carrying the Trident D5 missiles and any replacement once the D5 reaches the end of its life in the 2040s, has been a major part of our cost containment during the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman asked about the overall costs of the programme. As I said, &#163;3 billion of those will fall between now and 2016. The costs for the years that fall within the current comprehensive spending review are met by the current defence budget settlement. He asked about the life and costs of the Vanguard class submarines. Our assessment when we undertook the value-for-money study was that we could extend Vanguard&#8217;s life to 2028 without having huge additional maintenance and upgrade costs, and while preserving our continuous at-sea deterrent&#8212;CASD. To go beyond 2028 would almost certainly have huge cost implications and may have implications for CASD that we are not willing to undertake. Those were the reasons we took the overall decision, and I hope that I have answered the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s specific questions.</p>

	<p pid="b.356.1/1">On costs, does the Secretary of State accept that since the election two things, effectively, have gone on? Savings have been made as a result of the joint missile compartment and the reduction in the number of war heads, but those savings have been completely wiped out by the political decision demanded by the Liberal Democrats to extend the procurement period beyond the next election. I would have thought that those political decisions have led to costs approaching &#163;2.5 billion, if one takes into account the necessity to build an additional Astute class submarine just to keep Barrow going. One might think that in the circumstances faced by the Secretary of State this might not have been his priority, what with all the other cuts he was making and the additional maintenance round that will now be needed for the existing fleet. How much more additional cost will there be as a result of the separate review? In a Department in which we are bearing down on manpower and reducing the skills available, we are now applying the skill base to an ongoing, second round assessment and review.</p>

	<p pid="b.358.0/1">This has always been at the heart of the deterrent argument. The whole point is that there is uncertainty about the circumstances in which the United Kingdom would respond, and the system therefore acts as a proper deterrent. We would hope that such weapons would never have to be used because they would deter any threat against us. That is the principle and the core of the issue and it is something that the unilateralists never understood.</p>

	<p pid="b.358.2/1">We have a number of ways of ensuring the protection of our deterrent and, as my hon. Friend says, he would not expect me to go into it. As for the Nimrod MRA4 programme, to which he might be referring, I must remind him that that capability was not available to us because the programme was already nine years late and the aircraft had not flown other than in one test that was abandoned for safety reasons. I am afraid that the failure of procurement over a number of years made that capability unavailable today.</p>

	<p pid="b.360.5/1">I do not think that having a nuclear deterrent does anything to diminish the status of the United Kingdom but our ability to influence world events is a combination of a range of things including military power, economic power and diplomatic power, all of which we exercise in the furtherance of our national interests.</p>

In putting forward the proposals we believe not only that we are providing a safe future for the United Kingdom by maintaining our deterrent but that in reducing the number of warheads we have, we are setting our direction very clearly towards a world in which we hope to see the elimination, over time, of this wider threat from weapons of mass destruction.</p>

	<p pid="b.365.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require the Secretary of State to make provision requiring the fitting of equipment to heavy goods vehicles to eliminate driver blind spots; to make other provisions relating to the safety of cyclists, pedestrians and other road users; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/3">The Bill is about saving the lives of vulnerable road users, particularly cyclists but also pedestrians and others. The particular vulnerability that it deals with is caused by blind spots on heavy goods vehicles. It is a problem that is particularly acute in city traffic, especially at junctions. The problem is likely to increase as cycling becomes ever more popular as a means of getting to work in urban areas and for leisure, and as lorries get bigger.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/4">A daughter of a constituent of mine lost her life in a collision with a tipper truck. Eilidh Cairns was cycling from her home in Kentish Town to her work in Chiswick. She had cycled this route daily for three years and she was an experienced cyclist. She was caught up under the wheels of the lorry, probably because its front bumper made contact with her rear wheel. The coroner described it as a</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/5">&#8220;terrible, terrible tragedy that unfortunately is not an uncommon occurrence here in London where a cyclist and a large vehicle come into contact with each other, and invariably the cyclist will suffer very serious or fatal injuries&#8230; It&#8217;s a huge problem that I think the Government, cyclists and safer cycling groups are going to be grappling with for quite a considerable time&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/6">The purpose of the Bill is to encourage the Government to grapple with that problem in order to safe lives, and using mirrors or technical means to eliminate drivers&#8217; blind spots on HGVs is a vital weapon in doing so.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/7">After her death, Eilidh&#8217;s family and friends set up the &#8220;See me, Save me&#8221; campaign, which has gained massive support. It shares a name with a motorcycling safety campaign that similarly seeks to secure greater road safety. In the European Parliament, my colleague Fiona Hall MEP tabled a written declaration on the issue and well over half of all MEPs&#8212;more than 400&#8212;have put their names to it. This means that the Commission must produce proposals to deal with the issue, probably by revising an existing directive so that newly-registered HGVs will have effective means of eliminating blind spots, emergency braking and lane departure warning systems.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/8">Here at home, the Transport Secretary last week published a road safety consultation document with a short section on vehicle technology. It stressed a preference for voluntary compliance rather than regulation. On some issues I would share that preference, but on this issue I think regulation is needed, first because the problem remains so serious, and secondly to ensure that hauliers who want to invest in good technology do not feel that they will be undercut by those who are unwilling to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/9">In fact, the costs to a haulage business of involvement in a fatal accident are substantial, including the loss of a driver&#8217;s services for a long period, the disrupting</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/10">insurance, legal and other costs, and potentially compensation costs. The cost to the economy is massive. According to the Department for Transport, fatal accidents cost on average more than &#163;1,750,000. The cost of better mirrors and technical additions would be very small in comparison to the huge cost of a new HGV. Fitting such technology to older vehicles could at least be achieved on a gradual basis, at a cost of around &#163;700 on present estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/11">Clearly it is best for these measures to be introduced across Europe, because HGVs travel all over the continent and our roads see numerous haulage vehicles from other European countries. For British hauliers, it would be much better if their competitors from continental Europe were subject to the same requirements as they are. Although the Bill would give our Transport Secretary powers to make regulations for the fitting of equipment to vehicles, its underlying purpose is to demonstrate that Parliament wants to see the British Government actively involved in securing Europe-wide regulations and not holding back. I am glad that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40308" name="Michael Penning">the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase>, who has responsibility for roads, has been present throughout my speech to hear this case.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/12">Other safety provisions could be incorporated in the Bill, and it will be drafted in such a way as to allow this. The details of its provisions can be examined carefully if the House allows it to be brought in and gives it a fair wind. I have found very ready support across the House for the Bill; the list of sponsors was filled up to the limit within an hour or so of it becoming known to the House and many more hon. and right hon. Members would have liked to have added their names. The all-party group on cycling has been particularly supportive of the campaign, as have a number of newspapers&#8212;<i>The Independent</i>, the <i>Evening Standard</i> and the <i>Newcastle Journal</i> have all given it substantial coverage.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/13">Coroners&#8217; verdicts often refer to the deaths of cyclists in the circumstances I have described as accidental deaths, which is much resented by many of the families involved. They feel very strongly that &#8220;accident&#8221; implies something that was beyond control or prevention. It also seems to preclude culpability where a driver has ignored the fact that he cannot see an area of road on to which his vehicle is encroaching. RoadPeace, the national charity for road crash victims, is pressing for the word &#8220;accident&#8221; not to be used in future for road crashes or collisions. The case that we are putting today is that many collisions that lead to the deaths of cyclists and other vulnerable road users could be prevented. We should not miss the opportunity to call for practical measures to save lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/14" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/15" class="italic">Ordered,</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/16">That Sir Alan Beith, Dr Julian Huppert, Mr James Arbuthnot, Meg Munn, Naomi Long, Sir Peter Bottomley, Andrea Leadsom, Jeremy Corbyn, Tom Brake, Mr Don Foster, Fabian Hamilton and Natascha Engel present the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/17">Sir Alan Beith accordingly presented the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.2/18" class="italic">Bill read the First time; to be read a Second time on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-09">Friday 9 September</phrase>, and to be printed (Bill 191).</p>

	<p pid="b.368.0/1">We are dealing with part 7 of the Bill, which relates to governance in Greater London, and part 3, which relates largely to business rate matters and, I am delighted to say, has not proven controversial. I hope that part 7 will not detain us terribly long either, as a good degree of consensus was achieved in Committee and there are just one or two matters that it is necessary to debate further.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.0/2">I will start with new clause 21, the lead provision in the group, and the majority of associated matters. With the exception of only two topics that I will come to in a moment, the rest of the group comprises a large number of technical amendments relating to two tax issues. Although the new clause is the first new clause listed on the amendment paper, it is not really the natural starting point, so perhaps I will be forgiven if I leapfrog over it to new clause 20, which will amend the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and require the Greater London authority to undertake certain specified activities for a commercial purpose through a taxable body. It relates to the transfer of a large number of functions of the Housing Corporation in London to the Mayor, to the movement of the London Development Agency into the GLA&#8217;s main body and to the establishment of mayoral development corporations in London. All of those potentially involve commercial activity, so we have to get the tax treatment right.</p>

	<p pid="b.368.2/1">I am grateful, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.2/2">I will encapsulate the technicalities as swiftly as I can, but it suffices to say that these amendments are necessary to ensure that those commercial activities that are undertaken by the GLA are done so within a taxable environment. As a local authority, it would normally have tax-exempt status, but some of those activities are not of a local authority nature but more of a commercial nature and so have to be properly taxable. There is a long-established tax principle in that regard to ensure a level playing field between the public and private sectors in relation to commercial activities. That is particularly important in this case because the GLA will inherit, as a consequence of our devolution measures, a significant portfolio of land interests, some of which operate on a commercial basis and are subject to corporation tax and capital gains tax. It is not a new state of affairs. Section 157 of the 1999 Act made light provision in relation to the activities of Transport for London. That is the background to what we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.2/3">In a nutshell, the list of specified commercial activities, which will be set out in a detailed order, will be worked up by Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs and the</p>
	<p pid="b.368.2/4">GLA during the passage of the Bill, but essentially the activities of the London Development Agency and Homes and Communities Agency will be transferred to the Mayor. That is how new clause 20 kicks off the whole proposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.2/5">New clause 21 introduces new schedule 2, which will neutralise certain tax consequences&#8212;the other side of the coin&#8212;that might otherwise arise from the transfer of various property, rights and liabilities from the Office for Tenants and Social Landlords, the Homes and Communities Agency and the London Development Agency to other public bodies. There is a measure to enable the Treasury to make similar tax provisions for future mayoral development corporations. As we know, one is proposed, and we will come to that in a moment, but the provision will technically permit others to be set up and, therefore, embrace properly, within a legal framework, all those related activities.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.2/6">Essentially, every Government new clause and amendment with which we are concerned relates to that process. The Opposition have tabled a couple of amendments, which I can deal with conveniently either now or in due course once they have been spoken to, but suffice it to say that the only Government amendments that do not form part of the tax treatment provisions are amendments 212 and 213. They relate to the mayoral development corporation, which is proposed for establishment, and I hope that we can find some common ground, because in Committee there was a discussion and Members generally accepted as desirable both the idea that the Mayor of London should have the power to establish a mayoral development corporation, and the current Mayor&#8217;s intention to establish such a corporation broadly relating to the Olympic park in east London.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.2/7">The provision is more widely cast than that, for good reasons, and it will permit the establishment of other mayoral development corporations. None is envisaged by the current Mayor and I am not conscious of any envisaged by potential Mayors, either, but it would be on the books for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.2/8">The question that arose, and which the Government seek to address with the proposed changes, was what are the appropriate means of holding the Mayor to account for mayoral development corporation proposals. If a future Mayor&#8212;I am sure that it would not be the current Mayor&#8212;were to come up with a proposal for a mayoral development corporation which was thought objectionable, by what means would a control or brake be put on that process?</p>

	<p pid="b.372.0/1">Setting aside the sui generis nature of London governance, does my hon. Friend agree that the level of direct accountability of these Government proposals is greater than that which existed hitherto in, for instance, West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, North Northants Development Corporation and most of, if not all of, the housing market renewal areas? This is indeed an improvement in terms of direct accountability for regeneration policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.372.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right for two reasons. First, the power to set up the corporation is devolved, and a directly elected regional figure, in the shape of the Mayor, takes that decision. Secondly, there is the veto, which did not exist in relation to the other, earlier-style development corporations. There is therefore a significantly enhanced degree of accountability.</p>

	<p pid="b.372.2/1">I heard what the Minister said about the discussions that have been going on in east London between the Mayor and the local authorities. If, for example, the current Mayor or any future Mayor had the further idea that there should be mayoral development corporations south of the river, would that, of necessity, require him to have the agreement of the local authority or authorities in question if they had a different view, given that there could be a conflict? Co-operation is fine, but a difference of view that means that the local authority&#8217;s views were disregarded is not so fine.</p>

	<p pid="b.375.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the two amendments in my name, although it feels rather strange to be doing so when we have already had much of the debate. I will speak to amendment 351, which relates to the establishment of a London housing and regeneration board, and seeks to guarantee that at least 50% of the membership of such a board would be made up of representatives from the local authority. I will also speak to amendment 352, which we have already debated at some length, and which relates to the process that has to be gone through to establish a mayoral development corporation. Under the amendment, the agreement of any council that is affected would be required before an MDC could be established. I am conscious that there is much to debate this afternoon, so I will limit my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.0/2">I will move on to why I tabled the amendments. I should say at the outset that the amendments have been promoted and supported by London Councils, which, as hon. Members know, is the cross-party organisation that represents London boroughs. We can debate the localist merits of the Bill as a whole, but the provisions on London are distinctly regionalist. Whereas in other parts of the country there is the abolition of regional spatial strategies, we still have the London plan. The Bill proposes the winding up of the London Development Agency and the London part of the Homes and Communities Agency, with their powers being transferred to the London Mayor. Due to the Government&#8217;s understandable desire to ensure that the regeneration legacy of the Olympics takes effect, there are proposals in the Bill to enable the Mayor to set up a mayoral development corporation. However, as drafted, the Bill suggests that there could be an MDC anywhere in London, and not just at the Olympics site. My amendments would act as a brake on the concentrating powers that the Bill puts into the hands of the Mayor of London.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.0/3">They would give councils and councillors a voice, and they would give people in London the same say as people elsewhere in the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.0/4">Amendment 352 would make it a requirement that a local authority in a proposed MDC area must agree to its establishment. If more that one local authority is affected, all must agree. The Bill gives complete power to the Mayor and the Secretary of State. Under Government amendment 213, the support of two thirds of the assembly will be needed for a proposal to move forward. That is not a sufficient assurance. There could be a situation in London in which local people are completely against the setting up of an MDC, councillors and the local authority in the area are completely against the setting up of an MDC, and the GLA constituency member is completely against the setting up of an MDC, and yet if the Mayor wants it to happen, it will happen. I ask hon. Members, what is localist about that?</p>
	<p pid="b.375.0/5">We had some fun in Committee. On Second Reading, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> talked about the prospect of a new Mayor of London&#8212;perhaps Ken Livingstone in a year&#8217;s time&#8212;choosing to establish a mayoral development corporation in Bromley. I will not repeat those comments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.380.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="380"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0002.htm#11051871001620">
	<p pid="b.380.1/1">I shall not help the House to hold a seminar on London in the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, which would actually be very interesting. The hon. Gentleman is nevertheless right. Local authorities did not get on with development. There were frozen developments, including one in the Royal Docks and some in my constituency, after the closure of the London docks in the upper pool in places like Bermondsey, and their move down to Tilbury. That is why the Government intervened, and I understand why they did so. It was necessary to get something moving. Whatever else we say about it, the LDDC certainly did that. Its legacy has, in general terms, been very benign. The regeneration has been hugely successful. Southwark is as prosperous as it is, and the business rates that are collected in Southwark are as high as they are, because of the regeneration along the riverside from London bridge down to the end of my constituency at the other side of the Greenland dock, on the border with Deptford.</p>
	<p pid="b.380.1/2">To pursue the housing and jobs theme, it is clear that there are huge opportunities for employment-regenerative activities in inner-London boroughs if the conditions&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.380.1/3">meaning rate relief, sites and so on&#8212;are right. I visited the Tower Bridge Business Centre in my constituency just the other day, which is on the site of the old Peek Freans factory in Bermondsey. That hugely successful, privately owned enterprise provides a nursery and units of various sizes for people as they grow their businesses. It is one of a set of businesses run by the same company around Greater London, where it does all its business. It has very innovative ideas. There is no shortage of individuals, small firms and others that want to come in to take over the spaces that were previously occupied by larger businesses. The large wholesale warehouses and distribution centres, for example, are not in London any more, and we no longer need storage centres because we store on micro-files rather than in paper files.</p>
	<p pid="b.380.1/4">The opportunity for London to continue as a place of employment still exists, and not just in the financial industries of the City. London has fantastic creative industries, small engineering enterprises and so, and we must make the most of these opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.380.1/5">There is a huge need to ensure that we continue to build homes at prices that our constituents can afford. The other day, I met some representatives of the G15 group of London housing associations, which owns the largest number of properties in London&#8212;it is known to all London Members. The G15 is concerned about how the financial picture and envelope will permit them to develop. I undertook to the G15 that I would seek to convene a meeting in June to try to sort out what appears at the moment to be a set of policies that is not yet fully connected. Invited are the Housing and Local Government Minister, who has agreed to attend; Lord Freud, the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions; colleagues from throughout London from all parties; the Mayor, who has shown an interest; local councillors representing the 33 local authorities;, and the housing world. How do we deliver more affordable homes, particularly the larger homes with three or four bedrooms for families, and deliver on the Government&#8217;s general approach to welfare without making it impossible for people to stay in the sorts of homes that we want them to be in? I hope we can join up that remaining part of the policy, and I welcome the advice of the hon. Member for Lewisham East, who has experience of the matter. I will work with her colleagues and Conservative colleagues, and I am sure that we can make further progress. I also welcome the fact that the Mayor is taking a direct interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.380.1/6">The proposals in this group are about further transfers of power to the Mayor. As a veteran of both the legislation to the abolish the Greater London council, which I opposed, and the legislation to set up the Greater London authority, which I supported, I believe that more powers should be given to London government from central Government. Indeed, the difficulties that the Government have run into on other policies&#8212;for example, on the NHS&#8212;could have been less had they accepted our advice. I and my hon. Friends argued and voted for amendments on transferring strategic health powers to London government, for example, because it is better to get rid of unaccountable quangos and regional bodies and to replace them with accountable regional bodies.</p>

	<p pid="b.382.2/1">I stand rebuked, Mr Deputy Speaker. I was tempted by the right hon. Gentleman, but I will not be anymore. I will make a few more comments, and then sit down.</p>
	<p pid="b.382.2/2">The next issue is how exactly the transfer of powers back to London will work. It is certainly right that, as the Bill proposes, we get rid of the London function of the Homes and Communities Agency, which is a quango, and transfer it to a democratically elected Mayor answerable to the 25 elected members of the London assembly. That is a good thing. It is also certainly right that the Government abolish the Government office for London. There is no need for a Government office for London as well as a Mayor, a London assembly and a Greater London authority. All those policies are heading in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.382.2/3">We now need to solve the further dilemma of how we strike the right balance between London-wide decisions, which are perfectly proper, and the interests of the boroughs. I understand that there is still some unresolved tension in that regard. My colleagues on the London assembly and across London think that, on balance, the Government are heading in the right direction, so today, although obviously the hon. Member for Lewisham East is entitled to make her case, we cannot support her. However, I do not want her to take that to mean that there are not further conversations to be had. Obviously the Bill will go to the House of Lords, and there will be opportunities to look at these things afresh.</p>
	<p pid="b.382.2/4">I am hopeful that today&#8217;s debate will flag up the need to ensure&#8212;I am happy to have further conversations with colleagues about this&#8212;that the new architecture is the right architecture. I heard clearly what the Minister said about the Mayor&#8217;s power being subject to the two-thirds support of the London assembly, and I agree that that amounts to a requirement for a cross-party endorsement or cross-party veto. That will be a welcome control mechanism. I do not criticise the fact that the representatives, particularly the constituency representatives, should be able to speak for their constituencies, including for the borough councils within those constituencies, which is one of their jobs.</p>

	<p pid="b.384.0/1">I am pleased to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>. It goes without saying that I support the Government amendments. The Bill will disturb the equilibrium that we established in 1998 and the settled view of London governance. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">The right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase> piloted the legislation on this matter through Parliament. I had the pleasure&#8212;generally speaking&#8212;of serving with him in the last Parliament on several Bill Committees, but in some respects he is resiling from earlier commitments. His proposals opposing the Government amendments and the views expressed ably and articulately by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40363" name="Heidi Alexander">the hon. Member for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander)</phrase> seek effectively to undermine the authority and autonomy of the boroughs. They would set up an institutionalised conflict between the boroughs and the Greater London authority, with the Mayor quite possibly acting as the de facto referee and invigilator. That is a serious concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.0/2">On the hon. Lady&#8217;s amendment 351, we should acknowledge the consensus in the House on the need for more affordable housing, better quality housing and aesthetically pleasing housing, and above all for regeneration to consolidate London&#8217;s position as the pre-eminent city in Europe. However, looking at what was delivered in the dozen or so years of the regional development agencies, when we had a centralised policy, and an over-prescriptive and&#8212;one may even say&#8212;draconian approach to housing targets, I am not convinced that instituting a pan-London borough body would achieve the key objectives that we all seek.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.0/3">I mentioned earlier, albeit perhaps in a slightly irreverent way, that for eight years while I was a London borough councillor, I served on bodies that were largely non-political. To get agreement on waste transfer and ecology centres was difficult enough, so making value judgments as between different boroughs and in effect resiling from a strategic overview of what is good for a whole city or region probably would not work. Incidentally, I have to disabuse my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40190" name="Gavin Barwell">the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell)</phrase> of one notion. Peterborough is, in fact, the greatest city in the world, but we might have to beg to differ on that. However, with all due respect to the hon. Member for Lewisham East, while my heart agrees with her, my head says that her proposals probably would not work or deliver what we wish.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.0/4">Let me briefly address the Government amendments and the points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" name="Barbara Keeley">the hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley)</phrase> and the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich. As the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark said, we would be returning to something like the situation that prevailed with the London Docklands Development Corporation, with the Secretary of State required to make the value judgment that the neither the boroughs nor the GLA could sort something out, and would therefore impose a regeneration body. We have moved on from that. We now have a more mature and nuanced political culture. Once we establish the bona fides of London governance through the GLA and the Mayor, with the proviso that there will effectively be a two-thirds veto for the directly elected individuals,</p>
	<p pid="b.384.0/5">who will debate among themselves and with their boroughs, it would seem invidious to undermine that by putting so much potential power&#8212;again, effectively in the form of a veto&#8212;in the hands of the Mayor.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.0/6">On that basis, I would urge Ministers&#8212;and in particular the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase>&#8212;to reject the Opposition&#8217;s views and to make the case strongly. What we have is the best consensual way forward to ensure that we get what we all want, which is better quality housing in London and for the economic engine driving the south-east and the wider country to be a success. That is why I support the Government amendments.</p>

	<p pid="b.385.1/1">This has been an interesting and worthwhile debate, although I accept that there has been an element of d&#233;j&#224; vu for some of us. I say that as someone who served on the old Greater London council and who found its abolition quite painless, partly because at the same time I was serving on the fire authority, the waste regulation authority, the waste disposal authority and the borough council. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40479" name="Stewart Jackson">the Member for Peterborough (Mr Jackson)</phrase> is quite right that we created a somewhat convoluted architecture thereafter, which is why it is right to restore as much decision making as we can to London. That is why I am grateful for his support for the general thrust of where we are going.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.1/2">I understand the point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40363" name="Heidi Alexander">the hon. Member for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander)</phrase> made about the importance of employment and housing. She is absolutely right about that. I also accept the need to take all the agencies in London along with any such proposal, but I cannot accept her proposition that we cannot trust London&#8217;s politicians to come to a mature decision on the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.1/3">A powerful point about the history of London was made by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40190" name="Gavin Barwell">the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell)</phrase>, and it was also reinforced by my hon. Friend the Member for Peterborough. They all have long experience in London government. Their point was that there are some details that can be looked at, but it is important to recognise that the relationship between the Mayor and the assembly has matured, even in the short time that the assembly has been in existence. Indeed, the relationship between the Mayor and the boroughs has matured regardless of party, under Mayors of both principal parties, as it happens. We should not underestimate the brokerage and leverage role that exists in the system, in addition to a purely legalistic role.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.1/4">If I may be permitted to mention one bit of history, something that we learned from the previous GLC is that it was not simply the disagreements of Ken Livingstone with the Government of the day that undermined the GLC. Rather, the GLC was undermined by the tension between the two tiers and the risk, on occasion, of impasse&#8212;impasse that arose regardless of the party controlling the GLC and the London boroughs at the time. That is my concern. Giving boroughs an absolute veto in the way suggested by amendment 352 risks recreating the tensions of the old GLC days, rather than the more collaborative working that we currently have.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.1/5">The proposal put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark also referred, is a sensible one. We can consider the details and discuss them sensibly to find a way to take it forward. We have learned from the rather remote model of operation of the earlier development corporations, and we want to embed that learning in how we go forward in future.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.1/6">Even at this late stage, I hope that the Opposition will think about the necessity of pressing their amendment 352 to a vote. However, if they really insist, I would ask the House to reject it.</p>

	<p pid="b.406.4/1">Fortunately, I do not have to take responsibility for the actions of that body&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;You do!&#8221;] Let us be quite clear that letters can be sent out by anyone to anyone saying anything. However, they are only enforceable if they are consistent with the tenure standards set by the regulator and with the housing strategy derived from them. Registered providers will need to have in place a tenancy policy that is published and drawn up in consultation with tenants. It sounds to me very much as though the letter to which the hon. Lady refers has been sent in advance of any of those things being in place. It is therefore of no value or significance other than that it does something that concerns me a great deal about our debate on this issue&#8212;that is, it serves to whip up misunderstanding and fear among existing tenants that in some way they might be affected by these new proposals. That is absolutely not the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.406.5/1">I thank the Minister for giving way, as he is being very generous. I think the answer to the question from my constituency neighbour, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase>, is that clearly somebody who has had a 10-year tenancy and brought up their family can find that when their circumstances change they lose their home. These are homes that people invest in; they are not simple utilitarian houses.</p>

	<p pid="b.407.0/1">The tenure standards will set that out, the housing strategy of the local housing authority will reinforce it and the tenancy policy of the provider, if it is not the housing authority itself, will also set it out.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/2">I want to make some progress and move on to a second issue that is, I know, of real concern to Members: the provisions on homelessness. Much of the debate on our homelessness proposals started off from the proposition that private rented landlords are a rogue sector and incapable of offering decent quality accommodation to those families who might benefit from it. I made it clear in Committee, as has my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government on a number of occasions, that the draft legislation includes a number of safeguards that together provide reassurances that an offer of private accommodation would be made only when it is reasonable to do so and when the accommodation is suitable for the needs of the household.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/3">It is important to go back to why we are making the changes in the first place. It is not because we want to make the plight of homeless families worse, but because we want to make their situation better. In London, the average stay in temporary accommodation of resettled homeless families before they get a permanent offer of social home accommodation is two years. The impact of that time on schooling, quality of life, health and stress is not acceptable and needs to be tackled. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40655" name="Karen Buck">the hon. Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck)</phrase> that this probably is not a countrywide problem, and I suspect that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40132" name="Gordon Birtwistle">the Member for Burnley (Gordon Birtwistle)</phrase> does not have the problem because he has 2,500 empty houses to begin with, but in places of high housing stress it is a real problem. That is why we are making these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/4">In Committee and elsewhere, hon. Members have raised a number of concerns about the homelessness measures. Some of those focused on standards of accommodation in the private rented sector, the interplay that there might be with housing benefit changes and related issues of affordability. There were also concerns about the location of those private rented sector homes and whether there might be some loophole in creating intentional homelessness. I want to respond to each of those points in due course.</p>

	<p pid="b.411.3/1">Yes. It is important that we review the guidance&#8212;I just said that we should do so&#8212;and it would be an unusual local authority that disregarded it. I undertake to reflect further on the best way forward, and I hope that my hon. Friends and the hon. Gentleman feel that that is a step forward which allows them not to press their amendments today.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.3/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40388" name="John Leech">the Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr Leech)</phrase> has tabled new clause 26, which relates to a specific situation for fully mutual housing co-operatives.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.3/3">By a quirk of the legislation, they are caught by the houses in multiple occupation requirement for licensing and, sometimes, planning permission. The Department has been lobbied by the Friendly Housing Action campaign group to secure an exemption for fully mutual housing co-operatives, and I am very sympathetic to the campaign, as such organisations were never intended to be caught by the licensing provisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.3/4">We have to be careful to ensure that in granting an exemption we do not inadvertently allow other categories to slip through the loophole, so I am asking for further advice on how we might achieve that. I hope to return to the issue at a later stage, so I hope that my hon. Friends will not feel the need to press new clause 26 to a Division.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.3/5">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" name="Alison Seabeck">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> for new clauses 25 and 24, which she and her hon. Friends have tabled. They both relate to cases in which courts made decisions that the common-sense man would not have expected. New clause 25 refers to a situation in which the housing allocation scheme was perverted&#8212;I think that is the right word&#8212;by an officer, and consequently the courts decided that, because of the nature of the current legislation, it was not possible to recover the properties that had been misallocated. I am certainly minded to take some steps in the right direction. The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government recently launched a 10-point plan for tackling council fraud, and that included vetting staff. I hope that that means that it is very unlikely that the situation will recur, but we are going to look at how we might move forward. On a rather significant technical point, the place where Opposition Members have chosen to insert the words means that the provision would apply only to Wales; I suspect that that is not what they really meant to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.3/6">New clause 24 deals with a situation where a death was concealed at the transfer of a tenancy and therefore a vital time line was missed and it then proved impossible to correct that. The new clause changes the time limit restrictions so that when a local authority seeks to repossess a property, the date at which it became aware of the change in circumstances, rather than the actual date of the circumstances, will be relevant. I fully accept the point drawn to our attention. We will explore the issue in more detail and talk to various local authorities and representative bodies with a view to tabling a Government amendment in the other place. I hope that the hon. Lady feels that that is a helpful way for us to proceed.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.3/7">I cannot be so consensual on other amendments tabled by the Opposition. I do not want to detain the House unduly, but I must say that we have a considerable mixture of amendments of one type or another, to which I will perhaps respond to in my final 16 seconds, if that is how it turns out. Some of them are direct negatives of our proposals in the Bill, some are wrecking amendments to one degree or another, and some are quite seductive in their tone, if not their impact. Several of them duplicate safeguards that are already in the Bill or even in legislation as it has stood for some time.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.3/8">Some of the amendments seem to be based on an Opposition view that social landlords are even worse than they think private landlords are, with their principal business being to get people out of their homes as quickly as possible. Of course, that is not the primary</p>
	<p pid="b.411.3/9">purpose or intention of social landlords, which is to provide suitable accommodation for those who need it, as will continue to be the situation in future. Other amendments seem to be more about whipping up misunderstanding among vulnerable families than about making a contribution towards solving the heartrending problems of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.3/10">I urge hon. Friends and other Members to support the Government&#8217;s sensible and thoughtful proposals and to reject the many temptations offered by the Opposition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.413.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" speakername="Alison Seabeck" colnum="413"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0003.htm#11051871002226">
	<p pid="b.413.0/1">I repeat the declaration I made at the start of the Public Bill Committee, which is on the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/2">I thank all those involved in Committee proceedings on this large and extensive Bill, including the two very patient Chairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">the hon. Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase>. Although we had well-informed discussions in Committee&#8212;Members on both sides of the House are to be commended&#8212;I am left with the feeling that we could have done with significantly more time to debate the issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/3">Yesterday, the Minister started by saying that the Committee was consensual&#8212;not so on the housing proposals, I am afraid. We debated more than 40 amendments and new clauses on this part of the Bill, and not one was accepted by Government Front Benchers. Although I welcome the moves that the Minister has made today on a couple of our proposals, I do not get a sense that he is giving any ground. Indeed, having listened to his speech and responses, I think he is rather digging in; of course, that is his prerogative.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/4">The Opposition cannot let these proposals go unchallenged. I will therefore speak to amendments 269, 270, 273 to 276 and 360, new clauses 24 and 25, and amendments 13, 14, 271, 272, 277 and 278, which stand in my name and those of my hon. Friends. I flag it up at this stage, given that the Minister has not astounded us with a number of U-turns, that we will press for votes on amendment 13 on flexible tenancies and on amendment 271 on security of tenure.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/5">New clause 19, which will allow local authorities to keep capital receipts relating to right-to-buy sales, is welcomed by the Opposition, although we would like to see more detail. We understand that it involves the removal of the ring fence around the proceeds from sales of land or property in that account. That raises the concern that that money could be moved away from meeting housing need.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/6">The Government&#8217;s proposals on housing and homelessness are deeply damaging, and none more so than the proposal to end security of tenure in social housing. That will create two classes of tenant in social housing. There will be great uncertainty, because there will be different lengths of tenure and different levels of rent, with little rational relationship between the two. There will be a divide between those who have been fortunate enough to get security of tenure in their social housing, and those who have been made to wait for too</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/7">long and will be granted a tenancy for as little as two years. Tenants whose financial circumstances improve above an arbitrary level will potentially be told to pack up and move on.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/8">As a result of the complexity of the system that is being brought forward, which will be a bureaucratic nightmare, a household in a three-bedroom house could pay less rent and have greater security than a household next door in a two-bedroom flat. Frankly, that will be divisive. We all have people who come to our constituency surgeries and say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t understand why so-and-so has higher priority than me.&#8221; These proposals will add a further layer to that and will be problematic.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/9">We heard in the run-up to the announcement on the military covenant&#8212;I digress a little, but this is housing-related&#8212;about how difficult it is for military families to have to move every couple of years. That often happens and I see it a lot at the naval base. Only this week in questions, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40548" name="Andrew Robathan">the right hon. Member for South Leicestershire (Mr Robathan)</phrase>, said that he had spoken with the Minister for Housing and Local Government on this issue. The Under-Secretary of State for Defence, the right hon. Member for South Leicestershire has said in the past that this instability is unacceptable and that soldiers, sailors and airmen need and deserve help to protect the stability of their families&#8217; homes and education.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/10">However, the message from the Department for Communities and Local Government to all families in social housing is, &#8220;Get a better job and you will lose your home. Invite your partner to move in with you and start a family, and you will put your home at risk.&#8221; At a time when we want people to do their best to get on in life, and to build something better for themselves and their families, this is the wrong policy. Labour will stand up for people who strive and who put the hours in to better their lot. What will happen to people who fall foul of the new Tory rules and are told to leave their council or housing association home simply because they have worked hard if they subsequently lose their job or fall ill and are unable to work? What will their entitlement be then? They will go to the back of the queue and start all over again. Where is the incentive to work and where is the fairness?</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/11">In Committee, we received a powerful submission from a young woman called Jessica Sim, who lives in social housing. Her experience will be mirrored by many other tenants. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/12">&#8220;To get an affordable secure home was a great incentive to pursue my career. I also spent a great deal of time and money improving my council home and garden&#8230;and getting involved in my community association to improve the area, knowing that we could stay.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/13">She went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/14">&#8220;What if the people who are kicked out lose their job or get fed up being hardly better off working? Back on housing benefit, back in the queue, the bill will be enormous. Families have a better chance if they have a secure place to live. Moving people on does not solve a shortage of housing.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/15">She rightly identified that to solve the housing crisis, the Government need to build more homes. Their policy seems to be aimed at trying to solve the shortage of social housing by allowing everyone a year or two in a social home before moving them on. Ministers seem to have failed to realise that to house people we need not to give them shorter tenancies but to build homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/16">What will be the consequences of that policy of limiting social housing so that it is not available to those who work hard to build something for themselves, or to those who invest in their homes and communities? What will happen when we reduce estates to being areas that people pass through at their most vulnerable point and transitional communities of the most deprived? We will go back almost to the state of social housing in the first half of the last century, when access to it was limited by law to the &#8220;working classes&#8221;. That term was only ever defined once in legislation, in paragraph (12)(e) of the schedule to the Housing of the Working Classes Act 1903, as those</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/17">&#8220;whose income in any case does not exceed an average of thirty shillings a week&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/18">In today&#8217;s money, that would be an annual income of just over &#163;7,000. Mean as the Government are, I do not expect them to set a threshold as low as that, which would make them comparable with Tory Governments of the late 19th and early 20th century. However, the message that their change will send is the same now as it was then: that social housing is for the poor. It is to segregate people from other sections of society that are seen as doing better.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/19">It has been more than 62 years since the House decided, without a Division, to accept that segregating social housing off for just one deprived section of society was entirely wrong. In that debate, Aneurin Bevan said&#8212;it is as true now as it was then&#8212;that it was</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/20">&#8220;entirely undesirable that on modern housing estates only one type of citizen should live&#8230;that from one sort of township should come one income group and from another sort of township another income group&#8230;if we are to enable citizens to lead a full life, if they are each to be aware of the problems of their neighbours, then they should be all drawn from the different sections of the community&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/21">The principle of mixed communities in social housing, in which the Labour party should take great pride, was welcomed at that time by the Tory Front-Bench spokesman, the Member for Hertford. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/22">&#8220;It is, of course very desirable that the black-coated workers&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/23">administrative workers&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/24">&#8220;should not be shut out from the benefit of local authority housing accommodation.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1949-03-16.2126"><i>Official Report</i>, 16 March 1949; Vol. 462, c. 2126-38</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/25">I am only sorry that the wisdom of Churchillian conservatism, such as it was, has not carried through to coalition Cameronism.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/26">Sixty years on, the idea that this country is stronger when its communities are more diverse, and that its society is more cohesive when it comprises of a broad and mixed swathe of people, is no longer supported by the Conservative party. Nor is it supported by the Liberal party, whose MPs did not oppose the measures in this Bill in Committee despite trying to raise their concerns by tabling amendments. They consistently withdrew those amendments without a vote. Just where is their fabled voice in government and their backbone? We still believe in mixed communities in social housing, underpinned by security of tenure, which the Bill targets so directly.</p>

	<p pid="b.416.4/1">If the right hon. Gentleman will allow me, I shall address some of those points later in my speech. I find the Liberal Democrat position quite extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.4/2">The Liberal Democrat manifesto said nothing on the issue, and as I pointed out, the Housing and Local Government Minister, who is sadly no longer in the Chamber&#8212;he obviously has more interesting things to do than listen to a debate on housing&#8212;said that</p>
	<p pid="b.416.4/3">&#8220;there is no chance of, or way in which, a social tenancy can be broken or changed for anybody already in council or housing association homes.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-02-28.19"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 February 2011; Vol. 524, c. 19</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.416.4/4">In November, I asked the Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the right hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase> whether he would give me his personal guarantee that secure tenancy rights would not be changed. He gave a brief, direct answer: &#8220;Yes.&#8221; If only the Bill that those Ministers now promote were consistent with their previous statements in the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.4/5">The framework published by the Department is quite clear that tenancies will be secure only for tenants who have a secure tenancy before <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-31">31 March 2012</phrase>. Therefore, tenants with a secure tenancy will lose their security if their family grows and they need to move to a larger home, or if a person wishes to downsize to a smaller home and the only properties available for re-let are offered on a flexible tenancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.4/6">The Homes and Communities Agency is clear that the expectation is for both flexible tenancies and affordable rents in re-lets and new developments. In future, those families will have an absolutely impossible choice. Do they stay in a home that is no longer suitable for their needs, leaving them overcrowded but with the security they crave and a rent they can afford, or do they accept the move to a larger home, lose their security, and risk losing their home altogether if they are deemed no longer to meet the eligibility criteria for social housing, which could happen two years down the line?</p>

	<p pid="b.419.1/1">Yet again, this is all about discretion and saying, &#8220;Trust us.&#8221; I am afraid that we would like to see something clearer in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.1/2">Live-in siblings is another area where there should also be statutory succession. Once again, we can all look at our constituency experience. During the passage of the Civil Partnership Act 2004, the Conservative Front-Bench spokesman said:</p>
	<p pid="b.419.1/3">&#8220;It is profoundly unfair that carers and siblings who cohabit are disadvantaged on the death of one or other of them by being forced out of their home by their tenancy terms&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2004-10-12.188"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 October 2004; Vol. 425, c. 188</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.419.1/4">That legislation was the wrong place for that debate. This Bill is the right place, and our amendments would address the issue. Something else that ought to be addressed, and which we sought to address in Committee, is the right of unmarried couples. I am pleased that the Government seem to have shelved the idea of giving &#163;2 a week&#8212;or whatever it was&#8212;to get married. However, the Bill gives newlyweds more succession rights to a tenancy than a cohabiting unmarried couple who have shared a home for decades, even when those newlyweds have cohabited for only a matter of days. That is not fair or appropriate. If passed unamended, clause 134 would not reflect modern family life for many families in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.1/5">The Minister said in Committee that there was some tidying up to be done. I acknowledge that Government amendments 194 to 201 try to improve the provisions and address the succession issues. In so far as they represent a degree of Government movement since Committee, I welcome those amendments. I also welcome the Minister&#8217;s acknowledgment at the time that the Bill was far from perfect. A host of Government amendments have been tabled&#8212;more than the norm on Report&#8212;which largely reflects the lack of pre-legislative scrutiny that the Bill received and the rushed consultations.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.1/6">I shall try to get through our remaining amendments as quickly as possible. On the right of tenants to complain directly to the housing ombudsman, we oppose clause 153 and seek to remove it with amendment 278. Clause 153 would require tenants to seek permission and approval from their elected representatives to complain about their social landlord to the housing ombudsman. We support the National Housing Federation position on this issue. Amendment 278 would allow tenants the</p>
	<p pid="b.419.1/7">right to complain directly, as they can now. The National Housing Federation represents landlords, who possibly have the most to lose from the change, yet they are very relaxed about allowing tenants that direct link.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.1/8">New clauses 24 and 25 seek to clamp down on loopholes in housing law that can be exploited by fraudsters and to deal with the issue of fairness&#8212;on which the Minister, he say yes! I am grateful to him for acknowledging that we brought to his attention something on which he thinks he can build. I look forward to seeing further amendments in the other place. When it comes to fairness in the allocation of homes and the transparency of the process, we felt that the local authorities in the cases that we highlighted needed a right of redress. Neither case is sub judice. They were highlighted for us by Arden Chambers, and they are Birmingham <i>v</i>. Qasim and Newport <i>v</i>. Charles. We would be grateful if both cases could be looked at in detail and amendments brought forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.1/9">There are a host of issues concerning homelessness that, given enough time, deserve to be debated properly on the Floor of the House. However, given the constraints on Report, it is neither appropriate nor possible to give them another airing or vote on them all, as we did in Committee. I am sure that a number of those issues will be raised again in another place, given the depth of expertise there. In Committee, we sought a requirement for better standards in the private rented sector&#8212;a point touched on by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40569" name="Stephen Gilbert">the hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert)</phrase>&#8212;through proposals for an accreditation scheme. I would support any move in the other place to resurrect that and look at it in more detail.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.420.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" speakername="Alison Seabeck" colnum="420"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0003.htm#11051871002242">
	<p pid="b.420.1/1">The hon. Gentleman knows that I agree. I tabled the amendments in Committee proposing exactly that, so the answer is yes. We tabled those amendments because we wanted to see an end to homeless applicants being placed in sub-standard or unsafe accommodation. Sadly, the Government rejected those amendments, and we shall have to wait to see how the matter pans out in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/2">In Committee, we also sought to improve the advice offered to people presenting as homeless, but that, too, was rejected, as was our amendment to ensure that the Government&#8217;s changes to housing benefit would not leave families intentionally homeless. The Government also rejected our amendment to ensure that any private sector accommodation into which homeless applicants were placed should be deemed to be affordable, although the Minister has mentioned taking affordability into account. An amendment seeking to prevent homelessness through better advice, with statutory guarantees on the quality of that advice, was also rejected. The hon. Members for Bradford East (Mr Ward) and for St Austell and Newquay expressed similar concerns, but sadly, they withdrew all their amendments and held the coalition</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/3">line. I hope that we will be able to convince some Members on the Government Benches to join us in the Lobby today because of the Government&#8217;s failure to listen to the arguments that we and they made in Committee. I am sure that their colleagues in the Lords will also look closely at these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/4">More than 160,000 people presented as homeless last year, and I am disappointed that a Bill that will have a profoundly negative impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of people has returned to the Floor of the House after its Committee stage, and after a lengthy pause, with no amendments to address the criticisms and concerns levelled by charities and experts who deal with homelessness on a day-to-day basis. Two very good reports have been published in the past fortnight. One from Crisis, on single homelessness, flags up the areas in which the most can and should be done to prevent homelessness. The other, from the Homeless People&#8217;s Commission, points out that offering better advice will save the Exchequer money.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/5">The Bill is a retrograde step. Homeless applicants found to be in priority need and unintentionally homeless will no longer be able to draw on the security and stability of a social home with security of tenure. Instead, they will be placed directly into the private rented sector and if they refuse an offer, for whatever reason, the local authority will no longer have a duty to house them. They would then have almost nowhere to turn for help. It does not take much to realise the circumstances in which an offer might be unacceptable to an applicant. The accommodation might be too expensive, too far away from their child&#8217;s school&#8212;a point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40295" name="Andy Slaughter">the Member for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter)</phrase>&#8212;or too close to an abusive ex-partner. It might also be damp, mouldy or unsafe&#8212;the list goes on. Key among all this is the insecurity that a private rented sector offer can sometimes bring. There was a very good article in <i>Inside Housing</i> this week, following a survey that clearly showed that a homeless person placed in the private rented sector was likely to face eviction very early, and to be turned around and around in a circle of homelessness.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/6">The third biggest cause of statutory homelessness last year was the loss of an assured shorthold tenancy. As I said earlier, stability is vital in order to prevent what people have referred to as the revolving door of homelessness. With tenancies in the private rented sector being less stable and of a shorter duration, the risk of recurring homelessness is greater, so the need for stronger statutory protection increases. Amendments 273, 274, 275, 276 and 360, taken together, would extend the period within which the homelessness duty would recur from two years to five years when the applicant was placed in the private rented sector. They would also provide, during that five year period, that a household accepted as homeless should receive &#8220;reasonable preference&#8221; on their local authority&#8217;s housing allocation scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/7">Under amendment 269, the duty of local authorities to find temporary accommodation for a period that enables the homeless person to find accommodation themselves would be extended to intentionally and unintentionally homeless people who were not in priority need. It is important to note that this duty to accommodate for long enough to give reasonable opportunities to</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/8">secure other accommodation is distinct from the main homelessness duty. Extending this provision to those not in priority need would help an individual facing a crisis who might just need some short-term accommodation to get back on their feet. It would give the individual and the authority the opportunity to work towards resolving their homelessness, perhaps outside the social sector, helping to ensure that no one faced a situation with no option but to sleep rough.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/9">On that point, perhaps I can press the Minister to tell us whether the rumours on the street are correct&#8212;that his Department is considering announcing that no one should sleep rough for more than one night. Do these rumours have any foundation? If so, does he expect to table amendments in the other place to deal with the issue and what will be the additional funding alongside it?</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/10">I am sure that the Minister will have noted the story of Chris, a young homeless person in crisis in a recent Crisis publication, &#8220;The Hidden Homeless&#8221;. Told that he was not entitled to succeed the tenancy of a social home in which he had been living and caring for his grandmother for 15 years up to her death&#8212;this brings me back to my earlier point about succession&#8212;Chris found himself homeless and without decent advice or support from the local authority. As a consequence, he slept rough, broke into buildings for shelter, ended up with a criminal record and no break from the cycle of homelessness. Something must be done to address this; the Government&#8217;s Bill falls far short of the mark. I hope the Minister will reconsider his position on our amendments to deal with the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/11">Amendment 270 would ensure that, whenever possible, any homeless applicant to be placed in the private rented sector is offered somewhere within the borders of their own local authority first. The point has already been made. For a family with children, this will be essential to avoid having to pull the children out of school, and it is always preferable for reasons of community and stability not to make people move out of an area, except where there are valid reasons such as domestic violence, when a placement out of district might be preferable. There are going to be pressures, given the changes coming to housing benefit, so I hope that the Minister and his colleagues in the Department for Work and Pensions will bear that in mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/12">If the Government are insistent that they wish to place homeless applicants directly into the private rented sector, it is only right for them to acknowledge the need to strengthen protections for the very predictable outcome of their choices. Evidence shows that homeless people housed in the private rented sector are more likely to be evicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/13">Let me finish by saying that it is not just this Bill&#8217;s provisions that give cause for alarm, as changes to housing benefit will increase homelessness and rough sleeping. We have already seen homelessness increase by some 15% since this Government came into office. The Government&#8217;s consultation on statutory duties on local authorities has seen Tory councils like Hammersmith and Fulham viewing it as an opportunity to scale back their duties to homeless people, while Westminster council has been busy trying to ban soup kitchens.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/14">If we had several days to debate this Bill on the Floor of the House, we could easily fill that time, as many issues deserve to be debated&#8212;not least issues of supply, whether or not the new homes bonus will work, and why the planning Minister, the Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, the right hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells, yesterday brought forward an amendment at the behest of the Minister for Housing and Local Government, who is obviously getting desperate: houses are not being built and his new homes bonus needs a kick-start, so he is trying to buy planning permissions. We could have had an entire debate on that provision alone. As I say, many issues deserve to be debated and I have no doubt that my noble Friends in the other place will seek to pursue these areas when they eventually get their hands on the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/15">Our new clauses and amendments are designed to defend mixed communities, to extend protections and advice to homeless people, to stand up for security and stability for low-income families and to prevent the segregation of those sections of our society that this Bill will surely deliver. I urge colleagues of all parties to join us in the Lobby on amendments 13 and 271, which we intend to press to the vote.</p>

	<p pid="b.423.0/1">I wish to discuss amendments 13 and 271, and in doing so to draw on my experience of serving for 10 years as a local councillor in the city of Hull in east Yorkshire. I represented a large council estate, including the house in which my dad grew up, as well as the three-bedroom house in which my grandma lived until the day she died because it was her home.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/2">I have no problem with the concept of flexible tenancies, and I think that councils should be given tools enabling them to offer some form of flexibility. However, although I broadly support the Bill&#8212;an odd feature of this place is that Members tend to get to their feet when they are unhappy rather than happy about something, but I assure Ministers that there are plenty of provisions in the Bill about which I am perfectly happy&#8212;I should like to be given a few more details. The Bill states that local authorities may offer flexible tenancies, but I should like to see more commitment in regard to the proportion that they should offer, and also an absolute guarantee that they will continue to offer secure tenancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/3">The Bricknell estate, which I used to represent, illustrated the importance of mixed tenure. We had some problems. People lived in three-bedroom houses long after their children had left. The worst experience that I used to have at my surgeries was being asked by people after someone had died, &#8220;May we please have their house?&#8221; People were literally on death watch trying to obtain homes. I do not pretend that there is not a problem with people living in homes that are too big for them. However, they should not be forced out of their homes, to which they have a sentimental attachment. I do not want some official from the local authority to turn up all of a sudden and tell people whose children happen to have left home that under the terms of their flexible tenancies their time is up, and they must move on and make a home somewhere else.</p>

	<p pid="b.424.2/1">I agree. We experienced several problems of antisocial behaviour in the community that I used to represent, but we dealt with them over a period. After a while, people who had moved in from outside the area started to appreciate the community in which they were living and became part of it. Children befriended other children at the local school, and their parents then befriended one another. The sense of community was protected, which had a major impact on what had been huge antisocial behaviour problems. We had a sustainable community in which people had invested and in which they wanted to remain. There is a risk here. If people are constantly moving after short periods of time, they might not look after their houses and gardens. That may sound a bit silly, but the condition of houses and gardens gives an impression of what a community is like. If people feel they have a personal investment in their homes, they will maintain their gardens and do work to their properties; they will have some pride in the house in which they live because they see it as their home.</p>

	<p pid="b.426.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" name="Alison Seabeck">the Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck)</phrase>, the shadow Minister, for mentioning the new homes bonus, because people in Gateshead are considering what to do with the magnificent award of &#163;68,000 that we have been given by the Government under the new homes bonus. That is approximately 28p per head of population to spend on the development of new homes within the borough of Gateshead. However, I do not want to discuss that today, because I want to talk about my new clause 23. I declare an interest, because I had assistance in drafting my new clause from staff at the Local Government Association, and I am a vice-president of that organisation.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.0/2">New clause 23 proposes that the Bill should be amended to include a provision to support local authorities in reducing the level of littering from vehicles. The Bill provides an excellent opportunity to amend section 87 in part IV of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 to enable local authorities to deal specifically with littering from vehicles. Such an approach would help to reduce the high level of litter, not only at road junctions, roundabouts and exits from service areas, which are difficult to clean up, but in our streets generally. The new clause fits with the overall aims of the legislation, and with the specific new powers for local authorities to tackle persistent fly-posting and graffiti.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.0/3">Anyone who wanders around the streets of Britain will notice that litter thrown from vehicles is a problem affecting the cleanliness of highways and roadside verges, creating cleansing issues for many local authorities up and down the country. Furthermore, many drivers and passengers feel that they are anonymous when they throw litter from vehicles. The introduction of a specific offence where the owner of a vehicle is held responsible for such littering, unless they can prove otherwise, would discourage drivers and their passengers from throwing litter. Such an offence would also provide a further means for local authorities to tackle the growing problems of roadside litter.</p>
	<p pid="b.426.0/4">Littering from vehicles is a major issue for the public. In 2009, Keep Britain Tidy launched a campaign to encourage members of the public to report incidences of littering from vehicles. Although the campaign ended two years ago, more than 9,500 such reports were received from members of the public. We have all seen drivers who smoke depositing the contents of their ashtrays on the kerbside, usually not in their own street but in someone else&#8217;s or, as is common, around the country. We have all witnessed soft drinks containers, fast food wrappers, residue from fruit, half-eaten sandwiches and much worse being flung from moving vehicles or being deposited from a vehicle parked at the side of the road when a snack break is over.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.427.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" speakername="Ian Mearns" colnum="427"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0003.htm#11051871002254">
	<p pid="b.427.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point, with which I wholeheartedly concur. I was going to come on to that. It is mainly cyclists, pedestrians and local residents who have to negotiate their way through the mess that is left. This selfish, antisocial and irresponsible activity must be curtailed.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.1/2">In London, the power to tackle littering from vehicles was recently introduced by the London Local Authorities Act 2007. Section 24 gives a London borough council the power to serve a penalty charge notice on the registered keeper of a vehicle if any passenger throws litter from it. In that case, the use of a penalty charge notice rather than a fixed penalty notice means that that is a civil offence rather than a criminal one. Furthermore, due to defective drafting, the 2007 Act is not active until amending legislation has been given Royal Assent. I propose that the enforcement section of the Localism Bill should be amended to include a reference to vehicle related litter. That would follow on from the commitment to finding a solution to the problem made by Lord Henley, the Minister responsible for local environmental quality, at the national litter convention in December last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.1/3">New clause 23 has legislative precedent and is in line with the legislation on other road traffic investigation and fly-tipping offences and the approach taken to littering from vehicles in the 2007 Act. The Government have a chance today to do something about the problem and I hope that they will do so. I am convinced that the vast majority of the public that we serve would not regard new clause 23 as contentious in any respect whatsoever.</p>

	<p pid="b.427.2/1">I shall be very brief, as I wish my colleagues to have time to make their quite important contributions. We have some concerns about the issues raised this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/2">Let me start with new clause 26, tabled in my name and those of my hon. Friends. I was pleased with the Minister&#8217;s response. The clause aims to free small fully mutual housing co-operatives from burdensome regulation and significant costs that they cannot and really should not have to shoulder in the same way as private landlords. This would obviously help to provide a more conducive environment for new housing co-operatives and would not cost the Government much money. I know it fits in well with the coalition Government&#8217;s agenda for community self help and a mutual approach. That and other innovative schemes will, I hope, emerge from the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/3">I also want to endorse the amendments on ALMOs. I, too, urge the Minister to consider a ballot if there is a question of bringing things in-house, whatever the circumstances. Poole Housing Partnership, which is an excellent and outstanding ALMO, has provided a lot to our local communities over and beyond good housing stock. I want to put that on the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/4">Let me turn now to the key issues we have discussed this afternoon. Is there a place for flexible tenancies? We must ask that question. I think there is a place for flexible tenancies, but is there a case for two-year flexible</p>
	<p pid="b.427.2/5">tenancies? That question really needs to be addressed in the other place. I would hate to see the churn that might happen. I also think that the idea of a mix of tenancies, from a minimum of, say, five years through to secure tenancies, probably has quite a lot to offer. We should not need to be prescriptive from the centre. We ought to be enabling local authorities, but obviously some alarming information has been put before us today and that means that the regulatory side will have to be very secure.</p>

	<p pid="b.428.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman does not mind, I would like to be brief so that my colleagues can get in.</p>
	<p pid="b.428.1/2">I want to put on record my concern about the two-year tenancies. True, it is said that they will be exceptions but there is a big &#8220;but&#8221; once we start using the term &#8220;exceptions&#8221;. The Liberal Democrats want this issue to be revisited in the House of Lords. It is incredibly important to get it right.</p>
	<p pid="b.428.1/3">Let me briefly address the homelessness issue. Having a roof over one&#8217;s head by having something in the private sector might be a good option. However, the point has been made&#8212;and I have to go along with it&#8212;that we must look at all the individual circumstances such as whether there has been domestic violence and whether there are children in the family who have to be able to access their current school. If they have experienced trauma, it is important that they stay in their school.</p>
	<p pid="b.428.1/4">Like yesterday, time is incredibly short and we are left with very important issues to address, which will affect people&#8217;s lives, and we have no time to get to the bottom of them. That is why it is so important that as we pass this Bill to the other place, we do so with a lot of questions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.429.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" speakername="Clive Betts" colnum="429"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0003.htm#11051871002260">
	<p pid="b.429.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point. These measures are changing the status of council tenants, downgrading them almost to second-class citizens. That is what this effectively means and it is creating a form of welfare housing. There will be people who are so desperate for security that they will over-extend themselves in trying to become owner-occupiers, which could lead to real problems. I say to the Liberal Democrats that they should not hide behind the idea that the measures are all right because existing tenants will not be affected or because local authorities will have to choose whether to go for these forms of tenancies. The reality is that, currently, as long as people abide by the rules, they cannot be evicted from council or housing association properties&#8212;they cannot have their tenancy ended by their landlord&#8212;but under the Bill that will be possible, and if Liberal Democrats vote for the provisions, they will be allowing that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.429.0/2">Let me say one thing about the homelessness provisions. It might surprise some to hear that I am not, in principle, against local authorities being able to discharge their homelessness responsibilities by making an offer in the private rented sector, but I do want to see clear safeguards. If a house becomes available in my constituency, where some areas have very limited social housing, it is by no means apparent to me that someone who has just become homeless should get that property as opposed to someone who has been in the private rented sector waiting on a housing list for six years. However, if an offer is made, it has to be made with the standards of the private rented property being approved by the local authority, with the landlord or their agent being part of an accredited scheme&#8212;probably with regular inspections to make sure that the property is kept to a reasonable standard&#8212;and with a minimum tenancy length. I would certainly want those conditions to be included.</p>
	<p pid="b.429.0/3">Finally, let me address new clause 3, which is in my name. I heard the Minister&#8217;s comments but I still feel that a ballot is the best way of ensuring that the views of ALMO tenants are really taken into account and that we do not simply have consultations in which the tenants say one thing and the local authority does another, which is already happening. A ballot is the best way forward, but if the Minister is saying that the same process that was used to set up an ALMO should be used to dismantle it, he must firm up the guidance and make it a statutory obligation for local authorities to comply with that. I see him nodding, and that is very good.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.430.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40533" speakername="Gordon Henderson" colnum="430"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0003.htm#11051871002263">
	<p pid="b.430.0/1">Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" name="Ian Mearns">the hon. Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase>, I shall speak not about housing, but about litter, and I shall say a little about new clause 33. The new clause would extend street litter control notices to office buildings by amending the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Although this is only a minor amendment, it would have a major impact on the ability of local authorities to clean up their streets.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/2">Four years ago I launched a project in my constituency called Litter Angels to highlight the nuisance of litter. The idea of Litter Angels&#8212;which has now applied for charitable status, so I suppose I should declare an interest as one of the trustees&#8212;is to work with our local primary schools to educate children about the harm that litter does to our local environment. We take the view that catching them young might encourage more of them to practise good habits as they get older.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/3">More recently, Litter Angels launched a &#8220;Big Clean Up&#8221; campaign in Sittingbourne and Sheppey, which is encouraging local groups and individuals to commit to undertaking at least one project to clean up our local area. The &#8220;Big Clean Up&#8221; will take place during August, and I am proud that my constituency was one of the first in the country to embrace the national &#8220;Love Where You Live&#8221; campaign being run by Keep Britain Tidy.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/4">It was Keep Britain Tidy which highlighted to me a particular problem with smoking-related litter, with which new clause 33 deals. Sections 93 and 94 of the 1990 Act give local authorities the power to issue street litter control notices on premises that have a frontage on a street and outside of which litter or refuse is causing a defacement of the land. The problem is that the legislation was originally envisaged to tackle fast food litter and other such rubbish, and pre-dated the ban on smoking in public buildings and places of work. The House might be surprised to learn that the latest local environment quality survey of England revealed that smoking-related litter is present on 76% of the sites surveyed and is the most frequently found litter type.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/5">Much of that smoking-related litter can be found outside office buildings. Unfortunately, street litter notices cannot normally be served on office buildings unless they sell food and drink, whether or not for consumption</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/6">on the premises&#8212;for example, from a canteen or snack kiosk. Extending the street litter notice provisions to include office buildings would provide local authorities with the means to deal with localised litter problems and would close an unintended loophole in the legislation. The new clause would also allow local authorities to require occupiers or owners of offices and non-food retail outlets to play a greater role in dealing with the scourge of litter and encourage members of the public to take increased responsibility for their litter.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/7">It is worth pointing out that in June 2007 the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs undertook a final regulatory impact assessment on the extension of street litter control notices. This was as a response to the potential impact of the smoking ban on littering and its extension to office buildings. That assessment confirmed that if local authorities were able to issue street litter control notices in respect of offices and other venues not currently covered by the provisions, it would give them the power to place a greater responsibility on the occupiers or owners of those premises to clean up, particularly the smoking-related litter in the area immediately around them, perhaps by installing appropriate disposal facilities where this form of littering is a significant problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/8">The assessment noted that such a proposal was in line with changes introduced by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005, which followed the &#8220;polluter pays&#8221; principle by improving the powers available to local authorities to take action. A cost-benefit analysis undertaken by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in June 2007 calculated that such a proposal would result in a net benefit to society overall because notices would be issued only in a minority of cases and that costs imposed on local authorities and businesses would be relatively small and outweighed by the benefits associated with improved amenity, reduced cleaning costs resulting from preventive measures and a reduced fire risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/9">To allow notices to be issued in respect of any type of office premises, rather than the current limited number of offices, the new clause proposes to widen the definition set out in section 94(l)(a) in part IV of the 1990 Act by omitting reference to &#8220;commercial or retail premises&#8221; and inserting &#8220;premises other than dwellings&#8221;&#8212;I draw the House&#8217;s attention to a typing error in today&#8217;s amendment paper, which shows &#8220;premium&#8221; rather than &#8220;premises&#8221;. My proposal has a legal precedent in London, where street litter control notice powers are currently extended to office buildings by part III of the London Local Authorities Act 2000, which, in reference to the 1990 Act, explicitly omits the words &#8220;commercial or retail premises&#8221; and substitutes the words &#8220;premises other than dwellings&#8221; for notices issued in the capital. All I seek to do is extend that principle to other areas of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/10">Additionally, section 93(2) of the 1990 Act states that the local authority may serve a street litter control notice</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/11">&#8220;on the occupier or, if the premises are unoccupied, on the owner of the premises&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/12">As office buildings may have multiple occupancy, I propose an amendment specifying that notices may be issued on the owner of any premises where there is multiple occupancy. New clause 33 is uncontroversial</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/13">and designed simply to close a loophole in the current legislation. I hope that the Minister will agree to include it in this important Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.432.0/1">I draw attention to the interest I declared at the beginning of the Bill&#8217;s passage through the House and again in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.432.0/2">It is, in my view, a sad day for housing when we come to consider this Bill on Report, as it involves a series of retrograde steps that are damaging to the future housing prospects of millions of our fellow citizens, weaken tenant rights and safeguards for homeless people, and undermine the future of social housing in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.432.0/3">It is particularly sad that we have had most of the debate during the extraordinary absence of the Minister for Housing and Local Government, who is responsible for this and yet graced us with his attendance for only a few minutes in a previous sitting and has made no contribution whatsoever to the passage of the Bill through the House. That is an extraordinary comment on his values. His approach, which the Government have adopted since coming to power last year, has been to cut drastically the funding for social housing, including a massive 65% reduction to the Homes and Communities Agency budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.432.0/4">We are seeing individual rights cut back, such as tenant rights for homeless people. There is a curious element in this that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase> hinted at in his impressive contribution. He rightly highlighted the fact that the Government are giving greater priority to the interests of the providers of housing than to the public, the customer and the user of services. That is not compatible with normal Conservative rhetoric, and we have heard, again and again, their attack on provider interests and their wish to support the position of the customer and the user of services, but not here. Tenants&#8217; rights and the rights of homeless people are being cut back, and when we argue that point we get the answer, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, because the providers will do the right thing. They will look after the interests of tenants. They will give lots of security, they won&#8217;t undermine tenants&#8217; security and they will look after the interests of homeless people. Trust the providers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.432.0/5">That is an interesting stance for the Government to take in this policy area, because in almost every other we hear a completely different rhetoric&#8212;the rhetoric of increasing the power and the influence of the customer, of the user of the service. Indeed, this Bill contains a great many passages where exactly that has motivated the Government, so there is a curious disconnect between the Government&#8217;s rhetoric and what they are doing on housing. The only way I can explain it is by saying that they clearly have no interest at all in the future of social housing and in the interests of the people who live in social housing or depend on it for their future prospects.</p>

	<p pid="b.433.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point that I entirely endorse. It shows that the Minister&#8217;s claim was entirely incorrect, and he should be ashamed of making it.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/2">The first amendment in my name, amendment 361, is about security of tenure. It is not the wrecking amendment that the Minister tried to pretend it is. It simply states:</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/3">&#8220;In preparing its tenancy strategy a local authority must ensure that to the greatest extent possible, tenancies granted in its area provide security of tenure so as to support and develop stable and confident communities.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/4">That is absolutely in keeping with the intelligent comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> on how there is a place for flexible tenancies, but they should not take over, and to the greatest extent possible we should try to support security and help to build stable communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/5">That is the purpose of the amendment, and I cannot understand why the Government are reluctant to accept it. I give the Minister one last chance. If he wants to be held to have any real credibility on the issue, he should accept it, because it would indicate that he is not simply performing a sleight of hand that will deny tenants</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/6">security, but is genuinely interested in maximising the number of tenants who enjoy security of tenure. That would at least be a step in the right direction, and I hope that the Government will change their mind. I note, however, that he did not bother to respond to my question about why they have not accepted the amendment on a minimum of five years, so perhaps I might do a little better on this second try.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/7">Amendment 362 is designed to safeguard the Government against embarrassment. As the Minister will know, because we debated it in Committee, this is about the incompatibility of the phrasing of the Bill with article 8 of the European convention on human rights, as interpreted by the Supreme Court in two recent judgments. The Supreme Court indicated that where tenants make representations against a possession action, the courts must have the discretion to be able to consider whether it is proportionate to grant possession in the circumstances. That is clearly incompatible with the passage in the Bill that says that the courts must grant possession in all cases, without any doubt at all. I do not see how it is possible for the Secretary of State to have signed the statement saying that the wording of the Bill is compatible with article 8 when clearly it is not&#8212;or perhaps compatibility can apply only if it is put aside when cases come before the courts. It would be a rather odd position for a Minister to take if he was expecting the courts to ignore the wording of a Bill that he was putting before Parliament. In the interests of avoiding embarrassment for the Government, I hope that they will accept the amendment, which the Minister will know I have slightly amended to take account of one of the objections that he put up in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/8">The Minister entirely misinterpreted my purpose in tabling amendment 363, which was not to weaken tenancy standards but to safeguard housing associations from the risk of reclassification as public sector bodies. This is a long and complex story, and I will not go into it, but it was debated at length when the legislation creating the Tenant Services Authority was going through Parliament. I took a similar line then, from the Government side of the House, which is that while we want to see frameworks in place that ensure proper safeguards for standards, we should be very careful about creating a chain that goes directly from a ministerial fiat to an instruction to a housing association which could lead to the view being formed that they are no longer independent bodies that can be classified as being in the private sector, or not in the public sector. If such a change were to take place and housing associations were to become classified as public sector bodies, they could no longer borrow from the private sector without that counting against public expenditure. That would, at a stroke, wholly undermine the programme of housing association investment, and it would cause considerable financial embarrassment to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/9">I hope that the Government will think carefully about this. The individual, particular reference to standards would not necessarily, of itself, constitute sufficient grounds for the classification to be changed, but cumulatively the impact of an ever-increasing number of instances where the Secretary of State was able to instruct the Tenant Services Authority, or whatever body, to then instruct a housing association on how to act could lead to the view being formed that these are</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/10">no longer bodies that are independent of the public sector. That is a very dangerous step. I tabled the amendment simply to advise the Government that this is a dangerous area that they need to think about carefully, because it could seriously undermine the whole funding of social housing in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.3/11">Now that I have explained my amendments, I hope that the Government will be more thoughtful and reasonable in responding to them than was evident in the line that the Minister adopted earlier. If there is no change, I sincerely hope that all Members of this House who care about the future of social housing will vote to safeguard the interests of the public, users of the service, tenants and homeless people rather than those of the providers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.435.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="435"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0003.htm#11051896001904">
	<p pid="b.435.0/1">I remind the House that one of the new clauses and amendments in this group is my new clause 38. The Minister did not specifically refer to that in his introduction. I had helpful conversations with Ministers before tabling it, and I hope that the Government will be sympathetic towards it. I understand that it may not be possible to agree to it today, but obviously there will be other opportunities if the principle is accepted.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.0/2">My proposal deals with the straightforward point that, often, an existing occupier of land who is acting perfectly properly and within planning permission, such as a bakery, a print works or another business, is challenged by people who move in nearby&#8212;often it is residential occupiers, who in my constituency will have paid quite a large price for their property&#8212;who complain about the activity that was known to happen there when they moved in. People who had moved into Bermondsey street alongside the Ticino bakery, which has been there for decades, if not centuries, complained that there was a noise at 4 o&#8217;clock in the morning because people were baking bread. That complaint is completely unacceptable. People who had moved in opposite the print works on Surrey docks complained that vans came in and out in the middle of the night to deliver newspapers. That is not altogether surprising and is absolutely obvious. That complaint is therefore unacceptable. I could go on. People who move in next to farms complain about the cockerels crowing, people who move in next to churches complain about the bells ringing, and people who move in next to mosques complain about the imam calling people to prayer. Those complaints are all nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.0/3">I want it to be clear that caveat emptor or caveat mover-in is the principle that we should apply. The important point is that such unacceptable complaints threaten businesses. They threaten the livelihood of the farmer, the baker, the print works or the night club. My constituency is regularly afflicted by people who think that they have a right to complain, even though they are the Johnny or Joanna-come-lately. I hope that that issue can be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.0/4">I will move on to the wider subjects in this group of amendments. I am very supportive of the comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase>, who expressed her concern not that the Government are not listening, but that they may need to go further in the House of Lords to accommodate the points made by those of us who for years have had a passionate concern for social housing and council housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.0/5">I commend the speech of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase>. I, like him, have an absolute commitment to council property, and think that we should have more, not less, of it. I think that local authorities should be encouraged to build it, not discouraged from doing so. He speaks from his personal and constituency experience. I think that I am still the Member of Parliament who represents more council tenants than any other Member in England, so this issue is hugely important in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.0/6">Of course we need to deal with under-occupying and with the fact that people may become council tenants when they are poor and then become very rich. It seems to me that the way to deal with that is not to evict them, but to ask them to pay more money for the property, so that rather than changing their status, the cost of the property reflects their ability to pay. Otherwise, communities are broken up. Social housing should provide people with a spare bedroom to deal with the flexibility of the household. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" name="Alison Seabeck">The hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole referred to that issue. As they grow older, a couple may need two bedrooms rather than one. Somebody might need a carer or their family or friends to come and stay. I therefore hope that we will always assume that there should be a spare bedroom.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.0/7">Lastly, I hope that while accepting the principle of flexibility, the Government will have a presumption that the stability and security of communities is what we are striving for. Every year, about a quarter of the electors in my constituency move on or off the electoral roll. They do not necessarily move in or out of the constituency, but sometimes within it. I appreciate that the position in inner London is more extreme than elsewhere. However, we must build communities, and that is done by having more, not less, security. That does not mean that there should be no flexibility or that councils and other providers should have no ability to have tenancies that are not secure, but security of tenure should be the presumption. I hope that as the Bill goes from this place to the other place, the concerns from across the House will continue to be considered. This is not just an urban issue, but a rural one.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.0/8">I look forward to Ministers being positive about the noises that they have heard from Government Members, as well as from Opposition Members, this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="b.438.1/1">In two minutes, I shall try to make three points. I apologise for not being in the Chamber throughout the debate. I was here at the beginning, but then I attended a debate in Westminster Hall and chaired a meeting elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.1/2">My first point is a warning, and it comes from the excellent speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase>. He asked whether tenants will be evicted when councils come round to inspect a</p>
	<p pid="b.438.1/3">property. The answer is that they will be&#8212;that is what will happen. Just as universities increased fees to &#163;9,000, the bulk of councils will seize upon the two-year tenure rule. As a result, we will see the invidious inspection of properties to see how much people are earning, and there will be evictions. I give this warning to hon. Members: if this measure is enacted, MPs will be the first people those tenants will come to. On Monday, I tied to prevent a constituent from being evicted from a private rented property. She was being evicted not because she had not paid the rent and or because of antisocial behaviour, but simply because the landlord wanted the property back so that he could re-let it on a higher rent. That will happen time and again, and those who are evicted will come to our surgeries. I warn Members to be careful what they vote for tonight. The measure will cause untold suffering that will land on our doorsteps.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.1/4">My second point is a statement. The reality is that tonight is the end of council housing as we know it. The argument has been made that there is a turnover of 5% a year in tenancies. If so, within a generation nobody will be given a secure tenancy. We need to be aware of what voting for this legislation would mean: let us admit that it is the end of council housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.1/5">Thirdly, as someone who is proud to have been brought up in a council house in a thriving community, I do not understand why council tenants should be discriminated against in this way. We are not a different type of people: we, too, want secure accommodation; sometimes when our children grow up and leave, we enjoy that extra bedroom; or when things go wrong and they want to come home, we want them to be able to do so; but above all people want security. This is discriminatory legislation, and to be frank it discriminates on class grounds. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase> said, it is as though council house tenants are second-class citizens, yet their rents cover the costs of their properties&#8212;in fact, they subsidise others because of the amount they pay in relation to the cost of the property itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.1/6">For those three reasons, people need to think very carefully before voting tonight. People will interpret this measure as an attack on a large number of people, some of whom are vulnerable, and it will undermine the basis of housing in our country for a long time to come.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.439.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40176" speakername="Martin Vickers" colnum="439"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0003.htm#11051896001912">
	<p pid="b.439.0/1">I will be brief, because many of my points have been made already. Indeed, I could have written the speech of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase> for him. If he needs a speech writer, I am readily available. My speech will contain some repetition, therefore.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/2">The Government&#8217;s aim not just in the Bill, but in all their policies, is to build and strengthen communities, but strong communities mean strong, stable and settled communities. I have a concern about the Bill, so I put this simple question to the Front-Bench team: how will the Bill and the tenancy provisions build stronger, more settled communities? I am afraid that I remain unconvinced. It has been said that people grow attached to their homes. They are not just bricks and mortar; they are homes, not houses. I suppose, in one sense, I speak from experience, because I was brought up in a council house. I can vaguely remember moving from Fuller street in Cleethorpes at the age of 5 to a new build council house in the centre of Grimsby. No doubt that</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/3">was under the enlightened Conservative Administration at the time and the targets determined by Harold Macmillan.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/4">I cannot get my head around the aim of the Bill. My hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole used a line I gave him during one of his interventions: more flexibility for the landlord means more inflexibility for the tenant. What happens when children who have left home want to come back has not been satisfactorily dealt with. I share the view of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> that a spare room for carers or returning children should always be available in a home. Ministers know of my concerns. I raised them with three Ministers in Committee and on Second Reading&#8212;I am sure that my Second Reading speech was bedtime reading for all Front-Bench Members&#8212;but to sum up: how will shorter tenancies help to achieve stable communities?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.440.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40307" speakername="Andrew Stunell" colnum="440"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0003.htm#11051896001913">
	<p pid="b.440.0/1">I certainly have longer than yesterday, but not quite long enough to answer all the points raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/2">I start by saying that we absolutely and emphatically refute the argument that we are ending security of tenure for social housing tenants. We are not doing that. This is not the end of council housing or social tenancies. On spare rooms, I would say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40176" name="Martin Vickers">the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)</phrase> that the under-occupation figures that I quoted were for properties with more than one spare bedroom.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/3">The amendments are wide ranging, but at their heart they are about not permitting a flexible tenancy arrangement at all and about under no circumstances transferring families for whom the council has accepted a homelessness duty to the private rented sector. To my hon. Friends and Opposition Members who have raised concerns that there might be unscrupulous public landlords as well as unscrupulous private landlords I would say that the point of having a housing regulator and tenure and mobility standards is to provide a solid framework for the decisions that providers make when they draw up their housing strategies and tenancy policies, which they will be required to do in consultation with tenants too. There is a legislative framework, and there will be tough rules and guidelines. There is also the guide on homelessness, which sets out the factors that must be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/4">Let me say to colleagues on both sides of the House that the Government are trying to help homeless families to get into satisfactory accommodation sooner, not handicap them. In relation to those who require social housing, our reform and the introduction of flexible tenancies will be one way of improving the fit and getting more of the 5 million people who need council housing into council housing. There are various myths, one of which is about the insecurity of the private rented sector. In fact, in the past three years only 8% of low-income households in the private rented sector moved because the tenancy was ended by the landlord. The other 92% moved because they wanted to move. We need to keep the facts of the case in proportion and try not to overdo the mythology.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/5">Let me deal with some of the other issues raised. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> for her kind words about our views on new clause 26. I have already responded to</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase> on the ALMOs legislation. To those who have raised their concerns about tenure security let me say that the guidelines on tenure standards will be available for inspection shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/7">Let me deal now with those Members who have made specific proposals. I can tell my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> that I am making &#8220;sympathetic noises&#8221;&#8212;I think that is the correct phrase&#8212;even if the neighbours are not in his case. On new clause 23 and 33, let me tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" name="Ian Mearns">the hon. Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase>&#8212;who was speaking, I thought, on behalf of the LGA&#8212;and to one of my hon. Friends who made the same point in relation to a separate amendment that we will certainly look carefully at the matters that have been raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/8">I am under strict instructions to stop promptly. I apologise to the House for not responding in the depth that I would have liked to the many points that have been raised. I have been listening, as have my colleagues, and we will obviously take forward the views that have been expressed and ensure that they are not overlooked when the Bill is considered in the other place in due course. I urge my hon. Friends to support the Government amendments this evening and to resist the Opposition amendments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.457.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40673" speakername="Barbara Keeley" colnum="457"  time="018:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0004.htm#11051896002969">
	<p pid="b.457.2/1">We have had more than 70 hours of debate and evidence during the Commons stage of the Bill, but I say to Ministers and Government business managers that to have only 90 minutes or so on Report to discuss groups containing 70 new clauses and amendments, as we did yesterday, was not satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">The hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> said that the Government had allowed a shameful amount of time for the debate, and for once we agree with him.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/3">I, too, thank all members of the Committee for their work on the Bill, and particularly Opposition members who, I think we agree, carry a heavier work load. I thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40287" name="Nick Raynsford">the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr Raynsford)</phrase>, and my hon. Friends the Members for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander), for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh), for Sunderland Central (Julie Elliott), for Gateshead (Ian Mearns), for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin) and for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds). I pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck) and for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey) for their excellent work and for leading the debates on our amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/4">I should mention the staff of our shadow ministerial team who worked long hours on speaking notes. Our work was supported immensely by the wise counsel of Sarah Davies and her team in the Public Bill Office. I join in the thanks to our two able Committee Chairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" name="Hugh Bayley">the Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">the hon. Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/5">Sadly, we still have concerns about and objections to a number of the Bill&#8217;s proposals. We object most strongly to the 142 extra powers that the Secretary of State wants to take to himself, the most toxic of those being the Henry VIII powers in part 5 which we discussed yesterday. Our amendment 37 proposed limits to those powers to amend, repeal, revoke or disapply any statutory provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/6">Ministers still do not understand the alarm and consternation they have caused by introducing these powers and the way they are conducting the review of the statutory duties of councils. I hope they will reflect on the debate and do more in the Bill&#8217;s later stages to limit those excessive powers. We disagree profoundly with the proposal to impose shadow mayors on 12 of our largest cities, a proposal that Ministers spent months denying they intended to introduce. It enjoys almost unanimous opposition from political leaders in the cities affected, such as Bradford and Leeds. The Institute of Local Government Studies at the university of Birmingham stated in a recent article:</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/7">&#8220;It takes quite a determined political masochist to design a policy that unites in opposition to it 100% of those most immediately affected, regardless of party. Yet Communities Secretary Eric Pickles would seem to have pulled it off with his Localism Bill&#8217;s elected mayoral package&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/8">I strongly urge Ministers to look again at their proposal to impose shadow mayors when the Bill goes to the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/9">On pay transparency, we welcome Ministers indicating that they will look at expanding their proposals to include low pay, but they have not gone far enough. Fairness and transparency must be applied to the private sector wherever staff are being paid from the public purse. Ministers can be assured, however, that our opposition on a number of other issues not tested in Divisions is as implacable now as it was in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/10">We reject the Government&#8217;s proposal to levy EU fines on local councils, which we think will prove unworkable and hope will be thrown out when the Bill is debated in the other place. Ministers have talked about reducing burdens on local councils, but they are creating new</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/11">duties and financial responsibilities at a time when councils are struggling with the challenge of dealing with the Government&#8217;s swingeing, front-loaded cuts. Most importantly, we still have serious concerns and objections to their proposals on planning and on homelessness and social housing tenure. As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington said, the Government have not moved far enough on the duty to co-operate. Worse than that, the additional changes to planning announced in the Budget and Government new clause 15 have created, as my hon. Friend suggested yesterday,</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/12">&#8220;confusion, chaos and nothing short of a car crash.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-05-17.276"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 May 2011; Vol. 528, c. 276</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/13">I hope that it is clear to Ministers after yesterday&#8217;s debate that there are grave concerns about Government new clause 15, which allows financial matters to be material consideration in planning applications. This effectively means that planning decisions could be for sale. As my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich said, the new clause poses a threat to the integrity of the planning system. The national planning policy framework should have been made available so that it could be part of our consideration. The Minister says that it will be launched for consultation later, but that is not good enough in the context of a Bill that makes such radical changes to the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/14">The Opposition want to give communities a say over the future of their high streets. I hope that our new clause that proposes bringing in a retail diversity scheme will find favour in the other place after Government Members rejected it yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/15">Ministers did not listen to our concerns or objections on their proposals on homelessness and tenure reform in social housing, and there was no consensus on these proposals. My hon. Friend the Member for Plymouth, Moor View made it clear that there is much in the Bill&#8217;s housing proposals with which we cannot agree, from the Government&#8217;s plans to weaken the homelessness duty to their plans to remove security of tenure, which would act as a brake on aspiration and a barrier to employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/16">On security of tenure, the Bill will cause instability and insecurity for tenants. We are concerned about the Government taking away the rights of existing tenants. Their proposals to put homeless people straight into the private rented sector could lead to a cycle of evictions and further homelessness. We hope that scrutiny of the Bill in the other place will achieve important changes, including an accreditation scheme for the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.457.2/17">In more than 70 hours of debate, we have worked hard to improve the Bill, but much more needs to be changed and revised. A Bill should not be rushed on to the statute book when it was not ready to start with, when it was not subject to adequate consultation and when Ministers have rejected many sensible amendments put forward during this and earlier debates. Therefore, we will vote against the Bill, because we want to send the message that much more change and improvement is needed.</p>

	<p pid="b.459.0/1">I wish to speak very briefly on behalf of my constituency of South Northamptonshire. I and my constituents thoroughly welcome the Bill,</p>
	<p pid="b.459.0/2">because at last it gives people the chance to allow communities to determine the fate of their own environment. For so long, Northamptonshire has been subject to a regional spatial strategy that has dumped housing all around its green spaces, and people have not been able to have a real say over what happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.0/3">We have the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation, which was given planning powers to see through those developments, yet we have not had the section 106 money, and we do not have the infrastructure, roads or even school places and GP surgeries to cope with the amount of centrally determined housing that has been foisted on Northamptonshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.0/4">On behalf of my constituents, I thoroughly welcome the Bill, but some questions remain, particularly in my area, about how we get from where we are today to where we want to be. Surely bodies such as the West Northamptonshire Development Corporation and the West Northants joint strategic planning committee, both of which the previous Government foisted on us, have to be removed in a post-Localism Bill world. I hope that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will listen to that very carefully.</p>
	<p pid="b.459.0/5">Finally, on wind farms, we are desperately keen to see local people able to influence the siting and number of them in their area.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.0/1">Before I move on to my remarks about the Bill, I should like to join colleagues from all parts of the House in paying tribute to David Cairns, the former Member for Inverclyde. I understand that Opposition Members want to finish in order to attend his funeral, and that is perfectly understandable, so I will be as brief as I can.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.0/2">Overall, this is a landmark Bill that should be welcomed on a cross-party basis. Taking Whitehall out of the town hall has been a key feature of the double devolution that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" name="David Miliband">the right hon. Member for South Shields (David Miliband)</phrase> has spoken and written about. It will help enable the big society, the vision of our country described best by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, and it is a huge step in the right direction of the community politics that Liberals and Liberal Democrats have articulated for many a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.0/3">The Bill frees councils, enables councillors and empowers local communities. For the first time, councils get the power of general competence: the ability to act in any area that they think is in the best interest of their local communities. They get extra financial freedoms, and the housing revenue account, long hated by councils and councillors, is being reformed. We are seeing increased rights and responsibilities for councillors, and the end of the ridiculous notion that they can predetermine how they act by having an opinion on a local issue before going into a meeting to talk about it. We are seeing the right of communities to buy assets, which may be lost to those communities without this Bill, being passed. We are seeing local organisations have the right to challenge badly performing local authorities for contracts, and through the ability to hold referendums we are seeing additional democratic checks placed in our community.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.0/4">For 13 years we have seen that increasing centralisation&#8212;an increasing reliance on a top-down approach to our communities&#8212;does not work. We know</p>
	<p pid="b.460.0/5">that centralised systems cannot display initiative or difference, because they are too big to fail. By dispersing power throughout the country, we are going to have a plethora of different approaches to service delivery, reflecting the particular needs of local communities, and that will be healthy for the communities concerned and for the country as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.0/6">Briefly, I should like to turn to my concern, which we were not able to debate yesterday, about the asymmetry of the planning process. Colleagues will be aware that I tabled new clause 4, which would have introduced a limited community right of appeal. I am quite clear, however, that the other 18 Members who signed that new clause are keen to see work proceed to ensure that developers no longer have the whip hand on planning applications, and I know that the Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local Government, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase> made assurances on plans to address that concern in the national planning policy framework. It was, after all, a manifesto commitment of both coalition partners.</p>
	<p pid="b.460.0/7">I pay tribute to my fellow members of the Bill Committee. It seemed like a marathon session over many months, and indeed it was. I pay tribute to the Clerks of the House who supported us in our deliberations, and to the officials, who are already making an early exit from their Box. I note that we managed to keep them awake for the past two days. I hope that our noble colleagues at the other end of the building are equally able to keep them on their toes. I also pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40682" name="Hugh Bayley">the hon. Member for York Central (Hugh Bayley)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40565" name="David Amess">the Member for Southend West (Mr Amess)</phrase>, who so ably chaired our discussions, which were broadly non-partisan&#8212;although we saw a little bit of opportunistic opposition from Labour Front Benchers this evening.</p>

	<p pid="b.465.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. On Friday, a Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs written statement said that there would no ban on exotic animals in circuses, as had been expected. On Monday and Tuesday, I sought an urgent question on that, and made a point of order on Monday. It transpires that there is doubt as to the accuracy of Friday&#8217;s statement.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-05-18b.469.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" speakername="Mark Lancaster" colnum="469"  time="019:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110518/debtext/110518-0004.htm#11051896003496">
	<p pid="b.469.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point that perhaps the Minister will address when he winds up.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/2">The EN 22022 standard includes a threshold that has been agreed internationally for decades, and the ERA test report said that PLTs exceeded it. In fact, the acceptable level of interference was surpassed by 30 dB. I am told that that equates to 1,000 times the interference power that any other domestic product is permitted. Why are we waiting for a new standard when there is already one in place?</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/3">Another problem is that Ofcom is basing its stance on the current situation, not future projections. However, the interference caused by PLTs is set to get worse, for various reasons. First, more and more people will sign up for television and internet packages that use PLTs, which are set to figure highly in the YouView package due to be launched next year. One report, which I will discuss shortly, estimates that the number of PLT users per square kilometre will increase from 159 in 2010 to a massive 703 in 2020. Secondly, as different PLT manufacturers compete to provide better services the interference will get worse, because they will be using a greater part of the spectrum. They are already veering into the very high frequency range, which has reportedly increased interference. Thirdly, PLT devices are being discussed as a way of communicating information about energy usage as part of smart grid technology, or as a way of providing data-linking between appliances around a house.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/4">Ofcom&#8217;s stance on PLT devices is also at variance with the conclusions of a report that it commissioned PA Consulting Group to undertake in June 2010. Ofcom claims that the current situation is acceptable because there are fewer complaints, in spite of a higher uptake of PLT units. Conversely, however, the PA report said:</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/5">&#8220;there will be a high probability of interference to some existing spectrum users&#8230;if PLT device features do not change from those currently implemented&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/6">PA recommends that in future, inference will be staved off only if devices are manufactured with mitigating features such as power control. I would be grateful if the Minister could say whether that has been put in place. PA also says:</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/7">&#8220;notches in the VHF aeronautical radio navigation bands should be mandated&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/8">Does the Minister know whether that has taken place? If mitigation is so essential, what does Ofcom propose to do about devices that are already in use&#8212;the ones that are circulated second hand or manufactured abroad, none of which will have mitigating technology? The PA report warns:</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/9">&#8220;it should not be assumed that the existing installed base is traceable or could be updated to incorporate these features&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/10">Moreover, what investigations have taken place into the efficacy of notching, considering that it is disputed whether this technique actually works? The Radio Society of Great Britain says that these technologies are &#8220;unproven&#8221; and that</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/11">&#8220;in the home their effectiveness in reducing interference to radio services will be much reduced&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/12">I would like to know whether the Minister has liaised with his colleagues heading up the excellent Digital Britain initiative. The current fibre-to-the-cabinet broadband upgrades that are being rolled out&#8212;some in my constituency, which is very welcome&#8212;share part of the same spectrum as PLTs. A report by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute showed that PLTs can interfere with this new technology. BT may well be rolling out products that do not work alongside each other.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/13">The problem is not without precedent. Every time a new technology is introduced, it impacts on existing technology, not least in the world of radio communications. In the early 1890s, spark transmitter radios were all the rage, until the cacophony became overpowering and legislation had to be introduced. Fifty years later, when cars and televisions were new and exciting inventions,</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/14">people&#8217;s television pictures could be distorted by the spark plugs of a passing car. Soon after, suppressors were introduced for all cars.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/15">In 2011 we are replete with electronic devices. We want to do everything faster, and simultaneously. We want to watch our high-definition televisions while surfing the net and using our smart phones. The radio waves are crowded, competing with one another. We have an electromagnetic compatibility directive that has hitherto kept interference in check. The Department says that the directive does not specify acceptable interference levels, but the standards that it lists do, and experts in the field have been using them for many decades. The aforementioned ERA report shows that PLTs inherently breach that threshold.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/16">Ofcom seems to place great importance on the fact that the complaints have been received from users of shortwave broadcasts and hobby radio users, but the security services can pick up the shortwave broadcasts of terrorists, pilots use shortwave broadcasts to help them to land their aircraft, and ships have sent distress signals half way across the world using these frequencies. We need to clear the way for such essential radio messages to be made or traced, and not allow their paths to be blocked by radio pollution.</p>
	<p pid="b.469.1/17">Will the Minister acknowledge that this is an issue of great concern? Will he promise to base his stance on PLTs not merely on the number of current complaints, but on the results of scientific experiments, on the conclusions of expert reports based on well-established interference limits, on the strength of feeling from experts in the field, and on the projections for the future number and usage of these devices? Will he also instigate some form of market surveillance? Instead of reacting only to individual complaints, will he initiate a holistic assessment of the proliferation of PLTs? Will he reconsider the fact that there are thresholds in place for interference, and that PLTs currently do not meet those standards? Finally, will he liaise with other Departments to press for category 5 broadband cables to be installed in all new homes as standard? This whole issue strikes me as a result of short-termism, with homes having to be retrofitted with technology. There is no reason why we should not plan ahead and create a suitable data infrastructure, rather than continuing with unsuitable piggybacking on existing technology.</p>

	<p pid="b.471.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40403" name="Mark Lancaster">the Member for Milton Keynes North (Mark Lancaster)</phrase> not only on securing this important debate but on his highly informed speech. I will try to respond to the specific points that he has raised, but perhaps it might help the House if I first set out some background on power line technology products, the Government&#8217;s policy on this matter and the potential impact for the radio spectrum.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/2">The main applications of power line technology are in home networking&#8212;we are all familiar with local area networks&#8212;as well as smart metering, with which we are becoming increasingly familiar, and home automation. This is a global technology, responding to consumer demand, and we see it being used not only here in the UK but in the rest of Europe, in the United States and in Australia. The use of PLT enables the increased</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/3">delivery of digital services, including broadband access, smart metering, and television services from companies such as BT. One of the practical benefits of PLT is that it frees the user from a fixed location.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/4">It is acknowledged that as PLT moves to higher frequencies, above 30 MHz, there is increased potential for interference, although as my hon. Friend pointed out, this is the case not just with PLT but with a wide variety of new and emerging electronic systems. Experiments by the BBC indicate there is some potential for localised interference. In practice, however, the evidence from people using the devices suggests that this problem is negligible. There are 1.8 million devices in service in the UK, but the number of complaints has been confined to a couple of hundred over the past three years. I shall turn to those in a moment. It is worth bearing in mind that those complaints are centred on a specific group of users, principally hobby radio amateurs, including those using citizens&#8217; band radio. That is not to say that this group is not important, but it suggests that the nature of the problem is confined. The experience in the UK is reflected elsewhere. For example, following complaints in Germany, the authorities investigated the situation, but declined to ban any products. In Austria, following a product challenge brought by the official regulator, the courts rejected the claim of non-conformity.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/5">In common with most electronic products sold in the UK, power line technology equipment is required to comply with the Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2006, which are based on the European electromagnetic compatibility directive of 2004. The essential requirements, which I know the House will want to understand, are that PLT equipment, to quote that regulation,</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/6">&#8220;shall be designed and manufactured, having regard to the state of the art and good engineering practice, so as to ensure that the electromagnetic disturbance generated does not exceed the level above which radio and telecommunications equipment or other equipment cannot operate as intended.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/7">The current regulations, as we have heard, do not set specific levels of interference; rather, they set objectives to ensure that properly designed radio systems will operate when other electrical equipment, such as PLT apparatus, is in use. The regulations are trying to remain flexible as this technology develops and adapts. Equally, not imposing a mandatory fixed standard allows the regulatory environment to adapt as experience of the use of this new technology emerges.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/8">My hon. Friend referred to EN55022, and I am sure most Members are no more familiar with it than many Ministers have been over the years. Let me explain that, following discussions between the European Commission, member states and the industry, it was agreed that this standard could not apply to PLT equipment for a variety of technical and administrative reasons. The Commission has therefore asked the European standards organisations to adopt an appropriate standard. Until such time as a standard is available&#8212;it is logical that it will affect both the UK and the wider markets in which British manufacturers work&#8212;manufacturers will need to design products that meet the objective, taking into account key issues such as the extent of knowledge, the requirements of other users of the spectrum&#8212;an important principle&#8212;good engineering practice and the state of the art. This does mean that, for a period, there will be a lack of absolute certainty as to what is acceptable. Let me be clear, however, that should products be placed on</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/9">the market that do not meet the objectives of the regulations&#8212;in other words, they cause unreasonable interference&#8212;those manufacturers should expect enforcement action to be taken.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/10">Let me explain how enforcement works before coming on to the specific issues about GCHQ and others. In the United Kingdom, enforcement of protection of the radio spectrum for radio amateurs is now the responsibility of Ofcom, while the BBC is the relevant enforcement authority for interference to commercial broadcasts. Ofcom takes a proactive approach to its enforcement role, but it can take action, like any regulator, only where non-compliance can be shown.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/11">As my hon. Friend has already stated, in June last year Ofcom commissioned an independent study, &#8220;The Likelihood and Extent of Radio Frequency Interference from In-Home PLT Devices&#8221;, better to understand the technical aspects behind its impacts. The study broadly concluded that, provided that PLT equipment entering the market continues to advance technologically&#8212;this is the key point&#8212;there will be a &#8220;negligible&#8221; probability of interference to the majority of spectrum users in the coming 10 years. We all need to bear in mind that these advances in technology are often driven by consumer demand, as my hon. Friend rightly pointed out, and by the desire to produce more energy-efficient and therefore cheaper devices.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/12">Mitigation techniques include fixed notching&#8212;limiting transmission to a part of the radio spectrum; smart notching&#8212;an automated scanning of the spectrum for free space; and power saving. In response to concerns raised by amateur radio users, including CB, their bands are subject to fixed notching. As the use of PLTs and higher frequencies becomes more common, this situation might be revised and additional mitigation techniques such as smart-notching could well become more prevalent and be applied more widely. This is likely to coincide with the development of a European standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/13">Let me deal now with complaints. Between July 2008 and March this year, Ofcom received 228 complaints that were attributed to PLT devices. To be fair, this needs to be seen in the context of about 1.8 million pieces of PLT equipment supplied here. All the complaints about PLT have been referred to the supplier for resolution and all except one have been resolved. Furthermore, I am advised that all the complaints were received from hobby radio amateurs. Ofcom rightly points out that amateur radio licensees do not have an absolute legal right to an absolutely &#8220;clean spectrum&#8221;. It is also worth noting that the number of complaints received over the last 12 months has been significantly less than during the previous 12 months&#8212;from 147 down to 53&#8212;even though, as my hon. Friend said, there has been an increasing rate of supply of this equipment.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/14">My hon. Friend mentioned his constituent in the Bedford area. Reference to problems caused by television aerial boosters serves to remind us that many products in common use do cause problems. In this instance Ofcom was able to take prompt action, which I think is a sign that it is not being merely reactive.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/15">Let me now deal with more serious issues relating to GCHQ and the Civil Aviation Authority. The GCHQ statement was issued by a staff member without proper authority, and contained inaccuracies. It has therefore</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/16">subsequently been withdrawn. I am advised that the statement does not reflect the position of GCHQ, which has informed my Department that PLT is not currently affecting its capability.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/17">The CAA has now specifically stated that it does not endorse or support the comments in the withdrawn GCHQ statement to which my hon. Friend referred. I accept that it is important to safety in aerospace, which he rightly mentioned, for all potential risks to be considered carefully, and the Government are clear about that. The CAA tells me that at present it has no evidence that a problem exists, but this is a new technology, and I can tell my hon. Friend that the CAA intends to undertake further testing as the higher-frequency products emerge on the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/18">When I looked into the issue in preparation for the debate, I was encouraged to learn that the Ministry of Defence, the police and the fire and rescue, ambulance, coastguard and lifeboat services have all reported no complaints about interference. That breadth of evidence seems to me to support the conclusion that the problem is limited to a particular group of people. It is not a case of complacency; it is, as I know my hon. Friend will understand, a case of trying to judge the proportion of the risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/19">My hon. Friend raised the important question of co-ordination in the context of the development of category 5. The Digital Britain team emanated largely from my Department, and we have close links with it as well as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Transport. Ofcom tells me that it regularly consults all the relevant public and private stakeholders, including GCHQ, the CAA and the Radio Society of Great Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/20">My hon. Friend asked whether category 5 broadband cables would be installed as standard practice in all new homes. I am advised that that initiative was part of the programme of the Digital Britain team. It must be said that although dedicated cabling may be the best engineering solution, it is not generally practicable to install it in existing homes without significant cost or disruption. For new build and rewiring it may make sense, but the rising cost of copper may make it prohibitively expensive.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/21">As with all potential sources of interference in the radio spectrum, users, especially those with the potential to affect security and safety-critical systems, we take our responsibilities seriously. The current regulatory regime is more flexible than some users may wish it to be, but that is for a good reason. As I have said, it must be able to adapt to changes in technology and its use. The Government intend to monitor the situation carefully, principally via Ofcom. Ofcom will continue to address any complaints that arise, but so far it has concluded that the technology complies with the requirements of the legislation, and that the few instances of difficulty should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/22">While the Government will continue to pay attention to the concerns of complainants, we believe that a ban on PLT products would be wholly disproportionate. Let me put it simply: our approach is to be vigilant in monitoring the situation and proportionate in enforcement.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/23" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.471.0/24" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
