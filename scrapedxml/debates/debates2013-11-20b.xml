Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards)</phrase> yesterday evening on that very issue. It is clearly important that the distribution transmission companies take a view of all the costs involved, but there is concern that when we make these transmission projects more expensive&#8212;through, for example, underground cabling&#8212;the cost is ultimately borne by households who pay energy bills.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.4/1">The recent price increases announced by the big six are unwelcome, especially at this time, which is why we are legislating to force energy companies to put people on the lowest tariff that meets their preference. We are also helping to keep bills lower by increasing competition in the market and opening up the marketplace for new independent suppliers to challenge the dominance of the big six.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.5/1">Last week a friend of mine who works with elderly residents in Ogmore visited four elderly residents in one day. All four would not put on their heating because they were frightened of the effect on them of rising fuel prices. They sat in the cold. Yesterday, it snowed in Ogmore. Is not this the time to call for a freeze on prices so that elderly people are not afraid that they will freeze in their homes?</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.6/1">As I said, the increases in bills are unwelcome at this time and we all know from our communities the pressures that puts on vulnerable households, but I would say to the hon. Gentleman that, on the slogan of a price freeze for energy, the Leader of the Opposition knows full well that that is not deliverable. We know from Labour&#8217;s track record in government that it was intensely relaxed about gas prices doubling, electricity prices going up by more than 50% and increasing fuel tax 12 times. It was too relaxed and complacent.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.7/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that one of the biggest impacts on the cost of energy is the high cost of petrol and diesel, and that the fuel duty freeze will mean that petrol and fuel duty will be 13p cheaper in tax terms and will help the cost of living enormously in Wales and across the country?</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.8/1">My hon. Friend is exactly right. It is of particular benefit in rural Welsh areas, where average incomes are lower. By the end of this Parliament, average fuel prices will not be 13p per litre lower; they will be more than 20p per litre lower than under the previous Government&#8217;s plan.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-20b.1213.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40423" speakername="Jessica Morden" oral-qnum="13" colnum="1213"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0001.htm#131120-0001.htm_wqn2">
	<p pid="b.1213.0/1" qnum="901106">A report by the CAB last week showed that over the past three years energy bills have increased eight times more than earnings. Does the Secretary of State not share the concern that Wales has the highest energy bills of anywhere in the UK? If he does, why does he not tackle that far more urgently?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-20b.1213.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40487" speakername="Stephen Crabb" colnum="1213"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0001.htm#131120-0001.htm_spnew10">
	<p pid="b.1213.1/1">Wales has some of the highest energy prices, but regional variations are partly due to higher transmission costs&#8212;an important component of an energy bill. That brings us back to the earlier question about wanting more expensive transmission projects in Wales, not cheaper ones. We are very aware of the pressure on households in Wales because of the energy prices increase, and we are not complacent about that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1213.2/1">A particular concern in rural areas such as Ceredigion is the crippling price of domestic oil. What work will my hon. Friend do, including with the Department of Energy and Climate Change, to support oil syndicates and oil clubs and encourage bulk purchasing to reduce price?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-20b.1213.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40487" speakername="Stephen Crabb" colnum="1213"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0001.htm#131120-0001.htm_spnew12">
	<p pid="b.1213.3/1">The collective purchasing power of communities and groups of buyers of oil might have a role in bringing down prices for consumers in rural areas. We are seeing that with switching as well. My colleagues at the Department of Energy and Climate Change are encouraging community groups to come together to strike collective switching agreements with companies to help bring down prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.1213.4/1">With sky-high energy bills in Wales, which are higher than anywhere else, and a Tory-aligned think-tank saying that people are maxed out on personal debt&#8212;there are about 250,000 of them in Wales&#8212;does the Minister agree with the planning Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40283" name="Nicholas Boles">the hon.

	<p pid="b.1213.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman is a member of a party about which one of his colleagues said that it was &#8220;intensely relaxed&#8221; about people becoming filthy rich. It was intensely relaxed about many families on low incomes being pushed into greater household debt. We do not take that approach; we are trying to bring down household debt.</p>

	<p pid="b.1213.6/1">Does the Minister agree that the Labour party claims to be concerned about the cost of living in Wales, yet on the one cost it can control, the council tax, it has failed miserably to support Welsh constituents?</p>

	<p pid="b.1213.7/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right.

	<p pid="b.1221.6/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. Constituencies across the House will have people who hold Co-op bonds who are very worried about what will happen to their investment. Let me be clear that the first priority is to safeguard this bank&#8212;and to make sure that it is safeguarded without using taxpayers&#8217; money. That must be the priority. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor will be discussing with the regulators what is the appropriate form of inquiry to get to the bottom of what went wrong, but there are clearly a lot of questions that have to be answered. Why was Reverend Flowers judged suitable to be chairman of a bank, and why were alarm bells not rung earlier, particularly by those who knew? In the coming days, it will be important for anyone who has information to stand up and provide it to the authorities.</p>

In Tory Essex, they propose to close 11 centres and downgrade 37, whose opening hours will fall from 50 a week to as few as five. So there will be fewer centres, fewer staff and fewer hours.

For the first time ever, there are 15 hours a week of child care for every three and four-year-old in the country. That never happened under Labour. For the first time, under this Government, there are free child care hours for every disadvantaged two-year-old in the country. That never happened under Labour. Also, to come, there will be tax-free child care under this Government. That never happened under Labour. And the child tax credit has been upgraded by &#163;420 under this Government. That is what is happening, but let me be clear: there is one policy that we will not adopt, and that is Labour&#8217;s policy of funding more hours through its bank levy. I will tell you why: Labour has already spent the bank levy 10 times over. The youth jobs guarantee, VAT cuts, more capital spending&#8212;Mr Speaker, that is not a policy; it is a night out with Reverend Flowers.</p>

They told us growth would be choked off, but growth is growing in Britain. That is what is happening. The nightmare of the shadow Chancellor wants to talk about everything else.

	<p pid="b.1234.2/1">On 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-20">20 November 2013</phrase>, RV Ramon Margalef, a Spanish Government research vessel made an unlawful incursion into British Gibraltar territorial waters that lasted 22 hours in total. During that time, the vessel undertook significant survey activity. Vessels of the Royal Navy Gibraltar Squadron challenged the vessel with radio warnings and continued to shadow the vessel until it departed. The Ramon Margalef was joined in British Gibraltar territorial waters by three vessels of the Spanish Guardia Civil, which attempted to act as escorts to this vessel. The Guardia Civil vessels were also challenged and shadowed by the Royal Navy until they left Gibraltar waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.2/2">Yesterday evening, the Foreign Office summoned the Spanish ambassador to the UK in order to underline the British Government&#8217;s serious concerns regarding this provocative and unlawful incursion by a Spanish state research vessel. During the meeting, the ambassador was again reminded of our continued concerns regarding border delays, which continue on a near-daily basis, and our desire to move relations on to a more positive track through ad-hoc talks, as proposed by the Foreign Secretary in April 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.2/3">Yesterday&#8217;s incursion occurred despite repeated diplomatic protests to Spain in recent months, and comes only two weeks after a dangerous manoeuvre by Guardia Civil vessels put lives at risk and resulted in a minor collision. According to the United Nations convention on the law of the sea, the waters around Gibraltar are indisputably British territorial waters, under United Kingdom sovereignty, in which only the United Kingdom has the right to exercise jurisdiction. We remain confident of UK sovereignty over the whole of Gibraltar, including British Gibraltar territorial waters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1234.2/4">The British Government strongly condemn this provocative incursion and urge the Spanish Government to ensure that it is not repeated. We stand ready to do whatever is required to protect Gibraltar&#8217;s sovereignty, economy and security. We believe that it is in the interests of Spain, Gibraltar and Britain to avoid incidents such as this, which damage the prospects for establishing dialogue and co-operation. The UK wants to maintain our strong bilateral relationship with Spain, which stretches across a range of areas and delivers support for UK and Gibraltarian interests. However, the Spanish Government are wrong if they believe that they can advance Spain&#8217;s position on sovereignty by increasing pressure on Gibraltar, whether at the border, through unlawful incursions or by other actions, such as complaints and posturing in the EU.</p>

	<p pid="b.1235.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for articulating the concern of many people both inside and outside this House, across the United Kingdom and in Gibraltar. It may be helpful if I give the House the most up-to-date information and the facts. It was not a Spanish naval vessel that went into British territorial waters, but a Spanish-owned oceanographic vessel. It did not get to the entrance of Gibraltar harbour, but was about 250 metres from it. It needs to be reiterated that an escalation of this matter is in nobody&#8217;s interest. A political solution to the dispute is required. Of course nothing is taken off the table. We constantly review the naval presence in and around Gibraltar, and we are certainly doing so now. We are keen to return to the ad hoc talks, from which the current Spanish Government withdrew in 2011, involving both the British and Spanish Governments and also the Government of Gibraltar.</p>

	<p pid="b.1235.1/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" name="Bob Neill">the hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill)</phrase> on securing this urgent question. I rise now to underline the deep concern on the Labour Benches that further Spanish ships entered British Gibraltar territorial waters yesterday without authorisation and stayed for more than 20 hours. Spain is our ally in NATO and on the world stage and is often our ally in the European Council, so its actions on Gibraltar are even more reprehensible in that context. The Spanish Government should be in no doubt that both sides of the House share the anger about yesterday&#8217;s events.</p>
	<p pid="b.1235.1/2">Will the Minister tell the House when he or other Ministers became aware of the Spanish ship&#8217;s incursion into our waters yesterday, and whether any effort was made during the 20 or more hours the ship was in our waters to contact officials or Ministers in the Spanish Government to demand that the ship be ordered to withdraw?</p>
	<p pid="b.1235.1/3">I welcome the decision by Ministers yesterday to again summon the Spanish ambassador. Is the Minister or the Foreign Secretary planning further calls to their Spanish Government counterparts to underline the seriousness with which this latest action is viewed? Gibraltar cannot and should not be used by Spain&#8217;s Government to score cheap political points.</p>
	<p pid="b.1235.1/4">The Chief Minister of Gibraltar is quoted as saying that he has discussed the possibility of more senior assets of the Royal Navy being put at the disposal of the commander of British forces in Gibraltar. Will the Minister give us more information on those discussions and tell us whether he has had, or intends to have, further talks with the European Commission on the ongoing delays at the border?</p>
	<p pid="b.1235.1/5">Finally, the Minister made brief reference to the Spanish Government having pulled out of the trilateral forum in 2011. Does he see any sign of the Spanish accepting the need to return once again to the use of that sensible diplomatic channel for discussions?</p>

	<p pid="b.1236.0/1">The hon. Gentleman asked a series of questions. I first became aware of this incursion yesterday morning. The House will not be surprised to learn that there were contacts between the British Government and the Spanish Government to encourage the Spanish Government to ensure that the vessel was removed from British Gibraltar territorial waters. I can give the hon. Gentleman an assurance that, as far as I am aware&#8212;this was the situation when I came to the House to answer the urgent question&#8212;the vessel had not returned to British Gibraltar territorial waters as was its intention yesterday, so those contacts have had some impact. The discussions about whether the naval presence in and around Gibraltar is correct are ongoing and the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised that I will not go into the detail at this stage. We are also in constant contact with the Government of Gibraltar to ensure that the information being provided is available to the Governments of both the UK and Gibraltar.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.0/2">Let me also address the point that the hon. Gentleman made about the European Commission and its role in trying to settle this political dispute. He will be aware that the Commission visited the border on <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-25">25 September</phrase> and will not be surprised to hear that there were few delays during that visit. The Commission has committed to monitoring the situation and possibly to returning in six months&#8217; time. We continue to provide evidence to the Commission about what we believe is the unlawful Spanish activity. We also urge the Spanish to implement the recommendations made by the Commission to the Spanish Government about how they can improve ease of access across the border. Those recommendations are to optimise physical space on the Spanish side, including increasing the number of vehicle lanes; to carry out more targeted checks, particularly as they relate to the significant problem of tobacco smuggling, and to develop a mechanism to exchange information with the United Kingdom specifically to target tobacco smuggling.</p>

	<p pid="b.1236.1/1">I commend my hon. Friend for his measured and carefully considered answer to the question. He will be well aware that the purpose of provocation is to provoke&#8212;that is, to provoke a reaction that justifies the initial action of provocation. I hope therefore that his policy will be to ensure that the United Kingdom does not fall into that trap. May I go back to the question of NATO, however? Under article 5 of the north Atlantic treaty, all members of NATO are obliged to regard an attack on one as an attack on all. Under those circumstances, is not the NATO route perhaps one of the most effective diplomatic routes that could be followed in this case to bring some sense to the attitude of the Spanish Government?</p>

	<p pid="b.1236.2/1">My right hon. and learned Friend makes an important point. Of course, we have strong and positive relations with Spain in a range of areas. Approximately 1 million UK citizens live in Spain and approximately 14 million UK citizens visit Spain each and every year. He is absolutely right to focus on the</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.2/2">importance of not responding aggressively to this provocation and to re-emphasise and reiterate the necessity to de-escalate what is a political dispute. My right hon. and learned Friend&#8217;s point about NATO is absolutely right, although the UK Government do not consider this a military attack. At no time has the Spanish navy come into British Gibraltar territorial waters.</p>

	<p pid="b.1237.0/1">The Minister says that a political solution is needed, but surely he would accept that we have a political solution. Gibraltar is British, the people of Gibraltar wish to remain British and that is that. Will he make it absolutely clear to the Spanish Government that this constant harassment is unacceptable, that if the Spanish navy is involved in such incursions we will retaliate with our naval vessels and that the harassment at the border must stop? It is no good going on saying that we are friends. Friendship consists of friendship; it does not consist of immoderate and intolerable harassment by the Spanish Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.1237.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman can be assured that we express our concern and distaste in the strongest possible terms about both the incursions into British territorial waters and the border disputes we were talking about a moment ago. I assure the right hon. Gentleman that our position on the sovereignty of Gibraltar is clear and unchanged. We will protect the right of the people of Gibraltar to determine their political future. The UK will never enter into arrangements under which the people of Gibraltar will pass under the sovereignty of another state against their wishes. Furthermore, the UK will not enter into any process of sovereignty negotiations with which Gibraltar is not content.</p>

	<p pid="b.1237.2/1">When my hon.

	<p pid="b.1237.4/1">I agree with the Minister&#8217;s measured response, but I put it to him that the problem is that there is no agreement between Spain, Britain and Gibraltar that resolves these problems. May I advise him to look again at the agreement that I signed as Europe Minister with the Spanish Government, but which was subsequently reneged on at a higher level? It was supported by the Conservative former Foreign Secretary, Lord Howe, and by Lord Garel-Jones. It guaranteed Gibraltarians British citizenship and their rights, including the right to political self-determination, but acknowledged the historical Spanish interest. If we move down that road, we might resolve these problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.1237.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a very fair point, and that is why, while we are making sure that we deter, as far as possible, any further incursion</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.5/2">into those waters and are trying to put in place mechanisms to resolve the challenges and the significant unacceptable delays at the border, the focus is on returning to the talks&#8212;both the ad hoc talks that the Foreign Secretary proposed in April 2012 and, hopefully, the tripartite talks that were under way before the current Spanish Government came to power, in which there was detailed discussion of the operation of the border and other matters between the Spanish, British and Gibraltarian Governments. In the long term, that has to be the way forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.0/1">Given the Spanish Government&#8217;s sudden enthusiasm for rigorous border controls, will the UK Government consider setting up a special line at Heathrow airport for planes coming from Spain, and a line dedicated to Spanish passport holders, so that we can show the same rigour with regard to their entry to the United Kingdom as they are showing in allowing our citizens to enter Spain from Gibraltar?</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a passionate point, but he will no doubt be aware that the majority of people who are inconvenienced by the significant delays at the Spanish-Gibraltar border are Spanish citizens trying to get into Gibraltar; many of them work there. We have to try to make sure that the Spanish implement what the European Commission set out in its correspondence with Spain, which I outlined earlier, to ensure that any citizen of any country wishing to travel across the border between Spain and Gibraltar can do so in an expeditious manner.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.2/1">Given the escalation in the violations of British Gibraltar&#8217;s waters by Spanish vessels and the increase in illegal road checks, instead of calling in the Spanish ambassador for possibly the fourth, fifth or sixth time, is it not time for the Prime Minister to get involved directly, at Head of Government level, to pursue the NATO route alluded to by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40438" name="Menzies Campbell">the right hon. and learned Member for North East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase>?

	<p pid="b.1238.4/1">Spain is a NATO ally, so perhaps the Spanish will understand that we may express our disquiet by stopping our naval vessels going to places such as Rota to re-provision, and may instead re-provision them in Gibraltar, or perhaps by sending an infantry company to Gibraltar on roulement more often, to express our extreme worries about what is happening to our people in Gibraltar.</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.2/1">With massive corruption allegations swirling around the Spanish Government, I am sure there is nothing Se&#241;or Margallo would like more than for our Government to take up the suggestions of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40407" name="David Davies">the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40624" name="Kate Hoey">the Member for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey)</phrase> or <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40298" name="Robert Halfon">the hon. Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon)</phrase>. The Spanish Government would love to escalate the situation. They would love to wipe all those stories off the Spanish newspapers&#8217; front pages so that they could have a good old-fashioned Francoist row with Britain. May I urge the Minister, if he ever gets anywhere close to his sabre, just to leave it alone?</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for those remarks. He is right that we need to be calm, but we need also to be firm, to make sure that the Spanish understand that the behaviour, both at the border and in the territorial waters, is not acceptable. He is also right to highlight the domestic political problems that Spain and the Spanish Government have. In addition, there are clearly some issues that relate specifically to tobacco smuggling across that Spanish-Gibraltar border. The Spanish Government, the Gibraltarian Government and the United Kingdom need to work together to resolve those.</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.4/1">I am left wondering whether there has been a breach of article 5 of the NATO treaty. I served in the Army in Gibraltar in 1995 as aide-de-camp to the Governor. Three-hour waits at the border were commonplace then, caused by overweight Spanish security guards taking far too long to do their inspections. When my hon. Friend met the ambassador yesterday, did he give him a copy of the treaty of Utrecht signed by the Spanish in 1713, which makes it very clear that Gibraltar is not part of Spain?</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.5/1">My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. I do not think the ambassador was given a copy of the treaty of Utrecht; I am sure he is very much aware of its contents. But he was told in no uncertain terms about the unacceptability of the oceanographic</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.5/2">vessel entering British Gibraltar territorial waters and staying there for the length of time that it did. He was also made well aware of the strength of feeling that exists in both Gibraltar and the United Kingdom about the unacceptable delays at the border, which are potentially hindering the economy in Gibraltar, and hindering free access and movement for Gibraltarians and for Spanish people as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.1241.0/1">By my count, this is the fourth time that the Foreign Office has summoned the ambassador and his representatives for a stern ticking-off. On each occasion the Spanish have escalated the dispute by trying to ruin Gibraltar economically with these absurd border checks. Does there not come a point where even the Minister would accept that this strategy is not working and that we need real action from this Government?</p>

	<p pid="b.1241.1/1">The United Kingdom is standing shoulder to shoulder with the Government and the people of Gibraltar. The Spanish activity, both the incursion into territorial waters and the border delays, are unacceptable. The British Government have made this clear in the strongest possible terms. The Prime Minister wrote to the EU Commission President to ask the EU Commission to get involved, which it has now done. We continue to provide evidence to the EU Commission, we continue to press the EU Commission to make sure that its recommendations to the UK, Gibraltar and Spain are implemented in full, and we will continue to do everything we can through diplomatic and political means to resolve what is a political dispute to the satisfaction of Gibraltarians and everybody in the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.1241.2/1">Partido Popular in Spain and the Government are extremely unpopular, so these activities are just a diversion. The trouble is that the people of Gibraltar are the ones who suffer every time the border is closed. We need to stop these things constantly being escalated. In the end, it is the democratic right of the people of Gibraltar to remain British, which they emphasise all the time. We must do more as a Government to make sure the borders are open.</p>

	<p pid="b.1241.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely important point about the necessity to improve access across the border, which is why we will try to do everything we can to ensure that the EU Commission&#8217;s recommendations are implemented in full. We also fully expect Spain to act on the Commission&#8217;s recommendations. The Commission is still clearly concerned by the situation and is committed to remaining engaged and following up in the way that I outlined. Interestingly, it has reserved the right to reconsider its position and has explicitly offered the possibility of a further visit to the border. If the Commission is to do that, I suggest that it does so without giving the Spanish notice so that it can see how people are suffering.</p>

Although Gibraltar is not in the UK, it is a British overseas territory in special social union with us, but regardless even of that, international law must be respected. As Spain is a democracy, in the EU and in NATO, should it not start behaving accordingly, and certainly not fire shots at a young man on jet skis in Gibraltar harbour?

	<p pid="b.1242.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is right about the incident that happened a little while ago with the jet ski. He will be aware of the strong protestations that we made at the time. To clarify the position, our policy on Gibraltar is crystal clear. The people of Gibraltar have repeatedly and overwhelmingly expressed their wish to remain under British sovereignty and we will respect their wishes. This is entirely consistent with the purposes of the principles of multilateral organisations such as the United Nations, which determine the principle of self-determination.</p>

	<p pid="b.1242.1/1">Is my hon. Friend aware that a possible political solution is already going through the House? My Gibraltar (Maritime Protection) Bill seeks to enshrine and update the treaty of Utrecht to ensure that Gibraltar&#8217;s waters have a stipulation of three miles in UK law. I know I have the backing of Members on both sides of the House, and that the Bill will have its Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-28">28 February</phrase> next year.

	<p pid="b.1242.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. I am aware of the private Member&#8217;s Bill to which he refers. My understanding is that it is not required, because under international law the three-mile limit in British Gibraltar territorial waters is already in place. Indeed, my understanding is that it may be possible to extend that to 12 miles, but we have not chosen to do so. The three-mile limit is already enshrined in international legislative structures.</p>

There is genuine anger about both what has happened at the border and the incursion into British Gibraltar territorial waters. Obviously, as I said in my initial remarks, we constantly review whether the Royal Navy&#8217;s deployment in Gibraltar is adequate. She will be under no illusions about the fact that we are now reviewing that, but ultimately this has to be resolved through diplomatic and political mechanisms. It is in no one&#8217;s interest to escalate this conflict. We hope that implementation of the European Commission&#8217;s recommendations, as set out in its letter to the Spanish Government, and maintaining the firm stance that incursions into the waters are completely and utterly unacceptable will change behaviour.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-20b.1245.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40652" speakername="Matthew Hancock" speakeroffice="The Minister for Skills and Enterprise"  colnum="1245"  time="013:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0001.htm#131120-0001.htm_spmin43">
	<p pid="b.1245.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I wish to make a statement on start-up loans. Since the great recession of 2008, concern has been raised repeatedly across the House about access to finance, particularly for the smallest companies. The contraction in support for small and medium-sized business lending following the financial crisis led to a sharp drop in the growth of lending to, and support for, small businesses. All Members will recognise the constraints facing aspiring entrepreneurs across the country trying to access finance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/2">Those problems were a consequence of an overreliance on bank finance compared with our international competitors, a hollowing-out of business lending units in the big banks and too much concentration in our banking system, followed by the biggest banking bust ever faced in this country and the biggest bank failure in the world in 2008.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/3">A calamity of that scale cannot be addressed by a single policy, so since 2010 we have engaged on a comprehensive programme of bank reform: splitting retail and investment banking; requiring greater capital; introducing a tax on leverage; introducing much stronger requirements to check that the people running banks are fit and proper persons, so that we do not get the likes of Fred Goodwin and the Rev. Paul Flowers sitting atop our banks in future; and introducing criminal charges for those who behave negligently in charge of big banks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/4">Those changes are part of a wider drive to change the culture of banking so that our banks serve the economy, rather than the other way around, but alone they are not enough. To help companies access finance, we have introduced the British business bank, doubled the seed enterprise investment scheme, expanded the enterprise finance guarantee, and last year we introduced start-up loans of up to &#163;25,000 per founder&#8212;although, more typically it is around &#163;6,000&#8212;to help budding entrepreneurs access the seed capital to make their idea a reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/5">For too long Britain has been a home of great ideas that are then commercialised and developed elsewhere. We want British business men and women to take brilliant British ideas and turn them into blossoming British businesses. The first start-up loan was made in September 2012, and since then growth has exceeded expectations. Over a third of loans go to black and minority ethnic entrepreneurs and over a third go to people previously unemployed. In June this year the Prime Minister announced that start-up loans would no longer be restricted to young people, so the age cap has been removed altogether. We are now seeing strong growth in the number of people over 30 being helped to realise their full entrepreneurial potential through the programme&#8217;s mentoring and financial support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/6">In August we introduced specialised support to finance ex-military service personnel who want to start their own business within the start-up loans scheme. I am pleased to announce that today we have made the 100,000th start-up loan&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Today we have made the 10,000th start-up loan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/7">Mr Allen Martin, a Royal Navy engineer from Truro, is the 10,000th loan recipient for the programme. Allen joined the Royal Navy in 1991 as an engineer and</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/8">mechanic, working with helicopters, search and rescue, and commando forces. He served for 22 years, in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan. Having been medically discharged, Allen knew what he wanted to do&#8212;start his own business&#8212;so he applied for a start-up loan and founded Eclipse Property Cornwall, which will manage properties on behalf of landlords, renting them out and offering full or part-time management. Allen Martin has benefited from the extension of start-up loans to all ages and the specialised support of our ex-service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/9">Given the success of this targeted approach within the full age range, we are now going even further. I can tell the House that we are committing a total of &#163;151 million to the scheme this year and next, with the goal of backing 30,000 new businesses by 2015. From <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-01">1 January</phrase>, the Start-Up Loans Company will specifically target priority groups: entrepreneurs over the age of 50, young people not in education, employment or training, and new mothers who are ready to return to the workplace and are seeking the ability to manage their own time and commitments on their own terms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/10">Age UK estimates that one in five of those over 50 now work for themselves&#8212;a growing trend accounting for 70% of the businesses started in the past five years, compared with 28% of those started by young people. With the added support of mentors who understand modern media and marketing, new retail platforms and communication channels, start-up loans can help to bring even more of those in this age group to success. That is why we are tasking Start-Up Loans to find the specialist providers who will make the loans a perfect fit for the older entrepreneur.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/11">On NEETs, I know that Members throughout the House have seen just how valuable and popular these loans are in tackling youth unemployment. Working with the new enterprise allowance, start-up loans give specialist support to those who have been away from the workplace for a long time and need strong and committed mentors with an understanding of what it is to start from a very low base. The Prince&#8217;s Trust has already demonstrated just how effective that approach can be, and much more can be done to create a targeted offer that creates the right conditions for these businesses to survive and thrive within the safe environment of start-up loans.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/12">Finally, new mothers are also turning increasingly to self-employment. According to Mumpreneur UK, self-employment for women is rising at three times the rate for men. So far, 37% of start-up loans have gone to women. We want to do more to increase that figure, so we will introduce specialised support for mothers seeking to start businesses who are juggling child care and seeking flexible ways to turn a business idea into reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.1245.1/13">With record new business creation, 400,000 new businesses, record jobs and a record 4.9 million companies in the UK, Britain is once again becoming an entrepreneurial beacon of the world. Our future prosperity rests on the entrepreneurial aspirations of the British people. This Government will not rest in our drive to support those who want to work hard and get on, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1246.0/1">I thank the Minister for his statement. Given that I first saw it when I arrived at the House, I also thank him for not saying anything</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/2">surprising during it. I want to place on record the thanks of the whole House for the work that has been done by James Caan and the Start-Up Loans Company to support people to set up their own businesses. I also record our congratulations to Allen Martin, the 10,000th recipient of a start-up loan.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/3">I understand that Allen is one of the very first ex-servicemen to benefit from a start-up loan. It was immense good fortune&#8212;I am sure the Prime Minister, as a public relations professional, will have appreciated his luck&#8212;that the 10,000th recipient of a loan should happen to be a Royal Naval veteran who gave 22 years&#8217; service to our country, is over the age of 30 and lives far away from London. Sadly, he is not all that typical of the people who are benefiting from the scheme. However, atypical as he may be, he is a great role model to inspire future business leaders.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/4">Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, so the &#163;50 million that has been lent to 10,000 new entrepreneurs is an important symbol of the enterprise spirit that runs deep through the proud history of our great island people. The Minister was right to broaden his remarks to address the broader context of the scheme. As we examine the performance of start-up loans in the context of the broader picture for small businesses and the support available, we will see that James Caan is right to say there is still much work to be done.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/5">Does this scheme have a default target and, if so, how is it performing against it? A key lesson from the start-up loans programme is that access to finance schemes is only as good as the infrastructure that supports them and that the schemes rely on a wider system of business support, mentoring and signposting&#8212;the very fabric of support that is so lacking in many parts of the country in the absence of Business Link, the abolition of the regional development agencies and the impoverishment of local government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/6">That is borne out by the statistics that we are welcoming today. In every recession, there has been an increase in business start-ups. People faced with a flat job market and low demand for their skills will often seek to create their own job by setting up a firm. Desperation is not a bad motive for launching a firm&#8212;I have done it myself&#8212;but it is noticeable that far and away the most loans have been given where businesses support networks are strongest, namely London: 15% of the population lives in London, yet 36% of the start-up loans have been delivered there.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/7">Does the Minister recognise the links between an integrated business support network and successful start-ups? If so, does he regret the destruction of Business Link and the failure to replace it with anything meaningful to provide support, not just to start-ups, but to developing small firms around the country?</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/8">Just as with the regeneration money from the Growing Places fund that went much more to London and the south-east, just 5% of the loans under discussion are going to areas such as the north-east, which has seen huge job losses and which we would have thought would be ripe for skilled workers looking to set up their own firms. What is the Minister doing to create a one nation business support network for those areas receiving the least of the start-up loans money? Although we absolutely recognise and welcome the scheme&#8217;s success in attracting people from black and minority ethnic</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/9">backgrounds and the number of women who have benefited from it, it is important that that geographical aspect is recognised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/10">Is the Minister aware that James Caan has said that support and mentoring is a more important part of the success of this programme than the loan? Is the Minister therefore embarrassed that recent research has shown that people using the Government&#8217;s Mentorsme website are four times more likely to offer themselves as experts than as businesses needing mentoring? Does he think that a scheme with four times as many experts as recipients of that expertise sounds like a success?</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/11">Will the Minister promise that the success of this worthwhile scheme will not blind him to the fact that there is a crisis in business support in many areas of this country and that businesses that would have had a chance of success will fail because of a lack of signposting and mentoring?</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/12">The Minister spoke about commercialised British ideas going overseas, but this type of scheme, important though it is, is not likely to make a difference, because it seems to be targeting a very different part of the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/13">The Government&#8217;s failure to support small firms with access to finance cannot be camouflaged by this worthwhile scheme. Given that the Government have overseen a &#163;14 billion reduction in lending to small business, will the Minister, at the same time as he celebrates his &#163;50 million scheme, recognise that total lending from it is less than 1% of the shortfall in net lending that British business has experienced? <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.1248.1/1">You are very wise, once again, Mr Speaker, to notice that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.1/2">Will the Minister make a statement on the real access to finance crisis that he has done so little about? Will he recognise the need for radical change to the banks through the Labour party&#8217;s proposed network of local banks and support for challenger banks, which will lead to the desperately needed improvement in the position of small firms seeking access to finance?</p>

	<p pid="b.1248.2/1">Mr James Caan, who runs the start-up loans scheme on our behalf and to whom I pay tribute, is absolutely right to say how important mentoring is&#8212;and I think we have just seen why. What a pity that the Labour party cannot be enthusiastic about and supportive of a scheme that has done so much: 37% of start-up loans go to BME entrepreneurs and more than a third to the unemployed. We are aiming for 30,000 and the pace of delivery is accelerating.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.2/2">I will turn to the specific questions asked. I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about business growth in hubs, which is why the development of Tech City UK and of start-up hubs around the country&#8212;in Manchester, Cambridge, Edinburgh and almost every city&#8212;is welcome and I hope it will get cross-party support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.2/3">The hon. Gentleman said that we need to ensure that this scheme is part of a package, but I am not sure whether he was listening to the statement. The whole point is that the scheme is precisely part of a plan to start improving access and helping people right at the</p>
	<p pid="b.1248.2/4">start of their business careers, and to then expand the enterprise investment scheme, enhance the guarantees available, establish the business bank and, most importantly, turn around the banks. I think that a little more support from the Labour party for turning around the mess it created would be more appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249.3/1">The interest is typically 6% and the average duration is up to five years, but those matters are of course also dependent on the proposition that is made. So far, in the year and a bit that the scheme has been going, the amount paid back has been pretty strong.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249.5/1">That is precisely why we need programmes such as this one, which I hope that the hon. Gentleman supports.

Many measures are of course needed, and this very important one is helping thousands of people to start their own businesses and realise their dreams.</p>

	<p pid="b.1249.6/1">I congratulate Mr Martin and wish him well. I started two small businesses that now employ almost 300 people, having gone into a sub-branch of Lloyds bank and come out with a facility of &#163;60,000 in 1989. That would not happen now, so my concern is about whether information is getting through properly at the coal face. Will the Minister tell us whether that is happening, and will he continue to monitor that matter to ensure that the people he rightly says are in need of loans can receive them?</p>

	<p pid="b.1249.7/1">Absolutely. The development and acceleration of the scheme includes an acceleration in people being able to get hard cash.

	<p pid="b.1250.4/1">Yes. Those are extremely important points. The growth accelerator programme offers support for small and growing businesses and is itself expanding rapidly. The start-up loan programme is not only about access to finance for those starting businesses, but about mentoring. The number of businesses sponsored by each mentor is small, so that mentors have the opportunity to spend time and put effort into ensuring that such ideas get the best possible chance.</p>

	<p pid="b.1250.5/1">Many of the people who have so far benefited from the programme are truly inspirational. The Minister may be interested to know about a perfume called Pink Addiction&#8212;I have tried it&#8212;which was created by Nabila Ismail. She was so positive about the scheme that the only thing she asked for was specialist mentoring wherever possible, a point which has been mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="b.1250.6/1">I pay tribute to Pink Addiction. My hon. Friend has put a huge amount of effort into supporting start-ups and small businesses. I am sure that being mentored by him would be one of the best ways in which someone could grow their business.</p>

	<p pid="b.1251.4/1">I pay tribute to the Erewash Partnership. Such local business support groups, as well as LEPs, the chambers of commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Forum of Private Business, the CBI and the Institute of Directors, play a part in making sure that businesses get to know what is available and are given support. We work in partnership with many of those organisations, which have done a great deal to make such a success of the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.1251.5/1">I believe it is a moral imperative for the Government to offer a route from welfare dependency and poverty to self-employment and prosperity, and on that basis, I strongly welcome the scheme. Will the Minister undertake to look at the work done by third sector and voluntary groups, such as the Cambridgeshire Community Foundation and the Peterborough-based Cross Keys Homes, in helping tenants and those not usually involved in the business world to avail themselves of the scheme and access funding for micro-businesses and SMEs?</p>

	<p pid="b.1251.6/1">Yes, I will do that. The fact that more than a third of the loans have gone to people who are unemployed is one of the scheme&#8217;s great strengths. Along with the new enterprise allowance, the scheme is helping us to reduce unemployment for people who do not want to go into an ordinary 9 to 5 job, and instead want to grow their own business.</p>

	<p pid="b.1252.1/1">Yes, I will take a special interest in ensuring that the Isle of Wight has access to the scheme. Many of the partners through which it is delivered are regional, but there are many national partners and much of it can be done online. I am sure that broadband internet is readily available on the Isle of Wight. If it is not, it soon will be. I will take a special interest in how many loans are taken up on the Isle of Wight.</p>

	<p pid="b.1252.2/1">This is welcome news, especially as the start-up businesses have gone on to employ a further 10,000 people. To build on that, what more can be done to encourage an entrepreneurial spirit within the education system to equip the next generation of young entrepreneurs?</p>

	<p pid="b.1252.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for adding to the statistics at my disposal. He is a doughty campaigner for enterprise in the education system. One of the main purposes of bringing together the skills and enterprise briefs is to ensure that the education system reflects and prepares people for the world of employment and enterprise. That is very close to my heart and I look forward to working with him to make it happen more.</p>

	<p pid="b.1252.4/1">The start-up loans scheme has been a fantastic success story. One reason for that success is the presence of business mentors. Will the Minister reassure the House that as the scheme grows, as new groups get involved and as the age cap is lifted, the number of business mentors will keep up I order to ensure that all the businesses have access to the support that they need?</p>

	<p pid="b.1252.5/1">We are finding that lots of business men and women are interested in mentoring, partly because they feel that they got so much out of growing their business and want to give something back. Engaging more mentors is a vital part of the scheme, but that is not a constraint on expansion owing to the enthusiasm&#8212;to which I pay tribute&#8212;of business men and women who want to help others to get the sort of start that they had.</p>

	<p pid="b.1252.6/1">As someone who started and ran a small business, I know about the challenges that are faced by people who want to run their own business, particularly in accessing finance. I was pleased to join the start-up bus when it visited Rugby. Does the Minister agree that the start-up loans scheme shows that the Government are providing real help to small emerging businesses, unlike the Labour party, which took advice on business and industry from the man who managed the decline of the Co-op bank?</p>

	<p pid="b.1252.7/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. It is surprising to see the Labour Benches almost entirely empty when the House should be uniting in support of the excellent start-up loans scheme. I pay tribute to my hon.

	<p pid="b.1253.0/1">I recently met a number of young entrepreneurs who had started successful small businesses using start-up loans. They had been refused loans by mainstream banks. Will my hon.

	<p pid="b.1253.1/1">The scheme is growing and accelerating, and it has the capacity to do more. I hope that we can do more with it, not least because it is helping people who would otherwise not be able to start their own business. We started the scheme because of the difficulty that is faced in getting finance from banks at an early stage. The evidence that my hon. Friend sees in his constituency is what I see across the country. That is exactly what this successful scheme is for.</p>

	<p pid="b.1253.2/1">I have great pleasure in welcoming this excellent statement because it brings good news about the real economy.

	<p pid="b.1253.3/1">I encourage links between colleges and local enterprise partnerships, which can be strengthened a great deal by their governors and board members sitting on each other&#8217;s boards. There are schools around the country that bring in businesses and entrepreneurs, not only to talk to students, for example through the brilliant Speakers for Schools programme, but to help design the curriculum and motivate children to improve their performance in academic subjects. That is a great success when it is done well and I encourage more schools to do it.</p>

Have you had any indication from the Justice Secretary on whether he intends to come to the House and make a statement to clear up the confusion regarding the announcement by G4S yesterday that it has been overcharging for services it is contracted to provide to the Ministry of Justice? The confusion is twofold. First, there have been reports in the press that G4S has offered to pay in the region of &#163;23 million to the MOJ, but that that has been refused. I think hon. Members would want to know the reason for that. Secondly, on the proposed changes to the probation service, last week on Second Reading the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40339" name="Jeremy Wright">the hon.

	<p pid="b.1257.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to regulate refractive eye surgery, including laser eye surgery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/3">Nine years ago, the late Frank Cook, a former hon. Member, brought together a group of senior MPs to take evidence and examine widespread concerns about the operation of the growing laser eye surgery industry. Those concerns included high-pressure sales tactics, variable standards of service and a failure to provide adequate aftercare, particularly if the treatment had had unfortunate side effects. At the time, the consumer group Which? and the then National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence brought forward reports expressing their concerns about the development of the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/4">In 2005, Frank Cook introduced a Bill in the same form that I am promoting today. The aim was to give the industry the opportunity to address concerns voluntarily, before Government needed to act. Eight years on, I and other hon. Members have been shocked that there are still many incidences of the problems that we then identified. In some cases, they have got worse.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/5">I pay tribute to the public and practitioners who came forward to their MPs to explain how they were treated and to expose current malpractice. I particularly want to pay tribute to Sasha Rodoy, from the My Beautiful Eyes campaign, who has supported many victims of the industry. I do not want to tarnish all practitioners in the field, because there are many good practitioners out there, but confidence will be undermined if we do not tackle the problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/6">Eight years ago, we found that many of the corporates in the sector employed aggressive sales tactics to secure clients. Recent evidence from clients and former salespeople shows that the problem continues and has got worse. It often starts with a phone call, the offer of a time-limited discount or entry into a competition for free treatment. Patients visit the shop on a no-obligation basis for a consultation; then the phone calls start. We have evidence of people receiving 20 phone calls in a single day. Some salesmen are described as counsellors or refractive technicians, but have minimal training in what the surgery involves and come under intense pressure from their managers to clinch deals no matter what. Patients are often not given adequate information on the potential risks. One former Optical Express salesman described pressure from managers not to give customers all the available information for fear of scaring them off.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/7">Material used by some companies to promote sales has been proven on several occasions by the Advertising Standards Authority to be unfounded, lacking in evidence and misleading. In 2011, the ASA upheld 17 complaints against Optical Express brochures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/8">Concerns continue to be expressed about the quality of patient assessment. Assessments are often undertaken by a different person to the surgeon who performs the operation or who provides aftercare&#8212;there is no consistent approach. Good practice in any surgery recommends that a patient&#8217;s consent is assured. A cooling-off period</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/9">is recommended between the assessment and advice provided, and the final decision. Many companies state that a 24-hour or 72-hour cooling-off period is built into consent procedures, but we have evidence that that is not the case. Complex documents are placed in patients&#8217; hands, and they are pressurised into providing a signature on the actual day of the surgery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/10">There is no legal requirement for a surgeon to be qualified or experienced in this field of surgery. There are no regulations to that effect: any doctor can undertake this surgery. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists introduced a certificate in laser surgery, but only half of practising surgeons have it. It is worrying that certification is on a downward trend: in 2009, 29 surgeons took the exam; in 2011, 13; in 2012, five; and this year, none. Worries have been expressed about the number of surgical operations an individual surgeon is contracted to undertake in one day: sometimes 17 to 20, sometimes more. There is no limit on the number of procedures a surgeon can undertake. That puts time pressures on assessments, pre-op procedures, operations and aftercare.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/11">There are definite risks involved in this surgery. Some estimate that one in 20 patients experience post-operative problems, including dry eyes, blurred vision, starbursts and glare. In many cases, patients have found it extremely difficult to secure aftercare from companies. Many are forced to resort to the law, and it takes months&#8212;in some cases, years&#8212;to receive effective remedial action or compensation. On many occasions, they are forced to sign compromise agreements including gagging clauses so that they do not expose what has happened to them. In addition, in some instances they later find that the cost of corrective surgery is deducted from their compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/12">I could go through many case histories, but there is not time to do so. Many hon. Members have also brought cases to my attention. Ex-staff have talked about company patient satisfaction surveys being heavily influenced, or even filled in, by staff. On at least one occasion, an expression of dissatisfaction never came to light. I will quote what one person said to me:</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/13">&#8220;I was misled, misinformed and mis-sold.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/14">What needs to be done? Sir Bruce Keogh, the NHS medical director, examined laser surgery practice in his recent report on cosmetic surgery. He concluded that action needed to be taken to regulate the industry. His report was published in April and the Government are yet to respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/15">The agenda that the Government need to address is set out in Frank Cook&#8217;s Bill, which I have updated. First, the industry needs statutory regulation, as voluntary mechanisms have failed. At minimum, all surgeons must be qualified, certificated and have regular competence assessments from here on in. There should be openness and transparency so that the success rates of individual surgeons and clinics can be published. Patients will then be able to make considered choices. The Government should consider limiting the number of operations that surgeons can undertake in one day: we restrict the hours of lorry drivers and pilots; we should also restrict the hours surgeons work, because patients are being put at risk. We should ensure that high-pressure sales techniques are made illegal in this area. There should be a legal requirement for companies and surgeons to provide full information, in a comprehensible form, on all risks to patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/16">There should also be heavier sanctions for breaches of advertising standards and mis-selling by such companies, because the result of their actions is to expose people to serious health risks. There should be a seven-day breathing space, enforceable in law, between the initial decision and final consent. There should also be guaranteed aftercare and, if things go wrong, remedial action at the expense of the company, not the individual. Finally, there should be a compensation scheme. The mechanism for securing compensation for individuals who suffer loss and damage as a result of such actions should be swifter and less litigious. We have argued this case before, but perhaps it would be easier and less litigious if there was an industry-funded scheme to provide compensation to those who can demonstrate that they have been harmed by such surgery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/17">It is difficult to get a figure for how many such operations take place, but it looks as though between 100,000 and 120,000 people a year undertake such surgery. That is too many people. Even if the figure for those affected is one in 20, as I suggested, that means that thousands of our constituents are being put at risk by an industry that is completely unregulated. I therefore urge the Government to act now. There are many former patients, excellent practitioners and Members of this House who are willing to work with the Government on a programme to secure action based on the Keogh principles, which are about ensuring high standards of service, openness and transparency, accountability and a proper sense of care for such patients in the long term. This is a serious matter. I know that the Government are currently considering their response to Keogh. I hope that it will be imminent and that this part of the cosmetic surgery industry and the surgery industry overall will be covered in that response.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.2/18">A large number of Members wished to support the Bill&#8212;I have had to select a range of Members from different parties and areas in presenting it&#8212;and I thank them for that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1262.0/1">It is a huge pleasure to speak to new clause 1. Let me also say how much I enjoyed serving on the Public Bill Committee, through which we were so well guided by the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40378" name="Philip Dunne">the Member for Ludlow (Mr Dunne)</phrase>. New clause 1 seeks to establish, on a permanent basis, a power for the council of the reserve forces and cadets associations to report annually to this House and the Secretary of State on the state of the Reserves, and will restore to the Reserves a powerful independent voice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.0/2">I hope you will indulge me, Mr Speaker, if I give the House a bit of history. In 1908, when that great reforming Secretary of State, Haldane, set up the Territorial Force, as it was then called, on its modern basis, it was recognised that if the force was established simply under the Regular Army, it would not prosper. Therefore, the county associations&#8212;what we now call the RFCAs&#8212;were given control of recruiting and property management for the TF, as it then was. Just six years later, at the outbreak of the first world war, there were 250,000 Territorials stood to arms. Thirty units went over to the continent in the first wave. Sir John French, our commander over on the continent, remarked:</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.0/3">&#8220;Without the assistance which the Territorials afforded between October 1914 and June 1915, it would have been impossible to hold the line in France and Belgium.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.0/4">Sir John French was of course referring to the beginning of the war, but even at that stage, the same split view, which I am afraid we still see today, existed in the Regular Army. Lord Kitchener, as Secretary of State, announced on the very day that he took up his post that he could</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.0/5">&#8220;take no account of anything but Regular soldiers&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.0/6">He derided the Territorial Force, which was already fighting over in France, as &#8220;a town clerk&#8217;s army&#8221; and said that it got its orders from &#8220;Lord Mayors&#8217; parlours&#8221;. However, had it not been for the vigorous lobbying of Parliament by the county associations&#8212;the forerunners of the RFCAs, with which my new clause deals&#8212;his efforts simply to break up the TF and use it as a source of spare parts for the Regular Army would have been successful, and the remarkable process whereby it delivered almost half our fighting units by the end of the war and scored 71 Victoria Crosses in the process would never have happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.0/7">The system continued for nearly a century. Indeed, in 2003-04, by far the largest deployment of Reservists in post-second world war history took place. At one point, one fifth of all our forces in Iraq and, just afterwards, one eighth of all our forces in Afghanistan were from the Reserves. It is no accident that two years ago the RFCA council elected as its chairman General Sir Robin Brims. The RFCAs elect people to such positions and have a structure that would be recognisable to those in all parts of the House. It is almost like a party structure, although RFCAs are not party political. General Brims commanded the remarkable capture of Basra. Getting into the centre of the city was an almost bloodless exercise and almost the only thing that went seriously right in the British engagement in Iraq. His deputy is Major General Simon Lalor, who is known to a number of people in the House and who headed the Reserves very effectively during the last two years of the Labour Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.1264.1/1">I do not think the gathering of individual statistics should be a statutory matter, but the fact is that the Government have made a perfectly clear pledge that they are going to publish them. The crucial thing from the point of view of the ordinary Reservist is that this body, which is elected by former Reservists and respected by them as a body that effectively looked after their interests for nearly a century, is back with a really crucial position, able to make this report. When it visits the Army Recruiting Group, it will be heard with considerably more authority when it is known that it will be put on a permanent statutory basis and will be able to tell us what is really going on. I would like to say, however, that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase> has taken a close interest in this matter, which I respect.</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/2">The plain fact is that when the Regular Army took over recruiting in 2006, the numbers collapsed. The collecting of statistics collapsed, too, and the structure made no serious effort to address the challenges it was taking on. It simply raided the budget and used it for Regulars. To provide just one example, from 2006 to this day&#8212;it is now seven years on&#8212;Army recruiting offices are open only from 9 to 5.30 Monday to Friday, so they are not even available for people with civilian jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/3">A number of other things happened at the same time. There was a steady reduction in the flow of equipment to the Reserves. There was a huge cut in the training budget. In 2009, we almost lost the whole training budget for the Reserves for six months, and I pay tribute to a small number of colleagues on both sides of the House who supported us in that battle. Worst of all, from 2009, all deployments of formed bodies to Afghanistan stopped&#8212;echoing the argument that had taken place at the outset of the first world war&#8212;and units were effectively told, &#8220;You are just here to act as part-time personnel agencies for the Regular Army&#8221;. That really destroyed much of the Territorial Army&#8217;s officer corps.</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/4">I strongly support what the Government are trying to do with the Reserves. The House will know how much I am in favour of a rebalancing. I also commend many things that have taken place: the equipment is improving; there has been a huge increase in the funds available for training, particularly for collective training; and there have been some interesting initiatives at Sandhurst, under the charismatic leadership of the recently departed Commandant, General Tim Evans. He started a number of improvements in officer training, one of which was the personal brain child of the Chief of the General Staff&#8212;taking people through the training in a single eight-week package, timed to coincide with the summer vacation in universities. The pairing of units is another initiative.</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/5">The Army Recruiting Group, however, has not got its act together; it is every bit as disorganised as it has always been. I hope the House will forgive me if I give just one example in detail to show just how hopeless it is. When the RFCAs lost their recruiting brief, the requirement for medicals, which had been very efficiently organised, disappeared. Suddenly last year, as part of</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/6">common selection, it was announced that the Territorials were to do medicals, too. A system was set up, using the NHS as the old one had done, but in a fashion that had not even been cleared by the lawyers in relation to the Data Protection Act 1998. It was completely unworkable. People were told to take a form to their GP and get him to sign it off and send it in. So inefficient was this system that GPs did not know what to do. If units rang up to see what was going on, they were breaching the Data Protection Act. The system was so hopeless that a unit I know well&#8212;for obvious reasons, I will not say which&#8212;that had had an average of 48 successful enlistees per quarter in the months up to that change, saw a rising trend in applicants turn into just eight enlistees per quarter in the subsequent quarters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1264.1/7">I could go on and on. The software is unworkable; Ministers have already acknowledged that. Unfortunately, that compounds the problems at the recruiting centres. Because it is de facto impossible for somebody to do the form online on their own&#8212;if they make one mistake, their application is lost in cyberspace&#8212;it has to be done either at recruiting centres or in the units. The recruiting centres, of course, are not available.</p>

I give great credit to my hon. Friend for his perseverance throughout the Committee stage; he attended as much as he possibly could and provided helpful background to our understanding of the Bill. My question to him is this: does he find it as interesting as I do that it has taken this Bill to show what a mess all the previous discrepancies were?</p>

It does not work. There is no reserve army anywhere in the world that is effectively run by its regular counterpart. We need a strong independent body. This new clause, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has generously said he will accept, will put the body that used to do this job very effectively into a powerful position as inspectors.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way again. I cannot resist following up the intervention of our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40105" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)</phrase>. When I went to Upavon a couple of weeks ago, I found that a number of limbless ex-Afghanistan veterans had been integrated into the call centre and were managing the online process. I noted that they were able to use their own military experience to encourage and support the young recruits whom they were mentoring online.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267.1/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right to make that point. Not only is it good for the veterans to be integrated into the call centre while remaining in a military environment, but, crucially, the fact that the job is being done by people with military experience makes a huge difference. That is a message which, in a different context, I have tried to get across to our police force in Kent from time to time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1267.1/2">I do not want to speak for too long, because a great many other Members wish to contribute to the debate, but I should like to look abroad for a moment. It is no accident that the Haldane reforms came just after similar reforms in America which established the National Guard Bureau, just three years before the power was given to the forerunners of the RFCAs by the House of Commons. I have been privileged to visit National Guard units on operations in Afghanistan, and to see them doing various kinds of work. One airborne cavalry unit was mentoring the police, and an infantry unit from Virginia&#8212;whose origins, incidentally, date back to before American independence&#8212;was deploying its platoons along the Pakistani border, protecting aid posts there. Those units were able to bring to those jobs something that regular soldiers could not have brought to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1267.1/3">&#8220;Losing Small Wars&#8221; is a book by Frank Ledwidge, who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan. It refers to a catalogue of things that went wrong with the British presence in Iraq and, in the early years, in Afghanistan. One of the saddest aspects of the book is that it paints a picture of the Army not as it used to be, when it was quintessentially good at dealing with civilian populations all over the world. The fact that our Army was entirely unable to relate to the population in Iraq&#8212;in particular, it failed to recognise the murderous nature of the Iraqi police&#8212;was fundamental to our problems there. By contrast, National Guard units, which contain, for instance, police officers, business men and farmers, related very well to their local areas.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267.2/1">I must challenge my hon. Friend at this point. In fact, the experience in Iraq was often that the British Territorial Army units had considerably more expertise than the National Guard units. In al-Amarah, for example, they had water engineers serving as majors and development specialists serving as corporals. I think that we should take much more pride in what the TA was able to do in Iraq, often outperforming the National Guard units on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="b.1267.3/1">I am delighted that my hon. Friend has intervened and put me right. I was not drawing a parallel between the National Guard and the British TA. By the stage when things were starting to unravel, the TA deployment, which had been large at the beginning,</p>
	<p pid="b.1267.3/2">was very small. It is true that the TA punched above its weight. I have heard General Abraham, who currently leads the transition process, pay tribute to a military police TA sub-unit which was briefly under his command, while also making the point that it was only briefly: the presence was all-Regular most of the time. However, because at one stage just over half the American deployment consisted of Reservists, and because, typically, the Regulars would capture the ground&#8212;and provided the surge&#8212;but the National Guard would hold ground, it was possible to introduce a range of different skills across a much larger number of people. Given my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency, I could refer to agriculture and the role that the farmers in the National Guard played, most of them in infantry combat units rather than specialist units.</p>
	<p pid="b.1267.3/3">Let me now say a little about new clause 2, which, I hasten to add, I shall not be pressing, as it could not possibly become law. It is merely an attempt to initiate a short debate about property.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for giving way. I had hoped to speak in the debate, but those of us who are serving on a Committee will not be able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1268.0/2">Before my hon. Friend moves on to new clause 2, may I make a point about new clause 1? The principle behind the change in the proportion of Reserves to Regulars was exactly right: it brought us into line with many more contemporary countries. The proviso, in practice, was that the reduction in the number of Regulars would not take place until we saw the necessary improvements in training, equipping and numbers in the Reserves. The problem for the House of Commons was that we had very little information to go on when it came to assessing the decision. I therefore congratulate my hon. Friend on tabling new clause 1, which will provide the transparency that will enable the House to make that assessment. I also congratulate my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on his wisdom in accepting a new clause that will give the House a good deal more pertinent information than it would have had otherwise.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268.1/1">I am most grateful to my right hon. Friend for his tribute. I understand how strongly he and a number of other Members feel about the timing of the decision. However, although he and I&#8212;and, I am sure, the Secretary of State in his private heart of hearts&#8212;would like more money to be spent on defence, it is a question of the cash envelope within which any Government are likely to operate. If we wound up the whole Territorial Army tomorrow, it would be possible to pay for only 6,000 or 7,000 regulars rather than 20,000, and that would mean losing most of our medical capability as well as a number of other benefits.</p>

	<p pid="b.1268.2/1">I accept what my hon. Friend has said about the MOD&#8217;s cash envelope, but surely this comes down to national priorities. The plan was not to wind down the regulars to such a degree without first ensuring that the reservists could take their place, but the plan has changed. None of the new clauses and amendments are asking for extra money from the MOD. It is, as I have said, a question of national priorities: it is a question of whether more money should be committed to defence, which is the first priority of Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269.0/1">I will respond to my hon. Friend&#8217;s intervention, but I hope he will forgive me if I leave it for a couple of minutes. I shall deal briefly with new clause 2, and then I shall come to his new clause.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.0/2">Ever since Haldane, the Reserve properties of the Army, but not all those of the other two services, have been managed largely by the RFCA. The fact is that the Defence Infrastructure Organisation&#8212;or the Defence Estates, as it used to be called&#8212;has a poor track record. There are so many quotations available that I am spoilt for choice, but according to the latest report from the National Audit Office,</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.0/3">&#8220;Defence Estates is not well placed to weigh up and challenge Budget Holders assessments of estate requirements.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.0/4">While I am certain that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and his team will sort out the problems, two quite different jobs are involved. We do not want an organisation whose job is to look after super-garrisons to be worrying about repairing the roof of a cadet hut. The vast number of locations&#8212;2,500&#8212;across which reserves and cadets are spread need to be looked after by a local organisation with local feel, which can call on local expertise, often free of charge, and which, above all, has a low overhead. As I have said, new clause 2 could not become law, but I wanted to put those points on the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.0/5">I now come to the new clause tabled by my hon. and gallant Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron)</phrase>, who has fought a very good-tempered campaign, and one that I respect although I disagree with him. It is no secret that I stepped down as a Cabinet Parliamentary Private Secretary 20 years ago because I was unhappy about &#8220;Options for Change&#8221;. I would dearly love to see more money spent on defence, and I know that my hon. Friend would as well, but the reality is that the money is not there. Despite all the Secretary of State&#8217;s battles, the fact remains that no Treasury team that is likely to take charge will give us more money. The effect of my hon. Friend&#8217;s new clause would be not to guarantee a larger Regular Army, but to devastate our attempts to rebuild the reserve forces by putting them all on hold.</p>
	<p pid="b.1269.0/6">My hon. Friend must be familiar with his own wording. Are we to push to one side the plans for better training and better equipment? Are reservists, many of whom have served on operations and have struggled through a difficult period with no kit and no training, suddenly to be told. &#8220;This has all been put on hold, because the House of Commons wants it all to be looked at again&#8221;? The people to look at it are the RFCAs, and the Secretary of State has generously said that he will arrange for that to happen.</p>

	<p pid="b.1269.1/1">My hon. Friend is being very generous in giving way, and I appreciate the tone in which he is setting out his case, but may I address his central point by reminding him that the delay or postponement&#8212;the pause&#8212;need not be long at all because the report could be laid before Parliament the day after the Bill becomes an Act and then it is up to the Government to decide how promptly we can scrutinise that report? The pause may not be long at all, and as for all the other comments about wrecking amendments and that this would turn the plans upside down, they are wide of the mark&#8212;they are Aunt Sallies&#8212;that do not do the Government&#8217;s cause any good.</p>

I know this is not his intention, but if Parliament passes his amendment, that will strike a hammer-blow to morale in the TA. Many Members on both sides of the House are concerned about the future of the Reserve forces. Many Labour Members fought very hard when we were having the battles towards the end of the last Labour Government, and I am delighted that the former Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40185" name="Bob Ainsworth">the right hon. Member for Coventry North East (Mr Ainsworth)</phrase>, is present, as he took a very close personal interest in this, and I note that the problems that arose at the end were not of his making.

	<p pid="b.1270.2/2">I want to bring my remarks to an end as many other Members wish to speak. A number of noteworthy people have come through the Territorials and the other Reserves&#8212;I have said nothing yet about the RAF and Naval Reserves. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State&#8217;s Parliamentary Private Secretary, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40485" name="Penny Mordaunt">the Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt)</phrase>, was recently commissioned into the Royal Naval Reserve and the Air Force Reserves heritage goes back to two of the three highest scoring fighter squadrons in the battle of Britain. The Reserves have produced a number of distinguished individuals, including the grandfather of my right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Sussex, Sir Winston Churchill, and our greatest general in the last war, Bill Slim. People fondly imagine he was a Regular officer who went to Sandhurst. He was not; he was a Territorial who sneaked in through the back door of the Birmingham officer training corps because his brother was a student there and nobody realised he was not a student too. There is also David Stirling, who founded the SAS. Again, people think of him as a Scots Guards officer. Yes, he was; he was a Scots Guards Reservist. He had done his officer training at Ampleforth combined cadet force and then, through mountaineering, he had developed the qualities of character and team leadership that were so vital for setting up the SAS.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.2/3">There are three reasons why we need Reservists. First, because we can keep far more capability if we keep some of it at much lower cost&#8212;about a fifth of the cost&#8212;at lower readiness. Secondly, because they bring the energies, extra skills and imaginations of the wider civilian community into the armed forces. Thirdly, because that keeps the link with the local communities, which just after Remembrance Sunday we should all remember.</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.2/4">New clause 1 will give a strong independent voice back to the Reserves. I am very grateful to the Government for accepting it and I must ask the House once more not to be persuaded by my hon. Friend the Member for</p>
	<p pid="b.1270.2/5">Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron) on new clause 3, because that will send a devastating message to the Reserve forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.1271.0/1">I am a signatory to new clause 1, and I want to make a simple statement about its power. It will provide an independent element to the scrutiny of the whole process that comes back to Parliament. The debates that we will now have about new clause 3 and other things must be based on the truth on the ground; they must be based on the reality and an understanding so as to inform the decision-making properly. This amendment is about doing that and also about cementing consent from the public and involvement of the public in building the consensus that we require to develop the quality of reserve recruitment into the Army, RAF and Navy and to make a whole force that is properly integrated. If we do not have that consent, we will not achieve that. If the amendment helps to provide that, it will be valuable and important. I am glad some Damascene conversion has taken place and the Government have now recognised the sense in accepting the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="b.1271.1/1">New clause 3 and consequential amendments tabled in my name and that of other hon. Members will, if successful, postpone the implementation of the Government&#8217;s reservist plans until their viability and cost-effectiveness have been scrutinised and accepted by Parliament. I should clarify what these amendments are not about, because a number of Aunt Sallys have been proposed by various interested parties. Contrary to some claims and inferences, these are not wrecking amendments; they are not designed to scupper, reverse or tear up the Army reserve plans, and they are certainly not an attempt to recreate, or go back to, Victorian-style and size armies. These arguments are Aunt Sallys that do not do the Government&#8217;s cause any good.</p>
	<p pid="b.1271.1/2">I also want to make it clear that if these amendments are passed the delay to the Army reserve plans could be kept to an absolute minimum if the Government allowed prompt scrutiny of the report. There is no intention to drag this out or turn it into a campaign that goes on for months and months. The report could be produced the day after the Bill becomes an Act and we could have a debate in this place within weeks. I have to say that the stories that this is scuppering the Army reserve plans or reversing them are very wide of the mark.</p>

	<p pid="b.1271.2/1">As the House may imagine, my hon. Friend and I have discussed these issues at some length. I think he will acknowledge that while a debate could be held in short order the requirement is for the Government to carry the House at the end of that debate. Will my hon. Friend acknowledge that the Government would have to get that vote through before we could progress with the reserves agenda, and setting out that hurdle today would send a negative signal to the reserves community, which has heard a message of reinvigoration and growth for the future?</p>

	<p pid="b.1271.3/1">I will very directly answer both those questions. I completely agree that the report the Government would submit would be subject to the scrutiny of this House and a vote, but the fact that the Secretary of State seems concerned about that points to a bigger story about the reforms. If the Government are concerned</p>
	<p pid="b.1271.3/2">that they might not carry the House as to the logic of their report, I suggest that that shows a weak point. I therefore suggest that the Secretary of State should, perhaps, not pursue that argument for too long, because for the Government not to accept this amendment because they are concerned they might not be able to carry the House tells a bigger story.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272.0/1">I am very concerned about that point because if the Government are saying they think they have real problems with this and they might not carry Parliament, the Executive are trying to implement something that Parliament does not approve of, and that is totally unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. The restructuring of other areas of government, such as the NHS, has been subject to the scrutiny of this place, yet here we are undertaking a major restructuring&#8212;the Secretary of State cannot disagree with that&#8212;of the Army and we are not prepared to subject it to that scrutiny, apparently for fear that we might not carry the House. It is not a very good reason.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272.3/1">I very much agree. I sometimes think in this place, where there is no shortage of former serving soldiers, that Front Benchers can be a little too sensitive about how stoical troops are. Their job is to get on with it, particularly if they are professional soldiers. They know these debates are taking place, but they get on with the job in hand, because that is what they are paid to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.1272.4/1">Would my hon. Friend not accept, though, that there is no attempt to avoid scrutiny here? By indicating that I will accept the intention of our hon. Friends&#8217; new clause 1 and legislate to require an annual independent report&#8212;not for a limited period, but as a permanent arrangement&#8212;we are in effect creating a mechanism whereby annually the House will receive a progress report on the state of the reserves, and I would expect the House to debate that progress report. That will provide the level of scrutiny that he seeks. What we cannot accept is the destabilisation of the programme that introducing an artificial hurdle&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1272.5/1">Order. Interventions need to be brief. The Secretary of State is an experienced Member of the House, and he knows that. Also, it would be good if he addressed the whole House, particularly the Chair, not just <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the hon.

	<p pid="b.1272.6/1">What the Secretary of State cannot get away from, however, is that this is not that sort of report. It would be the equivalent of a speech to the House followed by questions; it would not be subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny and a vote. We are talking about proper scrutiny of the plans. We know that things are not going well. Reservist recruitment targets are being badly missed, TA numbers are falling, there is a widening capability gap as a result and we have deviated</p>
	<p pid="b.1272.6/2">from the original plan, as was just clearly confirmed by the former Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase>; the original plan was to maintain the regulars until the reservists could take their place, but that has now been scrapped, and as we keep missing the reservist recruitment targets, the capability gap gets ever wider. These are legitimate questions that we in Parliament should be asking, and we need proper scrutiny of the answers the Government are giving. At the end of the day, that is all we are asking for.</p>
	<p pid="b.1272.6/3">As I have said, the report on its own is not enough, because we need proper scrutiny and a vote in the House, and if it does not bear scrutiny, perhaps that tells a wider story. A number of us, on both sides of the House, have tabled these amendments because we have deep-seated concerns that we believe have not been adequately addressed by the Government. I take no pleasure from saying this, but that includes the response to a well-attended general debate in the Chamber only a few weeks ago, when the Government could not muster one single vote in support of their position. One reason was that we put forward a series of questions, but very few, if any, answers came back.</p>

	<p pid="b.1273.0/1">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s points about scrutiny might be well-intentioned, but new clause 3 talks about further implementation of the plans being halted. What would be the implication for the process already under way of giving reservists access to the armed forces pension scheme? What signal would it send to our reservists if we practically halted the implementation of a widely supported measure to give them better pension provision?</p>

	<p pid="b.1273.1/1">My hon. Friend will just have to accept that we are suggesting a brief pause. Why should Parliament not be able to ask for a brief pause in a process that is clearly not going to plan, with recruitment targets being missed, an ever-widening capability gap and rising costs? If we all accept that defence is the first duty of Government, which I know we do, it is incumbent on Parliament to ask these questions.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase> that his campaign has been conducted in an extremely measured way. My difficulty with his new clause is that I think it addresses a point he is not that interested in. I think he wants to reduce or stop the running down of the regulars, yet, so far as I can see, his new clause would stop the beneficial changes to the reserves that all of us&#8212;including him, I suspect&#8212;want to see.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> for his kind words, but let us be clear: there have been three major tranches of redundancies in the regulars already. I think a fourth one is due shortly, although I do not know the</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.4/2">Secretary of State&#8217;s exact intention on that. The plan to replace 20,000 regulars with 30,000 reservists essentially hinges on our ability to recruit those reservists, but the plan is clearly in trouble, and if we do not stop now, if only briefly, to re-examine the logic and ensure it stands up and properly scrutinise the viability and cost-effectiveness of the plan and the widening capability gap, we risk heading towards false economies and unacceptable capability gaps, which people will not thank us for. It is not unwise, therefore, to say, &#8220;Pause briefly and let Parliament properly scrutinise these plans.&#8221;</p>

The problems with recruitment are not about footfall, as I set out in my speech. What message does my hon.

	<p pid="b.1274.1/2">On the effect of my new clause on the morale of the TA, let us consider the present situation. The latest figures, which came out last Thursday, show TA numbers falling, not rising, despite all the expensive recruitment programmes. Then we have the figures&#8212;and they are not full figures either; some of them were actually missing&#8212;for reserve recruitment going forward. I can tell my hon. Friend that it has got to such a state that the Army Reserve and TA courses scheduled for next January and February have had to be cancelled owing to a lack of recruits. The Secretary of State may be willing to check that, because I heard it very recently in one&#8212;in fact, more than one&#8212;of the texts and e-mails that my hon. Friend keeps mentioning. That shows the current state of recruitment. I therefore suggest to my hon. Friend that there are fundamental problems with this plan and it is only right that Parliament should scrutinise it more carefully.</p>

The last reservist I dealt with before coming to the debate&#8212;he is one of the cleverest members of the TA and the kind of person who should be its future&#8212;has a brother trying to join the TA who, for 13 months, has had his paperwork lost in the hopeless regulars system.

These plans are not working and a series of things are going wrong, and it merely says, &#8220;Let&#8217;s pause for a moment to make sure that the plans stand up to scrutiny in terms of viability and cost-effectiveness so that rising costs do not lead to false economies and we are not opening up ever-widening capability gaps.&#8221; I am afraid that my hon. Friend is not quite fair in ascribing such a motive to me.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/2">One of the first questions I would like the Secretary of State to answer is why the plan has changed. As we heard from the former Secretary of State in his own words&#8212;it came from his mouth, not mine&#8212;the original plan was that the Regulars would be held at their current level until the Reservists were able to take their place. That plan has changed. To return to a point that several Members have already made, by the end of last year a good number of the Regulars had already gone&#8212;the</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/3">final tranche may be next year; we are not sure&#8212;and by the end of next year most of the Regular units and battalions will have been disbanded. Meanwhile, the Reservists are not due to reach adequate strength to take their place until 2018, if present plans are met, but there is every indication that, because we are struggling, we will not even achieve that. That was not the original plan, as the former Secretary of State said. It would be good if, for once, we could get an adequate answer to this question, because we have asked it many times in this House and have not got one.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/4">Let me talk about the recruitment problems. Last Thursday, figures confirmed yet again that TA numbers are in decline&#8212;not rising, but in decline. We also know that the Army Reserve recruitment targets are being badly missed, as confirmed in a spate of reports, some derived from leaked MOD documents. Figures due last Thursday regarding Army Reserve recruitment were not released in full. It is clear that the required recruits are not coming forward and that computer problems have added to the problems, as confirmed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>. As everybody can imagine, there has been no shortage of texts and e-mails about this debate, and I have learned in such messages from the north-east that raw recruits to the Reserve have been told that it could take up to 15 months for them to get into uniform once they sign up. These are the sorts of delays we are talking about and which Parliament has every right properly to scrutinise. As even the Secretary of State may not be aware, the Army Reserve courses for January and February have had to be cancelled in their entirety because of lack of recruits. The fact that the Government are offering significant payments to businesses underlines the reluctance of many businesses, particularly smaller businesses, to let valued and key employees go on more frequent and extended deployments. All that is part of the cycle which in itself is adding to costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/5">Our concerns are not just about Reserve targets not being met; we also have deep-seated concerns about the resulting capability and manpower gaps, which are getting worse as we miss the Reserve recruitment targets. Let us take as an example the mobilisation rate. At present, the MOD confirms that the TA mobilisation rate is 40%. In other words, for every 100 Reservists there are on paper, the MOD deems that 40 are deployable. That can be to do with fitness, kit, sickness or all sorts of reasons. In order to make the Army Reserve plans work, the mobilisation rate has to double from 40% to 80%. I see nothing in the plans about how that massive increase in the mobilisation rate can be justified or whether it has been costed. It is a massive ask to go from 40% to 80% mobilisation. These questions need to be answered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/6">There are also concerns about the plan risking capability gaps. The nature of conflict is changing. Many countries that are not necessarily friendly to the west are increasing their military spending, and war is becoming more asymmetrical. Gone are the days of binary conflicts involving good guys versus bad guys&#8212;terrorism has ensured that things are much more complex nowadays&#8212;and we need professional, mobile, high-readiness, agile forces that are ready to respond to the threats that we face.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/7">The encroachment of the Human Rights Act 1998 also puts pressure on the plans, because we will now have to ensure that the same standard of training and</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/8">equipment is available to reservists on deployment as is available to regulars. It is not clear whether the extra cost of that has been accommodated, given recent developments&#8212;this is a relatively recent ruling. It is no wonder that ex-military chiefs are worried, with many suggesting that strategic thought has been abandoned. These are questions to which we need answers.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/9">Our concern must also focus on the real possibility that rising costs and flawed assumptions could easily lead to false economies. I suggest that the Government have yet to produce a fully costed plan, and that is what lies at the heart of new clause 3. It is clear that costs are rising: the extra resources being poured into boosting Reservist recruitment are an example. In addition to that, and to the extra payments to small and medium-sized enterprises, other rising costs include the &#163;5,000 bonus, the Reservist award, pensions and mental health costs. To the best of my knowledge, none of this has been properly costed. The charity Combat Stress has said that Reservists are twice as likely as Regulars to suffer from some kind of mental disorder, but I am not sure that that kind of extra cost has been fully accounted for in the plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/10">We should also question the underlying assumptions in the Army Reserve&#8217;s plans. I think the Secretary of State is willing to admit that it costs more to deploy Reservists than to deploy Regulars. I do not think that there is any disagreement on that. It is therefore crucial, in costing the plans, to identify the central case regarding projected usage rates. The lower the rates, the lower the cost will appear, because, as I have said, it costs more to deploy Reservists than Regulars.</p>
	<p pid="b.1275.5/11">Let us look at the figures in the impact assessment. The case for deploying Reservists centres on the figure of 3,000 annual deployments. That sounds somewhat low, given that the original purpose of the plan was to replace 20,000 Regulars with 30,000 Reservists, and that we would be using those Reservists more frequently. Here, however, we have a projected usage rate of 3,000 annual deployments. Of course it will bring the projected cost down if we artificially bring usage rates down.</p>

	<p pid="b.1277.0/1">My hon. Friend is making an interesting argument. At its core is whether those on the Front Bench made a promise to increase the size of the TA before the Regulars were downsized. Did he ever hear the Secretary of State say that he would guarantee that that number of Reservists would be recruited before the Regulars were downsized by the proposed number?</p>

	<p pid="b.1277.1/1">I am pleased that my hon. Friend has asked that question. It completely misses the point, and illustrates the weakness of the Front-Bench position. I am not saying for one moment that the present Secretary of State has said anything other than what he has said. My point is that the plan under the previous Secretary of State was very different only two years ago. I do not want to labour this point, but we heard from my right hon. Friend the Member for North Somerset no more than half an hour ago that the original plan was not to wind down the Regulars until the Reservists were able to take their place. We heard that from his own lips. I do not want to enter into a war of words between the present and former Secretary of State, but we know that the plan has changed over the past couple of years, and that is another reason for scrutinising it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1278.0/1">Going back to the cost of deploying Reservists, the Government have said that they want to increase the percentage who are deployable at any given time from 40% to 80%. &#8220;Deployable&#8221; does not necessarily mean that they would be ready to be deployed in theatre, however. In many cases, it will mean that they are ready to begin training. I had five months of additional training before I was deployed in theatre. That kind of training involves additional costs, as does the Reservist award, so this is not quite so clear-cut as the Secretary of State suggests.</p>

	<p pid="b.1278.1/1">I completely agree with my hon. Friend. To double the mobilisation is a big enough challenge. The plan represents a fundamental change in another respect, which provides a further reason to scrutinise it in some detail. I am proud to have served alongside TA soldiers, but the bottom line is that they were in large part in-filling. We helped each other along.</p>

	<p pid="b.1279.0/1">I have made it clear that I shall be taking no more interventions. I think that hon.

We also need to address another important group of amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1279.0/2">The Government&#8217;s Army Reserve plans raise many questions on recruitment problems, assumed mobilisation rates and rising costs which could lead to false economies, but one of my greatest concerns is the ever-widening capability gaps that could result from the proposals. If passed, new clause 3 would confirm that the time had come for Parliament properly to scrutinise the Government&#8217;s plans. There comes a stage in any struggling project when the evidence and common sense suggest, and perhaps demand, a rethink. We have reached that stage with these plans.</p>
	<p pid="b.1279.0/3">If the Government are confident about their plans&#8212;that is what Ministers claim, and I have no problem with that&#8212;they should not be afraid of the new clause. Let them present their plans to Parliament, and if their case is as strong as they think it is, Parliament will allow the plans to be passed and the reforms will carry on as intended. However, I urge all Members to support new clause 3 and consequential amendments 3 and 4. I shall seek to press new clause 3 to a vote.</p>

	<p pid="b.1279.1/1">I offer profound congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>, not just for the concession he has achieved today but for the formidable way he has pursued this issue over the years. He harassed me when I was in office&#8212;I perhaps remember that with a fondness I never felt at the time&#8212;and has continued to harass his own Government and the defence establishment on the issue of the Reserves and the role they can play in the country&#8217;s defence. No matter who wants to claim credit for some of the changes now being brought about, he can feel real satisfaction at something very few Back Benchers can say they have been able to do: profoundly to change a significant area of Government policy. He has most certainly done that through his work on the Reserves over the years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1279.1/2">I totally support the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s new clause 1 and am enormously pleased that the Secretary of State has accepted it. I also support new clause 3, and I have to say that I believe the Secretary of State is being a little heavy-handed in suggesting that to support it is somehow to sabotage the direction of the Army or to play politics with the defence of the realm. I say that as a former Secretary of State who had to put up with allegations by the then loyal Opposition that I had deliberately delayed life-saving vehicles getting to our troops in Afghanistan. It is enormously important&#8212;particularly in the field of defence, where there is such a degree of cross-party support&#8212;that the Government&#8217;s own defence of their policies is somewhat measured, but I am not at all sure it has been in this regard. We can all read: we can see what new clause 3 says and does not say. As I say, my respect for the hon. Member for Canterbury is about as high as an Opposition Member&#8217;s can be for a Government Member, and I have not heard from him, or from anybody else here today, anything to suggest that the new clause does all the terrible things it is said to bring about.</p>
	<p pid="b.1279.1/3">New clause 3 calls for a report within a particular time frame after the Bill has been enacted, and a pause if Parliament does not accept it. It does no more than</p>

This development could, potentially, bring about huge improvements in capability. I see nothing to justify the counter-argument that is being made.</p>

What we need to be assured of&#8212;but which this House, largely, is not confident we have&#8212;is that the Government&#8217;s plans will provide us with the necessary numbers, competency and capability. That is what the pause is about. It is not a throwing away of the plan: it is a pause.</p>

	<p pid="b.1280.5/1">The growth of the Reserve element in all the services has huge potential benefits, such as a connection with the population at large that the small Regular armed forces that we inevitably have today and will have tomorrow can never achieve on its own. Equally, as other Members have said, it brings skills into the</p>
	<p pid="b.1280.5/2">armed forces that cannot be kept up to date within the Regulars themselves. So there are those potential improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1280.5/3">Government Members have talked about a potential gap of three years, but it is not just a question of that: I am worried about the potential ongoing downgrading of capability if we do not get this right. In order to get into the Reserves the calibre of people that will be absolutely necessary for the kind of operations we have unfortunately had to carry out in recent years, and will undoubtedly have to carry out in future, the skills required by every rank must not only remain at their current level, but must improve. That is for the obvious and simple reason, which everybody knows, that the huge reputational damage to such operations, to our armed forces and to our nation, of errors in such operations can be profound. We must therefore ensure, given the cut-backs that are inevitably taking place, that we maintain within the Regulars the quality of not only the original recruits but of the training given to them, in order to lift capability. We are blessed with armed forces with a capability level that, in some ways, is higher than that in any other nation on earth, in my opinion, but it will need to be higher still.</p>

	<p pid="b.1281.0/1">I have a lot of respect for the right hon. Gentleman and the experience he gained as Secretary of State, but I genuinely worry that he is fighting the last war. The conduct of warfare has changed. I hope he would agree that we will not be doing &#8220;boots on the ground&#8221; in the manner in which we have done so badly in Afghanistan and Iraq. The size of armed forces concertinas&#8212;it has done so over the past 400 years. I hope he would agree that withdrawal from Afghanistan will have a huge impact on the size of the standing Army, both Regular and Territorial, and batting for the old numbers that we had five years ago is out of touch.</p>

	<p pid="b.1281.1/1">I totally accept that. I like to study history and I know that after conflicts, the services&#8212;generally the Army more than the other services, but those, too&#8212;have generally been decimated in times of peace, only to have to be regenerated in times of danger thereafter. So I am not trying to fight the last war. I am saying that as we struggle with these enormous economic challenges and the cuts that are almost inevitable, we have to do everything we can to maintain the quality of our personnel. That applies to the Regular forces as it applies to the Reserves. Even at a time of downsizing, we can surely do that&#8212;we have to try to do it because of the reputational damage that inevitably flows from our failure to do so. There is nothing &#8220;yesterday&#8221; or &#8220;last war&#8221; about that approach; this is about the kind of operations we could be involved in tomorrow, of whatever scale, and the need for quality personnel.</p>
	<p pid="b.1281.1/2">New clause 3 calls for a level of scrutiny that is wholly justified by the importance of the decisions, and the changes of direction and structure, that we are implementing and that the hon. Member for Canterbury has fought for so valiantly and successfully for so long. That is why I support it, even if he does not.</p>

Quite apart from that, it is a good thing for Governments to keep their promises. However, I thought I should briefly tell the House why I shall be voting with the Government tonight. First, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase> said, although new clause 3 highlights the problem, it does not provide the answer.

	<p pid="b.1282.2/1">My proposal does not mention the Regulars because the Bill is about the Reservists. A couple of hon. Members have suggested motives for these proposals which I cannot agree with. The bottom line is that most of those Regulars&#8212;this is my understanding and I am willing to stand corrected&#8212;have been disbanded in any case. Let me be clear about what my proposal says, because motives that I do not take kindly to are being attributed to it. The proposal is about saying that these plans are not working and we should take time, if only a brief amount of it, to scrutinise them properly to check for their viability and cost-effectiveness. That is the right thing to do&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1282.4/1">As I am coming on to discuss the Reserves and why I think they are so important, I should perhaps declare an interest, in that my daughter is a second lieutenant in the Territorial Army. I think it is essential that we should change the Reserves, boosting them, their numbers, their training and the equipment available to them. As a Defence Minister in the previous Conservative Government, I thought that that Government went too far in reducing the Reserves, and I think that the previous Labour Government made the situation worse. It is high time that we begin again to build up and properly resource the Reserves. I wish to pay particular tribute to two people, the first of whom is my right hon. and gallant Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40397" name="Nicholas Soames">the Member for Mid Sussex (Nicholas Soames)</phrase>. When he was Minister of State for the Armed Forces, he valiantly championed the Territorials and found himself fighting rather a losing battle.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282.4/2">Even more, I wish to congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, who, as a Back Bencher&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40185" name="Bob Ainsworth">the right hon. Member for Coventry North East (Mr Ainsworth)</phrase> made the point&#8212;has achieved more in</p>
	<p pid="b.1282.4/3">supporting and championing the Reserves than I or my right hon. Friend the Member for Mid Sussex did, when we were Ministers. My hon. Friend&#8217;s contribution to the Reserves debate deserves an immediate dukedom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282.4/4" class="italic">[Interruption.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1282.4/5">Yes, a dukedom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1282.4/6">The Reserves bring incredible value to this country. They bring vital specialist skills which are made contemporary by their civilian lives and they bring those skills to a changing world where they are essential. Crucially, as my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury said, the Reserves also tie the civilian world into the military world in a way that is becoming increasingly needed day by day. May I aim a shaft at my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State by saying that his clampdown on informal discussion between the military and politicians rather flies in the face of that need?</p>
	<p pid="b.1282.4/7">My second reason for supporting the Government is that wars are changing. We are increasingly less likely to see tank battles in Germany and increasingly more likely to be facing the emerging threats of cyber-attack, piracy and the covert destruction of our critical national infrastructure&#8212;the sort of things to which extra battalions of any particular regiment would not be the answer.</p>

	<p pid="b.1283.0/1">My right hon. Friend is making an important point about cyber-security capability. Is not one of the strong arguments for Reserve forces that a lot of skills reside in the private sector, in things such as cyber-security and dealing with cyber-attack, which need to be brought into the armed forces? That is a strong argument for continuing to develop Reserve forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.1283.1/1">My hon. Friend is right about that. The new cyber-command that has recently been brought on stream will achieve precisely what he describes. It will not be possible to achieve that expertise within a purely military environment; we have to rely on those who have civilian expertise, too. Because of all this, we will need new investment, in satellites and in software&#8212;in the sort of things that will not be visible to the man in the street&#8212;all at the same time as we are trying to sell to the public increased spending on defence. That will be difficult to achieve while we are reducing in Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.1283.3/1">Indeed. My hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency experience is very important in this.</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.3/2">The money for the investment to deal with emerging threats and emerging skills has to come from somewhere. I make no secret of the fact that I would like to see increased spending on defence. However, it is wholly unrealistic to expect that when every extra pound going on defence has to be added to an already increasing national debt. The Government are bringing down not the national debt but the rate at which it is going up. We cannot expect to have increased spending on defence, so money has to come from within the defence budget. That means reducing both waste and people. I hate</p>
	<p pid="b.1283.3/3">saying that, but it is real life. I do not want any pause in the boosting of Reserves. I want the building up of both them and their proper resources.</p>

I do not believe that the Minister has thought enough about that particular impact. One reason for a pause is so that the Secretary of State, through you, Madam Speaker, can relook at his whole connection with small and medium-sized businesses. He should look at the incentives that are given, because they are simply nowhere near enough.</p>

	<p pid="b.1284.6/1">I hesitate to follow the peroration of the right hon. Gentleman, the Chair of the Defence Committee, but as always, we were informed by his remarks. I know that whatever his view on the amendments before us, his suggestion of a national debate and conversation about how to change the culture with respect to the Reserves and to drive it forward in a national effort is one well made, and I think the whole House agrees with him.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.6/2">I also thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40185" name="Bob Ainsworth">the Member for Coventry North East (Mr Ainsworth)</phrase>, the former Secretary of State for Defence, for his contribution. He had all of us listening. Bringing his knowledge to the debate was worth while. He managed to lay to rest some of the Aunt Sallies that are being held up with respect to new clause 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.6/3">I have heard people talk about the involvement of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase> with the Reserves. He has achieved something that very few of us have managed to do, even with our own Governments&#8212;he has brought forward and had accepted an amendment to a Government Bill, and I congratulate him on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.6/4">He will disagree with my remarks on new clause 3, but we all recognise that new clause 1 will be an improvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.6/5" class="italic">[Interruption.] </p>
	<p pid="b.1284.6/6">He has heard what my hon. Friends on the Front Bench have said about his previous voting record, but his conversion on this matter is welcome. The fact that the Government have accepted his new clause is a good thing and will improve the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.6/7">Let me explain to the House why we will support new clause 3 and the amendments tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron)</phrase>, why we have tabled some similar amendments, such as new clause 4, and why we have supported similar motions before. As the Secretary of State will realise from the tone of the debate, this House, including Her Majesty&#8217;s Opposition, will always put Britain&#8217;s security and national interest first. One of the first things I said when I was appointed shadow Defence Secretary was that when I thought the Government were doing the right thing on defence, I would work with them in a constructive and reasonable manner, and that is what the shadow Front-Bench team and I have done throughout the passage of this Bill. To be fair, the tone of the debate, notwithstanding the disagreements that exist between Members on both sides of the House, is one of reasonableness and constructiveness. We have been debating the best way forward with respect to these reforms and the proper defence of our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.6/8">I am sorry to have to say to the Secretary of State that he should not try to turn the debate into a party political row. It is disappointing and unnecessary. Contrary to what he said, we have raised this issue in parliamentary questions, in Committee and, as recently as last month, on the Floor of the House, when we passed a vote to approve a motion almost identical to the new clause. Importantly, the Secretary of State knows that we are not calling for the reforms to be reversed. He knows that we are not saying the reforms should be shelved. Like Members on both sides of the House, we want to see an enlarged Reserve force with an enhanced and more heavily integrated role alongside Regular forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1284.6/9">Let me once again praise and pledge my support, and that of the House, for our armed forces and the work they do. What we need is evidence that the reforms are progressing as planned and promised, and we are trying to get the Defence Secretary to take more responsibility for that. There is clearly an issue about viability. All signs coming from the MOD suggest that the plan has, to some extent, fallen off course. Members of the armed forces and of this House have justifiably and sincerely held concerns, and the Secretary of State has exacerbated those by his response to some of the concerns.</p>

	<p pid="b.1285.0/1">I recognise some of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s concerns, but does he not see that this is a long-term project? By accepting the substance of new clause 1, what we have put in place is a mechanism by which there will be an annual independent report, which will be laid before Parliament and which we fully expect to give rise to a debate. That will allow the progress of this programme to be tracked over many years. New clause 3 would create a one-off hurdle, which sends a negative signal now. That is not an equivalent provision.</p>

He should have a bit of confidence in them, because if they are working, Parliament will be keen to accept them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1286.2/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-07-16">16 July</phrase>, the Secretary of State told the House that</p>

	<p pid="b.1286.2/6">That was due last week. As we have since found out, that has not happened and will not happen until next year. Why? The UK Statistics Authority states that the Government&#8217;s figures are not robust enough so there must be some delay in their production.</p>
	<p pid="b.1286.2/7">We do know that the overall trained strength of the armed forces Reserve has fallen by 160 since last year and that time is slipping away, with the Secretary of State&#8217;s own 2018 target less than five years away. The last figures that were published showed that the Government were failing even to reach a quarter of the number of Reservists they said they needed to recruit to meet their own targets.</p>

	<p pid="b.1287.1/1">It all needs clarification, which is my point. It is interesting that when we have a debate such as this, when the Secretary of State is feeling under pressure, we see amendments being accepted and more information being brought before the House. It is good that he is saying how he will publish this and how he will respond to that, but we now know that some robustness is lacking from the Government&#8217;s figures.

	<p pid="b.1287.2/1">I thank the shadow Secretary of State for his generous words earlier, but I must pick him up on that last point.

	<p pid="b.1287.3/1">We think that the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendment, although it is welcome, does not go far enough. That is why we support new clause 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.3/2">When the Defence Secretary responds to the debate, I think the House would like to know a little more about what negotiations are going on with Capita, which is running the recruitment programme for the Defence Secretary. What are the problems? Will the IT issues be resolved soon? Are there any other issues? He will know that various rumours are circulating about the problems with regard to Capita and I think it would help the whole House to know where we are with those negotiations, what the Secretary of State intends to do about them and whether there are any penalty clauses for Capita should it continue not to perform as the Secretary of State and the House would expect.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.3/3">New clause 3 does not call for a reversal of the cuts to the Regular forces, despite some of the accusations from those on the Government Front Bench. We support it precisely because we want the Government to prove that their plans are both cost-effective and viable. For that reason, we deem it reasonable that both Houses of Parliament should scrutinise and approve a report that assesses the viability and cost-effectiveness of the reforms.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.3/4">It used to be the policy of this Government that Regular forces would only be reduced contingent on the required increase in reserve recruitment&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1287.7/1">The right hon. Gentleman is flying another kite. I am not making that commitment at all. We support the thrust of the reforms to the Regular</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.7/2">Army and the uplift in Reserves, but new clause 3 seeks to obtain a proper understanding of whether the reform is working, whether it is saving money, whether it is offering value for money and what is happening with the recruitment targets. We need much more clarity and openness about all those things. The Defence Secretary can say that these are spending pledges or things we do not know. He can attack the hon. Member for Basildon and Billericay for not properly understanding the reform. However, he needs to address what is being said rather than what he thinks we are saying, and that is the whole point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.7/3">We talk about allowing adequate uplift in the Reserves to meet the shortfall, and we heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the right hon. Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase>. He remarked only last month:</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.7/4">&#8220;When I was secretary of state, I said we would only decrease the numbers of regulars when we had guarantees that we would be able to get the numbers&#8212;training and equipping up of the reserves&#8212;to match.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.7/5">Members of the armed forces and of this House deserve to know from the Defence Secretary when that policy changed and why.</p>
	<p pid="b.1287.7/6">We support new clause 3 because we want the Defence Secretary to take more responsibility for these reforms. We consider it better to pause until the MOD has managed to get recruitment back on track as a plan accepted by Parliament than to be forced to ditch the entire reform a few years down the line when it is clear that it is not working. A pause before progressing the reforms would give him time to fix the problems, to provide us with the figures, to prove his plan is cost-effective and to show that he can meet the time frame he has set.</p>

We know about the withdrawal from Germany and that the Army will end operations in Afghanistan in 2014, but that does not alter the fact that we must understand that the downsizing of the Army and the Government&#8217;s stated policy mean that as the Regular numbers downsize and reduce an uplift in Reserve numbers should go alongside that. The central thrust of the whole debate is that we do not have confidence that the uplift in Reserves will be sufficient to conform to the policy on the reduction in the number of Regular forces. That is the central point.</p>

	<p pid="b.1289.7/3">If we do not get this right now, we are taking risks with our country&#8217;s defence and security, and that is not an option for Britain or our armed forces. I know that we all want to support the Government in getting this right; I, too, want to give the Defence Secretary the opportunity to get it right. That is why my right hon. and hon. Friends and I will support new clause 3&#8212;because it is in the best interests of our armed forces, and in the national interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.1290.0/1">I agree with everybody who has said that reservists have performed a singularly valuable task in recent operations&#8212;something like 25,000 have been deployed&#8212;whether by augmenting existing units or by contributing specialist skills that would not have been available to the regular armed forces. I remember very well visiting Basra with the Select Committee on Defence just a couple of months after the war ended, and finding that the entire Iraqi economy was being put right by an Army officer who, in civilian life, was a banker. He was responsible for putting Iraq&#8217;s finances in order. Clearly, he had more success than the previous Prime Minister had in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290.0/2">That brings me to the point made by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Select Committee, when he referred to the budget deficit. It is important that we all understand why we are here today and why we are debating these matters. We would not be here if Labour had not left this country with a catastrophic budget deficit of &#163;156 billion. That is why we had to make tough decisions&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1290.4/1">The hon. Gentleman had better wait to hear what I have to say. What I am about to say now is what I said when I was a Minister in the Ministry of Defence, which I would say more privately than I have been saying more recently. It is important that people recognise that in the Ministry of Defence we were faced, like every other Department bar those whose budgets were ring-fenced, with a requirement to produce savings immediately, because unless the Chancellor of the Exchequer was able to deliver a comprehensive spending review that reassured the capital markets that Britain was intent upon putting its public finances back in order, we would have been in an even worse position than we inherited in May 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290.4/2">I have much sympathy with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron)</phrase> and I can see where he is coming from: he wants a larger standing Army, and so do I. I am a Conservative. I believe that defence of the realm is the first duty of Government. I found it deeply distressing to be a Minister in a Ministry of Defence which was having to cut its budget, but we were in coalition. I see my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40431" name="Nick Harvey">the Member for North Devon (Sir Nick Harvey)</phrase>, who was an extremely collegiate colleague in the Ministry of Defence. I make no criticism of him; my criticism is of his leader. We had to make some pretty tough decisions, and ultimately it was not we in the Ministry of Defence who decided what our budget was. That was decided at No. 10 and in the National Security Council. That is what happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290.4/3">We are here today because we had to make some tough decisions. In other circumstances we would not have wished to have a standing Army reduced by 20,000 and a requirement to supplement it with another 30,000 reservists. The White Paper which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State produced earlier this year is littered with remarks about the financial constraints in which we have to operate, so it seems to me that we are making the best of a difficult situation. I hope, though, that the strategic defence review of 2015 will give us, particularly in the Conservative party, an opportunity to tell the nation that we intend to reorder the public spending priorities of the next Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290.4/4">I believe that in this uncertain and volatile world, an increase in defence expenditure is a must. We are not there yet, and I hope to make the case over the next couple of years that that is what we have to do. We must restore some of the capability gaps from which we are suffering, and we must seek to repair some of the damage that has inevitably been done by the cuts that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase> had to make. He and my right hon. Friend the present Secretary of State for Defence should be hugely congratulated on having sorted out the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s appalling finances, which they inherited from the previous Administration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290.4/5">The budget of the Ministry of Defence is now back on track, which is good news, but the strategic defence and security review of 2015 must give us an opportunity to enhance our niche capabilities, such as cyber, where my right hon. Friend has done an excellent job. I hope we can increase our investment in defence diplomacy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1290.4/6">I also believe that we need a larger standing Army. I must say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40105" name="Tobias Ellwood">the Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood)</phrase> that I am not sure that he can predict what kind of world we will find ourselves in when we draw down from Afghanistan. The past four years have taught me that predicting the future is pretty difficult. None of us could have foreseen the Arab spring, the conflict in Syria or what is going on in the South China sea as we speak. This is an unstable world. Ultimately, the niche capabilities are important, but being able to take and hold territory requires having boots on the ground.</p>

	<p pid="b.1292.3/1">My hon. Friend was absolutely right to mention my concern. I think that we have similar views on the desirable size of the armed forces, but I remind him that we had a vote on military intervention in Syria not long ago and this House decided fundamentally not to participate in that. I wonder how the House would vote on all the scenarios my hon. Friends have just mentioned. That will have a huge impact, and I worry about how this House is involved in that, but that is a concern on the size of the armed forces that we actually need.</p>

	<p pid="b.1292.4/1">If my hon. Friend thinks that Syria is a reliable or predictable template for the future, I urge him to be very cautious indeed, because it has special circumstances. I see no resiling by the Conservative part of this Administration from the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s statement to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in 2009 that a Conservative Government would seek to help shape the world in which we found ourselves and not simply to be shaped by it, and I entirely support that. I think that we need to have the means to back it up.</p>
	<p pid="b.1292.4/2">I will conclude by making this point: we are where we are. I have sought to set out why I believe we are where we are and what I believe we need to do for the future. I must say to my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and Billericay that the Chair of the Defence Committee, our right hon. Friend the Member for North East Hampshire, made a good point when he observed that the new clause would require the Government to put on hold the process of enacting the provisions for enhancing the reserves, and I know that he feels strongly about maintaining the number of regulars. The numbers of regulars are reducing, in accordance with the timetable set out two or three years ago. Therefore, the imperative is not to put the reserve generation on hold, but to ramp it up as fast as we can.</p>

I recommend that one or two Members actually look at the wording of the new clause. It is very simple. It basically proposes a pause while we examine whether rising costs will lead to false economies and whether we are opening up unacceptable capability gaps. The pause could be very short if the Government allowed prompt scrutiny of the report. It need only take a few weeks: the report could be produced immediately after the Bill gains Royal Assent and we could have a debate and vote in this House within weeks.</p>

	<p pid="b.1294.0/1">In direct answer to that question, if the plans do not bear scrutiny in this place, that tells us that we should not be doing it in the first place and suggests a much bigger story that the plans are not working.

	<p pid="b.1294.1/1">My hon. Friend is a gallant and, indeed, very honourable friend, but party politics do come into this from time to time. I cast no aspersions on the shadow Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40269" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase>, but it is a fact that, sometimes, if the Opposition see an opportunity to defeat the Government, they will use it. That is the way in which our system works, notwithstanding what the shadow Secretary of State has said about the general cross-party agreement on defence. Such agreement never existed when I first came to the House in 1983, so it is refreshing to debate matters in a much more intelligent way than in the mid-1980s.</p>
	<p pid="b.1294.1/2">I will conclude, because others wish to speak. We are not where I particularly would like to be, but the Army is to be commended for its professional approach. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury is also to be commended for the lead he has given. Our duty now is to crack on and make this work and, in the meantime, to address some of the longer-term structural issues as we approach the 2015 strategic defence review. I put my right hon. Friends on notice that I want the Conservative party to commit to giving more money to defence and it has to come out of the aid budget or any other budget&#8212;frankly, I do not care which. I think that the world is a dangerous place and we need our armed forces. The world has seen how professional they are. They are the finest armed forces in the world and they really can deliver what the Prime Minister wants, which is for this country to help shape the world in which we find ourselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.1294.2/2">It is worth reminding the Secretary of State and other right hon. and hon. Members that the British Army is of course Parliament&#8217;s Army; it is not the Crown&#8217;s Army. That dates back to the so-called Glorious Revolution, which is why we have to have an Armed Forces Act in every Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.1294.3/1">I am sorry to be a little outraged, but surely the hon. Gentleman would be the first to admit that it is not Parliament&#8217;s Army, but Her Majesty&#8217;s forces. It has nothing whatever to do with Parliament, although Parliament may deploy the forces on behalf of Her Majesty.</p>

	<p pid="b.1294.4/1">I have to disagree with the hon. Gentleman. Parliament must give permission for a standing Army in peacetime and, despite our actions in Afghanistan, we are in a time of peace. It is therefore specifically Parliament&#8217;s Army, not the Crown&#8217;s.</p>

	<p pid="b.1295.1/1">No, I will not. We hear quite enough from the hon. Gentleman at other times.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295.1/2">It is not the Royal Army: we have a Royal Navy and a Royal Air Force, but a British Army. I make that point not to take up valuable time, but because the Secretary of State seems to think that it is the job of Ministers of the Crown, not of Parliament, to make decisions about the Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295.1/3">In an earlier exchange about the Back-Bench debate, the Secretary of State said from a sedentary position that it was a Back-Bench vote. The problem with his approach, and the one advocated by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>, is that if there is an annual report that Members of Parliament want not only to debate but to vote on, it is clear that the Secretary of State&#8217;s intention would be to ignore any such decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295.1/4">This is our last chance to tell the Government that although the House supports the broad thrust of the Army reforms, they are clearly not going according to plan. The Secretary of State has already demonstrated that he has the courage to change tack, as he did on the aircraft carriers, when something is clearly going wrong. I am genuinely surprised that he is not prepared to say, &#8220;This is not going as well as we want. We need to slow the rate of progress, so that we do not end up in a disastrous position.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.1295.2/1">For a moment, I thought that the hon. Gentleman was suggesting that we ought to slow the rate of progress on the Reserves agenda, but if anything, we need to speed it up. I would just tell the hon. Gentleman&#8212;seeing the Chairman of the Defence Committee, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> in his place&#8212;that if he believes Ministers will not be regularly scrutinised from morning till night by the Select Committee and at Defence questions in this House throughout the implementation of the programme, I do not know what planet he is living on.

	<p pid="b.1295.3/1">If the Secretary of State had been paying a bit more attention, he would have heard me say that it is quite clear that he does not intend to respect any such vote in Parliament.

	<p pid="b.1295.5/1">I am grateful for that intervention. I hope that it would not be a career-damaging move if I called <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> my hon. Friend, because I have had the pleasure of serving with him on the Defence Committee for the past</p>
	<p pid="b.1295.5/2">three years. That is a perfectly reasonable suggestion and I am sorry that the Secretary of State has not offered that option.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295.5/3">There is genuine good will on both sides of the House. The armed forces and the defence of the realm are not issues that should be party political. This has been a good debate so far because we have managed, on the whole, to keep party politics out of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295.5/4">I agree with the Chairman of the Defence Committee about the growing value of cyber-warfare. When the Defence Committee visited the United States earlier this year, we went to cyber command and saw at first hand the key role that is being played by Reservists. I think that Members on both sides of the House would agree that we need more Reservist like those coming through.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295.5/5">The problem is that the bald facts show that we are not recruiting sufficient reservists. When the generals appeared before the Defence Committee earlier this year, they said that we needed to recruit 6,000 Reservists annually. I am sure that the Secretary of State has the most up-to-date figures, but I doubt whether a huge number of Reservists have been recruited in the past few days. We are clearly falling short and we have been falling short for years. This is not just a teething problem; it is an ongoing problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295.5/6">As the Chief of the General Staff has said, there is no plan B on this project. It is therefore crucial that we get it right. At the moment&#8212;I say this in a genuinely bipartisan manner&#8212;the Government are not on track to meet these important targets. It is entirely sensible for the House to ask for a pause so that the Government can get back on track. The excellent observation was made earlier that that would help to focus minds. Having robust targets and the threat of a pause hanging over the Ministry of Defence might get it to pull the finger out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1295.5/7">The point on which I disagree gently with the hon. Member for Canterbury is that the problem until now has been that the Regular generals have been siphoning off the money. They have not made enough progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.1297.3/1">On new clause 6, we have all heard, in the Defence Committee and elsewhere, that the biggest disincentive to joining the Reserves, of whichever service, is getting time off work.

Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt)</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="b.1297.3/2">&#8220;a lot of reservists find it difficult to get time off for deployment or training courses&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2013-04-23.273"><i>Official Report, </i>23 April 2013; Vol. 561, c. 273WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1297.3/3">I am sorry that she is not in her place today. Perhaps she is training. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> She is away on a course and we wish her all the best. Even the Secretary of State&#8217;s PPS has acknowledged that this is a huge challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297.3/4">The White Paper sets out an ambitious goal of increasing the annual training requirement to 40 days, and I think Members on all sides of the House recognise the importance of that. I hope the Secretary of State will support new clause 6&#8212;his Liberal Democrat colleagues will, for reasons I will explain in a moment&#8212;because it seeks to provide a simple way to address that goal: Reservists</p>
	<p pid="b.1297.3/5">would receive an additional two weeks unpaid leave from their employer, provided that their firms had more than 50 employees. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40457" name="Brian Binley">The hon. Member for Northampton South (Mr Binley)</phrase> made the point that we have to careful about the impact on small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is right that we provide protection to smaller companies. The proposal is sensible and measured, because Reservists will receive their military pay at no cost to their employer. In the rare cases of resistance from an employer, we propose that complaints are referred to an employment tribunal for arbitration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1297.3/6">I must confess that I am confident that the Liberal Democrats will vote for new clause 6 because the idea was originally developed by them and was passed at their party conference only seven weeks ago. I suspect that the former Minister for the Armed Forces, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40431" name="Nick Harvey">the hon.

I confirm my party&#8217;s support for the idea of two weeks&#8217; military training and, although I do not purport to speak for them, I am sure many Conservative Members take the same view. The difficulty with legislating for that now in the manner the hon. Gentleman is suggesting is that there is a serious cost implication: he is proposing that military pay will be provided for that period of time. I dearly hope that this Government or a future Government will at some point be able to find the resources, but a gargantuan effort has been made to balance the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s books and the resources are not there. I know the Labour party has a bit of form on making unfunded commitments, but it would be irresponsible to legislate on this when we do not have the funds to pay for it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1298.1/1">I am genuinely baffled. I do not know where the hon. Gentleman was before he came into the Chamber, but Reservists already receive pay when they are on training. This proposal is not about additional training time; it is about meeting requirements for the training they have to undertake. If his only concern is about the funding element, I can reassure him that there is no additional spending cost. It actually&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> If the hon. Gentleman stops chuntering for one second, I will finish. There will be no cost to the business and no additional cost to the Ministry of Defence, because it is already providing pay for that training period. Having given him that reassurance, I look forward to his confirming that Liberal Democrats will support us in the Lobby, in the unfortunate event that we cannot just adopt the proposal as a whole and someone calls a vote.</p>

It is up to us to send a clear signal that we want to support our armed forces, whether they be Regular or Reserves, on land, on sea or in the air. It is crucial that we provide a robust target for the MOD to do what it should be doing and ensuring that we have an adequate number of Regulars and Reserves to meet the aspirations that we all have for them.</p>

	<p pid="b.1299.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40217" name="Thomas Docherty">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Thomas Docherty)</phrase>. Many of his remarks I agree with; some I disagree with. However, I particularly admire my close and hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>&#8212;who sadly has gone for a cup of tea&#8212;and my other close and hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron)</phrase>. They have opposing views, but they both have the good of the nation and the armed forces at their heart. I have no doubt about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299.0/2">I think I am right in saying that of all the ex-Regulars and ex-Territorials in the House, I am the only one who has been a professional recruiter. My last job in the Army was as a colonel in the Army training and recruiting agency. I use the word &#8220;agency&#8221; with a curl of the lip: it was not a command or a military formation of any sort, which was one of the reasons why I resigned from the Army&#8212;because of its disgraceful conduct, particularly over recruiting. I will return to that in a moment. I also had the privilege to belong to and to command a battalion that, at the height of the Territorial Army, had to find permanent staff instructors, adjutants and the like for up to four Territorial battalions&#8212;our third and fourth battalions, and what were then called the 1st and 2nd Battalions the Mercian Regiment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299.0/3">That is where I first heard about STABs, which stands for stupid TA&#8212;and then a word that means &#8220;illegitimate people&#8221;&#8212;and about arrogant Regular Army &#8220;illegitimate people&#8221;. That is an example of the desperate confusion and rivalry between Regulars and Territorials, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury made such clear reference, from the first and second world wars, and so on. I am a little out of date now, but in my experience that was a deeply divisive and extremely unhelpful view. In the Regular Army, we had to provide a lot of those individuals, which absolutely was a nuisance. None the less, anybody who looked at the colours of my regiment&#8212;or, indeed, of the fusiliers or any of the infantry or cavalry regiments in the British Army&#8212;would have seen that the majority of the battle honours on those colours were won by battalions and regiments from the Territorial Force or the Territorial Army. It is a fact; we cannot get away from it. Any Regular Army individual who ignores the importance, the potential or the sheer enthusiasm of the Reserves&#8212;the TF, the TA or whatever we want to call them&#8212;is simply daft.</p>
	<p pid="b.1299.0/4">However, there are reservations I would like to express about the future of warfare and the type of forces we need to fight those wars. Turning to new clause 1, my experience as a commanding officer is that I was told in the late &#8217;90s that my battalion was about 40 men under strength and that we could not recruit more than that, which, in a recruiting famine, would be quite impossible. I talked closely to what was then called the recruiting group of the Army training and recruiting agency, listened to its advice and did precisely the opposite.</p>

	<p pid="b.1300.1/1">I entirely agree, in which case, in my 25-year experience, that is completely wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.1300.1/2">Moving swiftly on. The Army and training recruiting agency, as it was at the time, could not and would not recruit. We were 40 men under strength when I took command; inside a year, we were 120 men over strength&#8212;in a recruiting famine when the economy was apparently buoyant and there were difficulties in finding manpower. What was going wrong with recruiting in the late &#8217;90s is going wrong with recruiting today. I dread to hear people talking about recruiting offices not being open at the weekends; I dread to hear that people are not being recruited especially for the Territorial and the Reserve forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1300.1/3">In my experience the only way to produce a battalion with an extra company was by fully understanding where to recruit and how to recruit, and by using our own resources. When we realised that recruitment was not particularly for the TA, we took TA recruiters with us, ensured that the particular conditions of the Reserve forces and the Territorial Army were understood and sent those recruits straight to the TA rather than try to confuse them with the Regular Army. I make no pretence of fully understanding the impact of social media, on which Capita and other firms base the core of their recruiting effort&#8212;that was different in my day&#8212;but I do know that unless we get out with capable and experienced people, seek recruits in the places where they are most plentiful, and physically present the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and the Reserve forces, we will not recruit people. We simply will not, and I would be happy to debate that with anyone who thinks it is incorrect.</p>
	<p pid="b.1300.1/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and Billericay tells me that TA numbers are falling, while the Secretary of State for Defence seems to disagree. I am not quite sure, but there seems to be a serious divergence between the two. I would respectfully say that the Secretary of State has mentioned in the past that applications for the Reserve forces were going up. On the basis of my experience, however, I would say that applications are very different from enlistments and that the problem is even worse in the Reserve forces than it is inside the Regular Army.</p>

	<p pid="b.1301.4/1">There we are: we see the opposing views of the two sides. All I ask is for the Secretary of State for Defence to be clear about it, and to continue to be clear about it. I find new clause 1 to be sensible; it has my complete support. New clause 3 posits some extremely interesting questions, and we have had a good debate about it this evening. However, I think that the point about the changing face of warfare is terribly important.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301.4/2">We have heard a lot of talk about cyber-warfare and other specialist forms of warfare. If we open our history books, we see that in the late 1920s there was a school of thought which held that the fighting of savage tribes could be done entirely from the air. That was tried by an emergent Royal Air Force in Wazirista, and it completely failed, because there were not the boots on the ground to support the Royal Air Force in the excellent work that it did.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301.4/3">Of course there are specialisations within the Reserve forces and the Territorial Army which are desperately important, but what our Regular forces depend on is a very high level of fitness, a very high level of training, and an ability to deploy instantly. One of my hon. Friends, who is no longer in the Chamber, observed that there was always a period of time before any Reservist&#8212;any Territorial&#8212;was up to snuff. That is no criticism, but, as Members who have served in infantry battalions know, preparing an individual for combat is akin to training a professional athlete. The level of fitness is extraordinarily important. I challenge any civilian holding down a full-time civilian job&#8212;and I do not say this with any form of disrespect&#8212;to be at such a level of fitness for instant deployment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1301.4/4">What we want for the future is the ability to nip problems in the bud&#8212;to avoid confrontation and conflict&#8212;and we therefore require deployment that is instantaneous, or as near to that as we can make it. I must say, with the greatest respect, that no Reservist can achieve that. It is not in the nature of Reserve forces. The clue is in the phrase &#8220;Reserve, not Regular&#8221;. I say that with profound respect for all Territorials and all Reservists, and for their naval and air force equivalents.</p>

	<p pid="b.1301.5/1">I broadly accept what my hon. Friend has said about fitness, but does he not accept that a significant number of Territorial Army regiments are absolutely ready for deployment in the way that he has described? I am thinking particularly of my own regiment, the</p>
	<p pid="b.1301.5/2">Honourable Artillery Company, but I am also thinking of the TA special forces regiments, which are as good as their Regular counterparts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1302.0/1">I accept that a very small number of Territorials are ready for instant deployment, but I have to say that the Territorial Army units that I have seen&#8212;none of which have been so-called special forces, and which I shall not name&#8212;have been a very, very long way from being ready for instant deployment. That is just my experience, but I fear that the Territorials who came to support me on operations were never up to snuff until we had given them concerted and extensive periods of training, including fitness training.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302.0/2">I think that if we wish to avoid trouble, it is quite wrong for us to reduce the size of our Regular forces until our Territorial or Reserve forces are fully in place, fully equipped, and fully trained to deploy. I understand that the standards are different, and I respect the fact that Reservists need a period of training before they can deploy, but I think it irresponsible to allow our Regular forces, with their instant deployment capability, to be run down before we have an adequate replacement.</p>

	<p pid="b.1302.1/1">It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40417" name="Patrick Mercer">the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase>, and, indeed, rather daunting to follow so many right hon. and hon. Friends&#8212;some of them gallant&#8212;who have so much personal and very relevant experience and knowledge of this subject. My special interest is the relationship between the armed forces and employers, and I believe that the Bill presents an opportunity in that context.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302.1/2">With a more integrated role for Reserves will come a more open and supportive relationship between armed forces and employers. A number of the new clauses refer to business, implicitly or explicitly, and would have an impact on it. That is why I was so keen to speak at this point. As a small business owner and as someone who has been in business for more than 20 years and has employed Reservists, I understand that, for many of them, successful service in the military depends hugely on the support of their employers. That will become even more important given the increased role of Reservists in the future armed forces, and it is right for us to recognise the valuable contributions that employers make to our national security by hiring them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302.1/3">Equally, however, it is important that trained-up Reservists are provided with accredited qualifications that the armed forces can provide, and these will give a real service to employers. We must recognise the skills employees will gain from Reserve service and how that will benefit employers and society as a whole. Ultimately business needs one thing more than anything else: certainty. It just wants to know what is expected of it with sufficient notice and what it can expect in return. I am delighted that this Bill commits to providing employers with full information about what hiring a Reservist entails.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302.1/4">Too many businesses currently have no experience of hiring a Reservist and the establishment of a national relationship management scheme will strengthen the partnership between the armed forces and employer organisations, leading to a much more open and predictable relationship in which all parties are fully aware of what is required of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302.1/5">One of my concerns with new clause 3 is that it will provoke confusion. It will delay or prevent payments being made to small enterprises when their employees are mobilised. This extra finance for small and medium-sized enterprises, who find it most difficult to plug the gap when their employees are away, is vital. These firms do us a great service by employing Reservists and it is only right that they should be fully compensated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302.1/6">My other concern with new clause 3 is about the delay in the delivery of the transferable skills. This Bill does not just compensate firms; it provides them with real benefits for deciding to hire a member of the new Army Reserve. Time with the Reserves can greatly enhance an employee&#8217;s effectiveness through high-quality training, leading opportunities and the chance to gain specific civilian-recognised qualifications while on duty. By accrediting Reservists with recognised qualifications, we not only help them progress their careers, but provide real incentives for employers to take them on in the first place. Businesses will know that while their employees are away on duty they will not be engaged in unnecessary training exercises, but will be gaining tangible and valuable skills. This will also encourage more people to consider serving with the Reserves. The fact that they will be able to make a genuine contribution to our national security while increasing their employability in their chosen career path will be a real pull, attracting high-quality individuals into the Army Reserve.</p>
	<p pid="b.1302.1/7">This will help more than just those who are currently employed, however. Reserve service can help provide people who are currently out of work with boosts to both their skills and their self-confidence, helping them on to the job ladder. Joint industry-led apprenticeships will provide unemployed young people with a trade and accredited qualifications, but, more than that, Reservists will learn how to work as part of a team, how to solve problems and how to present themselves with maturity. These skills are harder to define than others, but are no less valuable</p>
	<p pid="b.1302.1/8">Time with the Army Reserves is a great preparation for life in the workplace, enhancing employability skills and boosting self-confidence. It is excellent news that this Government will be placing clear emphasis on the development of Reservists, and on building and maintaining an open and productive relationship between employers and the armed forces. We owe a great debt both to the individuals who protect our national security and to the businesses that employ our Reserve troops. I am delighted that this Bill will make sure that we are repaying both those employers and the Reservists themselves by providing them with the training and skills to flourish both in the field and in the workplace.</p>

	<p pid="b.1303.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40281" name="Caroline Dinenage">the Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage)</phrase> both because I very much agree with her point about small and medium-sized enterprises and the Territorial Army and because it gives me an opportunity to thank her publicly for the superb work she has done as chairman of the royal naval section of the all-party group on the armed forces for the last three years. She has graced the position&#8212;both physically and intellectually, if I may say so&#8212;over that time and I am most grateful to her for it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1303.0/2">I did not intend to contribute to the debate, but I rise to speak briefly because I find myself in a difficult position. That difficulty has been highlighted by much of what has been said in the debate and in the media</p>
	<p pid="b.1303.0/3">over the last 36 hours or so, and it is that, contrary as this may sound to our experience personally, most people observing, and taking part in, the debate are of the same, or at least a very similar, view. We all deeply regret the reduction in the Army from 102,000 to 82,000 soldiers. It is appalling; personally, I think it is disgraceful. I am extraordinarily concerned about the future of the globe if we have an Army of 82,000 soldiers and about the reductions in the RAF and Royal Navy. One or two of my colleagues have expressed that concern very well. This is a very uncertain world, and facing it with this reduced defence spending is extremely worrying. As a Back Bencher, I have no personal responsibility for these matters, but I accept that the financial position in which the Government found themselves when they came to power three years ago necessitated these cuts in defence spending, in the same way as they necessitated all kinds of unpleasant cuts in other Departments. None the less, I deeply regret them and am extraordinarily worried about them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1303.0/4">I also have great reservations about the Army 2020 plan for the Territorial Army. I am a passionate supporter of the TA and Reserve forces. I served in the TA for seven years, and I think the work of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase> in forcing forward this agenda has been superb. Contrary to what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40417" name="Patrick Mercer">the Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase> said, I think that in the future the Reserve forces will make a magnificent contribution to whatever we ask our armed services to do, as they have done in both Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>

	<p pid="b.1304.0/1">I commend my hon. Friend for all his good work on behalf of the Regular armed forces in this place, but with the greatest of respect his point that the MOD budget has to be cut because of the financial constraints does not quite ring true because other Departments have escaped the cuts. It is a question of national priorities. Does he agree?</p>

	<p pid="b.1304.1/1">I always feel instinctively uneasy when anyone says, &#8220;With the greatest of respect,&#8221; because it almost certainly means, &#8220;With no respect at all.&#8221; Of course, I agree with my hon. Friend: of course, we would all love the budgets to be as they were; of course, many of us would like the aid or other budgets cut, possibly in favour of defence; of course, those of us who believe passionately in defence would like to see the defence of the realm maintained as it has been for the past many years; of course, we would like us to achieve the NATO target of spending 2% of GDP&#8212;or even the NATO target of spending 2.5%&#8212;of GDP on defence, but this is realpolitik and those things are not going to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1304.1/2">I will leave that to one side for a moment. We all start from the position of regretting the cuts but realising the reasons for them. On the Reserve forces, we all hope the plans in place work. We are all committed to making them work and believe that the Reserve forces have done a superb job. In recent years, and as long ago as the first world war, they have made a gigantic contribution to the defence of the realm, and we strongly support that. Everyone in the Chamber is deeply concerned about whether the 20,000 Regular soldiers will be replaced by the increase in the TA that is posited. Of course, we</p>
	<p pid="b.1304.1/3">are concerned about that, about the recruitment figures and about whether the Secretary of State&#8217;s plans will work out. Those are common positions. I suspect that not one person in the Chamber would disagree.</p>
	<p pid="b.1304.1/4">The disagreement arises when we consider what to do about it. The Regular Army is already at about 86,000 or 87,000. By early February, it will be at about 82,760. The redundancy notices have gone out. People are already on their leaving training and getting ready to leave the Regular forces. We cannot reverse that. No matter what we do in the Chamber today, there is no magic wand that will reverse it. By the middle of January, the Army will be at 82,760 soldiers. Regret it as we may, we cannot reverse that. The second thing for certain is that, whether or not we have confidence it will work, we will have to set about increasing the size of the Reserve forces, their training and their equipment so that they can replace the lost Regulars. Those two things are certainties, and regret them as we may, they are going to occur.</p>
	<p pid="b.1304.1/5">The question, therefore, is: what do we do about it? That is the nature of this debate, and it seems to me that there are two possibilities. The first thing we could do, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron)</phrase> seeks to do&#8212;I have to admit that I signed his new clause 3&#8212;is to write our aims and concerns into legislation. In recent years we have done that in this House on a number of occasions&#8212;for example, with regard to the green carbon targets and reducing child poverty. In such cases, there is a law that says, &#8220;The Government will do this or do that,&#8221; and if it does not achieve those aims there will be some penalty to pay. It is therefore perfectly possible that we could do what my hon. Friend seeks to do by writing into legislation&#8212;the law of the land&#8212;something that says that the Government will improve our Reserve forces in the way described. The alternative approach would be to do what we do with regard to every single thing in this place&#8212;to scrutinise what the Government are doing in questions and debates in this Chamber, in Westminster Hall and in Select Committees. We can do that in a variety of ways.</p>
	<p pid="b.1304.1/6">I am very encouraged by the fact that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State tells me that because of my hon. Friend&#8217;s new clause and this debate, he, the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Defence as a whole have been entirely focused on this matter for a number of days. That means we have achieved one of the things we wanted to achieve. We have said to the nation as a whole&#8212;it has been wall to wall in the media&#8212;that we are deeply concerned about these cuts in defence spending, about the fact that we have an Army of 82,000 that may not be able to do its job, and about whether the re-growing of the Territorial Army will actually occur. However, should we take the further step of writing those concerns into legislation?</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>, I suggest that one way of helping to get everyone onside would be to have a report on the state of the Reserves produced quickly, before the Bill comes back to this House. My hon. Friend thinks, unless he shakes his head to indicate the contrary, that the people to do it would be members of the Reserve Forces and Cadets Association. That could take the sting out of the tail very quickly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1306.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. There is an absolute requirement on the Government to come before this House and report on what they are doing about this, and I have every confidence that they will, whether through the all-party group on the Reserve forces and Cadets, chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, the Defence Committee, Opposition days that the Opposition will no doubt call, Back-Bench business days or regular oral questions. I am confident that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will be at the Dispatch Box day in, day out for the next two or three years answering difficult questions about recruiting in the Territorial Army. I pledge to him now that I will be his most difficult inquisitor. If he thinks that he is somehow going to get off the hook and that I am going to become a nice fellow and be gentle with him, he is completely wrong. I spent an hour in his study yesterday afternoon explaining these matters to him.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.0/2">The question is whether it is right that our concerns about cuts in the regular Army and our aspirations about improvements in the Territorial Army should be written into legislation. Having listened to the debate, I am sorry to have to advise my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and Billericay&#8212;if he were listening he would no doubt shake his head in disappointment&#8212;that I am increasingly convinced that it is not right to seek to write these things into legislation because they are political rather than legislative matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.0/3">Two things greatly concern me about new clause 3, despite the fact that my name appears on it. First, it would have no effect whatsoever on the reductions in the Regular forces that we are mainly concerned about. Secondly, if we had a pause to examine the matter and produce a report, one of two things would happen at the end of that pause. The report would be satisfactory to the House of Commons and the House of Lords, we would vote for it, and the plans would plough ahead as they were before, or the report would not be satisfactory to us and we would turn it down. If the latter were to occur, who knows what would happen? Presumably we would have to start again. The one thing that would not happen, even then, would be that somehow we magically grew the Regular forces to fill the gap that had by then appeared. If I am right in thinking that the House would approve the report, what on earth is the point of a huge gap between now and then in producing it? We would end up with precisely the same plans that we have for the growth and retraining of the Territorial Army that we have at the moment. I am not convinced that the pause that the new clause would write into legislation would necessarily help the situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1306.0/4">We are all deeply concerned about what is happening, and I very much hope that we will not be back in the Chamber in five or 10 years expressing our regret about it, although I have a horrible feeling that we might be. However, I am by no means convinced that the new clause is the solution to our concerns. I pledge to give my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench as hard a time as I possibly can&#8212;probably even a harder time than I gave the Government when we were in opposition&#8212;in the Select Committee and in this Chamber, but I am not convinced that writing these concerns into legislation is the right thing to do. I therefore have to disappoint my hon. Friend and tell him that, despite having put my name to his new clause, I shall be unable to support him in the Lobby.</p>

	<p pid="b.1307.0/1">It is a pleasure to be able to say that, unlike the traveller who fell among thieves, I feel like one who has fallen among friends. On these issues, I have friends on both sides of the House, including, first and foremost, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>, who has been a wonderful advocate for the Reserve forces for many years. I say to him and to those on the Front Bench that if this matter had simply been put forward in isolation, I would not have contemplated voting for the new clause tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron)</phrase>. I am thinking of doing that for two reasons but, before I go into detail, I shall mention a couple more of my friends.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.0/2">It is a pleasure to welcome to the Opposition Front Bench another friend, the new shadow Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40269" name="Vernon Coaker">the hon. Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase>. My experience of his activities and positions on security issues has been wholly positive, and he has lived up to that by making his first trip as shadow Secretary of State a visit to the Barrow shipyards. I am sure that we can rely on him to maintain the firm position in support of the successor generation of submarines for the nuclear deterrent that both Front Benches adhere to, and which only one small party has sought to obstruct.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.0/3">Another friend to whom I would like to refer&#8212;he has just slipped out of the Chamber for a moment&#8212;is the Secretary of State for Defence, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40512" name="Philip Hammond">the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Mr Hammond)</phrase>. Most people would agree that he was a very fine Treasury Minister indeed. I cannot think of anyone who was better at tackling complex financial problems and explaining them in terms so crystal clear that, from time to time, I even thought that I understood them myself. In reality, I could not think of any person, when presented with a limited budget&#8212;whether for defence or any other portfolio&#8212;who would make a better fist than my right hon. Friend of adjusting the workings of the Department concerned to fit a budget that he had perhaps rather arbitrarily been allocated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.0/4">That has a direct bearing on the two reasons for my putting my name down in support of my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and Billericay&#8217;s new clause and amendments. The first relates to the size of the defence budget; the second is the question of whether the scheme for the Reserves is or was linked to the proposed reduction in the size of the Army. Those are the two things that worry me. Even if my hon. Friend&#8217;s new clause and amendments are not ideally drafted&#8212;I am not saying that they are not&#8212;they present me, and other hon. Members whose main purpose of being in Parliament, apart from representing our constituents, is to maximise the defence of this country against threats, with one of the few opportunities that we have to register our concerns when we think that defence has fallen too far down the list of priorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.0/5">I listened carefully to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40455" name="James Gray">the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray)</phrase> saying that the defence budget was a given. I am afraid that I do not accept that. I do not accept that more money could not have been found from within the defence budget and outside it. There could have been more money. We did not need to spend &#163;1.4 billion extending the life of four Vanguard-class submarines just to satisfy the Liberal Democrats, so they could put off the decision to sign the main-gate</p>
	<p pid="b.1307.0/6">contracts for the successor submarines until the next Parliament. We did not need to spend a whole shedload of money reversing the plan for two aircraft carriers and to adopt a preposterous plan for one functional and one non-functional aircraft carrier, and then spend another shedload of money reverting to the original position. Nor do we need to spend &#163;40 billion or &#163;50 billion on a high-speed train service to the north of England&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1308.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Having missed some of the recent debate, I am unclear as to which clause we are precisely discussing&#8212;and I really cannot tell from the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s speech.</p>

	<p pid="b.1308.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman had not been absent, he would have heard the great deal of discussion that took place about the priority of defence in the nation&#8217;s schedule of priorities. If he had made that bogus, so-called point of order having been here, I would have had some time for him, but given that he did not even have the courtesy to listen to the debate before making it, it was unworthy.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308.2/2">The reality is that a nation gets the defence forces it is prepared to pay for and it can decide what level of services it will fund&#8212;whether that involves cuts in the Army, the Royal Navy or the Royal Air Force that could be avoided.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308.2/3">The next question is whether this scheme for the Reserves was linked to the proposed cut in the size of the Army. As I said, if this scheme had been put forward on its own, I could have wholeheartedly supported it, but it was not. It was specifically put forward as a compensating factor for the Army&#8217;s Regular strength being reduced by 20,000. We were told that that reduction would be compensated for by the 30,000 increase in Reserves. Now we are told that that linkage no longer exists. My hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire asked what we will do if we find that in fact the Reserve scheme is not working. If I understood him correctly&#8212;I think I did&#8212;he said that, by the time we discovered that we were not going to get the 30,000 Reservists, it would be too late to regenerate any of the loss in the 20,000 Regulars. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> He seems to be indicating that I have understood him correctly. If that is the case, I take great exception to the fact that this linkage was ever made in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1308.2/4">If we are to be told that we have to accept cuts in this country&#8217;s defence capability, we should be told that honestly. We should not constantly be confronted with shifting goalposts. If the recruitment of 30,000 Reservists may or may not be achieved, and if the 20,000 cut in Regulars will happen nevertheless and is irreversible, we should have been told that at the outset. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Somebody says, &#8220;We were.&#8221; Who said that?</p>

	<p pid="b.1308.3/1">Allow me to be the person who says that we were indeed told that. I very much regret that that has occurred. None the less, my point is not that I endorse this, but that it has happened: by <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-10">10 January</phrase>, the British Army will be 82,767. That is the case and cannot be reversed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-20b.1309.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40415" speakername="Julian Lewis" colnum="1309"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#131120-0003.htm_spnew62">
	<p pid="b.1309.0/1">Yes, but if so, that was always going to be the case, and we should not have been sold the package of a cut in Regular numbers of 20,000 on the basis that at least we could look forward to 30,000 Reservists being added. That is no way to treat a mature Parliament or to show respect for the judgment of parliamentarians who are doing their best to supply the best level of defence that we can within the budget available.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309.0/2">A very simple principle is at stake here. Let us suppose that someone comes to a sovereign Parliament and says, &#8220;We are going to make a significant cut in the size of the Army, but don&#8217;t worry about it because we are going to compensate for it by building up the Reserves to the tune of 30,000 people.&#8221; If there are any significant or reasonable doubts at all about whether the 30,000 target will be achieved, it is reasonable to say, &#8220;Hang on a minute, what happens if the 30,000 is not achieved?&#8221; If the answer is that the 20,000 cuts will take place in any case, it is absolutely unacceptable to have promised the 30,000 in the first place, especially as it was explicitly stated to the House that the cuts in the Regulars would not be fully or irreversibly implemented until we knew that the Reserves were going to be forthcoming. I do not want us to have this debate again in a few months&#8217; time or in a few years&#8217; time over the fact that we have neither the number of Regulars we need nor the number of extra Reserves that were promised. That is why, whatever the intricacies of the wording of new clause 3, I intend to support it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-20b.1309.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" speakername="Rory Stewart" colnum="1309"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#131120-0003.htm_spnew63">
	<p pid="b.1309.1/1">I wish to speak briefly, because I am aware that many others wish to contribute, in strong defence of new clause 1 and against new clause 3. Both relate to the central issue, which has been raised by almost everyone in this debate: recruitment into the Territorial Army. New clause 1 will encourage recruitment, because it will show that we are taking the Reserves seriously, whereas new clause 3 will discourage recruitment by introducing an unnecessary delay. The most important thing, which lies behind this entire debate, is defining what the Reserves are for&#8212;what the function of the military is about. The best way to guarantee that we have a well-supported, well-recruited Reserve is if we in this House can agree what the future shape of the Army is supposed to be and what we are supposed to be doing with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309.1/2">The central issue, which perhaps has not been touched on enough today and which I would like to touch on briefly, is whether we have or have not learned the lessons of the past 10 years. Do we have the shape of Reserves or of the Regular Army required to meet the threats of the future? In essence, events of the past 10 years have completely exploded, or should have done in this Chamber, the entire consensus on nation building and counter-insurgency. For 10 years, the entire shape of our military has been arranged around those two principles, both of which I suggest, modestly, have been discredited. The experience of Iraq and Afghanistan should have taught us by now that we have designed the wrong kind of Army for the wrong kind of campaign. Those two central slogans, &#8220;nation building&#8221; and &#8220;counter-insurgency&#8221;, have not worked. We do not have time to talk through why they have not worked&#8212;if we had a long debate, we could do so&#8212;but we have to design reserve forces that meet that problem and that challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309.1/3">Why has nation building not worked? In essence, it was because it was an over-ambitious fantasy. The jargon of &#8220;the rule of law&#8221;, &#8220;governance&#8221; and &#8220;civil society&#8221; turned out to be impossible to deliver. We never had the tour lengths, the linguistic knowledge or the deep area expertise to deliver things that require an understanding of culture and history. Counter-insurgency did not work for even deeper reasons, which the military predicted&#8212;in the United States and the United Kingdom&#8212;before we deployed. We never had the requisite number of troops, nor were we ever likely to. We never had the tour lengths we required. We never had a credible, effective, legitimate Government in Baghdad or Kabul to back us. We never had full control of the borders. In the absence of such structures, those missions turned out to be impossible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309.1/4">Unless the Reserves and the Regular Army take on those lessons, we will have the wrong kind of forces in the future. That does not mean that our military does not have a deep function in intervention, but that deep function needs to look at the model of Bosnia, and not that of Iraq or Afghanistan. We need to remember that in Bosnia, our military proved exactly what an intervention can do. It went into a country with 110,000 people under arms. It went into a country when a million refugees had been displaced and when there were internal borders dividing it up in 25 different ways. By the time we had finished that intervention, the internal borders had gone, the militia had been reduced to 5,000 and the crime rate in Bosnia had dropped; it is now lower than that of Sweden. That is the kind of success for which we should be preparing our military.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309.1/5">The final thing&#8212;this really goes to the heart of what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase> has raised&#8212;is the question of how the knowledge, the imagination and the skills and the local links of the Reserves should be adjusted to a new world. There are small ingredients that we should insert, and I plead with the Secretary of State to please look very hard at reintroducing the short-service limited commission, or the gap-year commission. My hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, I and a number of other Members of Parliament are proud to claim that we have been in the military. Our standing there was very brief, but it was an incredibly deep and important experience for us and for many other people. It is a relatively cheap programme, and it is one that can develop the links between the military and the local population.</p>
	<p pid="b.1309.1/6">On imagination and skills, the biggest prize for which we should be aiming is to fill in the gap that the Foreign Office, the Department for International Development and the current military are unable to fill in. I am talking about deep area expertise and deep linguistic expertise, which the right kind of reserve forces should be able to produce. We need to recruit, promote and incentivise the right kind of people. We want people with other lives, other jobs and other experiences, who should be able to develop what we have been sadly lacking for 20 years, which is a sensitivity to other cultures and an understanding of other environments, other local business and other political structures. If we can get those things right, we have exactly what we need for new clause 1, which is a template, a model or a bar to which to hold the Government accountable on how the reserve forces should function. We will also have a reason not to proceed with new clause 3, which delays the most important part of rebuilding the Reserves.</p>

We need a plan, a direction and a confidence of Government, and that will turn around recruitment. People do not join the Reserves for exactly how many days they serve, for how much money they receive or for the pension terms they get. They join because they feel that it matters. Government are serious about them, Parliament is serious about them and we know where we are going. The reason why I will not vote for new clause 3 is that it passes exactly the wrong model at exactly the time when we should be moving forward with the wonderful work of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury and producing the excitement and the vision that we require. Another muddle and another conversation would be catastrophic.</p>

Indeed, I went to see the Secretary of State yesterday to lobby for new clause 1 and I am delighted to see that it has been accepted by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.4/3">New clause 1 is important because, in spite of the praise we have heard for the reserve forces and specifically for the TA from Members on both sides of the House, all Territorials will say that a certain amount of antipathy exists between regular and reserve forces as they serve our country together. It is absolutely right that the new clause should put into law independent scrutiny and independent control over what is happening to our reserve forces and the reserve forces estate, as well as the progress in recruitment and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.4/4">The Government had to take very difficult decisions, and they decided to move towards a Regular Army of 82,000 and an Army Reserve, as we will soon call it, of 30,000, making a total Army strength of 112,000. Incidentally, we would still have the fourth largest defence budget in the world and a considerable list of new equipment to go with those armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.4/5">The point that has been made, first and most clearly by the Chair of the Select Committee on Defence, is that the reductions in the regular forces have already been made and are in place and on track to happen. There is no proposal to increase the number of regular soldiers from any quarter of this House. A prescient intervention by the Secretary of State on the shadow Secretary of State led the shadow Secretary of State to say that the Labour party had no plans to increase the number of regular soldiers. The question before the House is therefore how to press on and ensure that the reserve recruiting plan works and is successful. That is at the heart of what we need to do this afternoon, and the question is what will best help and bring about that recruitment effort. I listened to the wise words of my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, who said that any legislative impact that would put a halt to the plans to increase the reserve forces would be a hammer blow to the morale of the TA. We need certainty, and for everyone in this House to get behind the plans and ensure that we can successfully increase the strength of the Army Reserve from 19,000 to the 30,000 that we want.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.4/6">We must remember that as recently as 1990 we had 72,000 Territorial soldiers, so it is entirely possible for us to move up to 30,000. It is an increase of only 20 extra Army Reserve recruits by parliamentary constituency and is an entirely achievable objective. I believe that we can bring that about. We need employers&#8217; help, and I am encouraged by the fact that companies such as Carillion, Barclays and BT are very much getting behind the measures to make sure that we get the Reserves that we need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1311.4/7">We will have full parliamentary scrutiny of the process; of that there is no doubt. We do not need new clause 3 to have proper parliamentary scrutiny of it. That is what the House is providing this afternoon, and that is what happens every month at Defence questions. It is also the role of the Select Committee on Defence to make sure that we have proper scrutiny.</p>

	<p pid="b.1312.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a point about scrutiny, but the only way to get a substantive vote on the issue by this House is to support new clause 3; that is the difference. Members can criticise the Government&#8217;s policy, but they cannot change it without a vote.</p>

	<p pid="b.1312.1/1">The point that I make to my hon. Friend is that Government Members have come to the conclusion that we want an Army of 112,000 people, made up of 82,000 regulars and 30,000 Reserves. There has been no proposal from any part of the House, including from Her Majesty&#8217;s loyal Opposition, to change those figures. That is a decision that the House has taken. I have heard no serious challenge to that this afternoon, given the financial situation that the country finds itself in. The issue before the House is: how do we all get behind the plan and make sure that it works, giving it proper scrutiny, but fully backing and supporting it?</p>
	<p pid="b.1312.1/2">We have had proper scrutiny this afternoon from pretty much every Member who has spoken. Even the most enthusiastic advocate of the reserve forces in the House, my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury, was excoriating about the recruitment process run in recent months by the Regular Army to try to increase the Army Reserves. He is a shining example of someone giving proper parliamentary scrutiny to the process that we are considering because he wants it to work. He is doing that in a way that shows that he is committed to making the proposal a success, and that is the difference. That is why I am pleased that new clause 1 is being accepted by the Government, and why I think that it would be damaging, divisive and unnecessary to support new clause 3.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.0/1">It is a pleasure to take part in the debate; I have listened very carefully to it all afternoon. I find myself in a very difficult place, particularly being a Conservative MP, for two reasons. First, in my view, the cuts to our armed forces have gone far too far. Secondly, I believe that the ratio of Regulars to Reserves is wrong. Rather than going for 70:30, we should be looking at 90:10.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.1/1">Is my hon. Friend aware that the United Kingdom&#8217;s Reserve proportion would, under the proposals, rise to 25%, while in Australia it is 36%, in Canada it is 51%, and in the USA it is 55%? We would have less than half the Reserve proportion of some of our major NATO allies.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.2/1">I hear my hon. Friend, and I respect him hugely for his opinion, but it is slightly dangerous to look at other countries and think that we can meet their expectations. I remember when an American general came to speak to a few of us upstairs about reserves. He had served under President Clinton and then President Obama. He was an interesting and very decorated man who had fought in Vietnam. We asked him about the reserves that America has. He made a rather salutary point: he said, &#8220;In America, having a high proportion of reserves works, because we have the money to fund them. We have airstrips with Hercules aircraft lined up on them, just waiting for commercial pilots to step out of their 747s into them, and to go off to trouble spots or wars around the world.&#8221; We cannot begin to meet that level of expenditure; that is what really worries me. We are pushed to fund the Regulars.</p>
	<p pid="b.1313.2/2">We have two aircraft carriers, but I bet my bottom dollar that we will not have enough men and resources to man and protect one, with frigates and destroyers around, submarines underneath, and aircraft above. It is a hugely expensive commitment that I do not think has really been considered.</p>

	<p pid="b.1313.3/1">I am so pleased that my hon. Friend enjoyed the presentation by Dave McGinnis, one of my oldest friends, but his point was that because in America reserve manpower is less than a quarter of the cost, America is able to afford, whatever size its budget&#8212;it is obviously larger than ours&#8212;a much larger range of capabilities, and more boots on the ground, albeit that some of them are at lower readiness, by having such a high proportion of reservists.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314.0/1">Again, I have huge respect for my hon. and gallant Friend, but it is dangerous to compare one country with another. I stand my ground on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.0/2">I shall not speak for more than another minute as I know that others want to follow and I have not got much more to add. I have huge respect for my hon.

I will support him, although I do not like the element of delay. Why does not my right hon.

An assessment could be made without delay, and I would be grateful if that could be dealt with in the winding-up speeches.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314.1/1">I noticed the Secretary of State commenting under his breath as my hon. Friend was making that point. It might be opportune, especially in the light of the votes that some of us will cast this afternoon, if the Secretary of State could reply to my hon. Friend&#8217;s point.

	<p pid="b.1314.2/1">I agree. I look forward to hearing whether that point is dealt with in the winding-up speeches.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.2/2">Many hon. Members have said that wars have changed and perhaps there is no need for battalions of infantry. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> said that there was no longer a need for the number of battalions that we used to have. May I give three examples where boots on the ground would be needed, quite apart from any conventional war that we might have to fight? First, God forbid that the Northern Ireland troubles ever rose from the ashes again. We had 32,500 men and women in Northern Ireland at the height of the troubles. With a professional Army of 82,000 men&#8212;a large majority of whom are not bayonets, to use the Army lingo; many are back-up forces&#8212;we would be pushed to man that one commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.2/3">Secondly, the Falklands has been mentioned so many times. Baroness Thatcher was looking at cutting our armed forces just before the war broke out&#8212;I think my historical facts are right&#8212;and as I understand it, afterwards she said, &#8220;Never again am I going to take our armed forces for granted.&#8221; Thirdly, for a big evacuation, potentially from a friendly country&#8212;let us say Kenya&#8212;we would need, without aircraft carriers, boots on the ground to secure an area around which our citizens could be extracted. This takes huge resources, immediate resources, professional resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.2/4">I say to all those who work in the Reserves, alongside whom I have worked, that I have enormous respect for them. This is not a question of denigrating the Reservists. I have a huge amount of respect for them all and thank them from the bottom of my heart, as does the nation, for what they do. All I am saying is that the ratio of 70:30 should be reviewed and it should be 90:10 instead. Finally, my military sources tell me that senior officers say one thing in public, but that a very different message is given in private.</p>

	<p pid="b.1314.3/3">This has been a powerful debate. I congratulate, as others have done, my hon. and gallant Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>&#8212;he says not to do so, but I will anyway&#8212;on the work that he has done. I congratulate also General Sir Graeme Lamb, with whom I know my hon. Friend worked closely in his work on the armed forces. New clause 1 is welcome, providing for an annual independent assessment of what the Reserves are doing and, I hope, for an annual debate in the House on the Reserve forces as we move forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.3/4">New clause 3 is a little mischievous. It calls for further implementation of the plans to be halted, which means that things stop and we drop tools at this point. We do not know the time scale. That has not been clarified by the debate. I was a little concerned when my hon. and gallant Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron)</phrase> said that we should not be doing this in the first place if it is the wish of the House to go against the Government. That really worries me, because what is the genesis of new clause 3?</p>
	<p pid="b.1314.3/5">I am also concerned about Labour&#8217;s position. Labour Members were supportive on Second Reading and in the Committee, on which I served, but today they suddenly changed their tune. On their watch the MOD had to be put in special measures, because they burnt a &#163;38 billion black hole in the budget.</p>

	<p pid="b.1315.5/1">I hope that the Secretary of State will respond to that point, because in an earlier intervention I asked the question to get to the heart of that aspect.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315.5/2">I am concerned about the message that would be sent to our allies, both NATO allies and the United States, if Parliament halted or interfered with the recruitment drive that the Bill is designed to enable. The redundancy notices for the Regulars have already gone out, so it is clear that there is no quid pro quo and that we cannot stop this plan and keep the Regular forces at the size we</p>
	<p pid="b.1315.5/3">would allow. The Bill allows a method of influencing, and indeed improving, recruitment, through the relationships with employers and so forth.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315.5/4">On the capability gap, an important question was asked: how will the wider world perceive that? Any pause in the recruitment of Reservists would be dangerous, because the TA is at a lower state of readiness. The idea is to replace 20,000 Regulars with 30,000 Reservists. Are they the same? No, of course they are not, but that raises the question of what world we are now working with.</p>
	<p pid="b.1315.5/5">I was interested in what my hon. Friend the Member for Penrith and The Border said. He touched on some of the concerns about how the conduct of war is changing. I asked those on the Opposition Front Bench to say exactly what it is, with our withdrawing from Afghanistan and reducing in size, to have a standing commitment, and what the armed forces, however they are comprised, will actually do, because the balance between war fighting, stabilisation and peacekeeping has changed. The idea that we have to win over local support is now more central than it ever has been. Infrastructure, development, local governance and the drive for agriculture have all been mentioned. All that is secondary to the war fighting that takes place, but in Afghanistan and Iraq the war fighting was conducted and completed relatively quickly. We lost in those cases in the peacekeeping and nation-building. That is where it is very interesting to see the TA provide value, because it has the linguistic skills and can come in when skills in banking, cyber-technology, civil service and governance are required.</p>

I would like us to have a large standing Army, as others have mentioned, and to be that leader in the world, carrying that big stick. I ask that question because of my concern about the vote this place had on Syria. It was a very simple action that we would have been participating in, yet this House voted against the Government. Others say that perhaps that is not a yardstick for potential future interventions, and I quite understand that, but it could be that, because of the ghosts of Afghanistan and Iraq, interventions in future will have a light footprint and will be very different. I simply pose a question as to what our armed forces need to look like: do they need to look like what we have had in the past, or should they adapt to the type of footprint we will need in the future?</p>

	<p pid="b.1317.1/1">My hon. Friend misunderstands me. I am not saying we should have a smaller Army; I am saying we should have faith in building up Reservist forces with the capability to meet the challenges of the future. As a Regular, I believe that the Regular forces could easily adapt and be used in various situations, but I also have faith, as a result of the models we have seen in America and, indeed, Australia, that other skills sets can be used and that we can build the Territorial Army to match our requirements, not just for the security of our country and the protection of our overseas territories, or because of our NATO commitments, but because the conduct of war itself has changed. We need to consider that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/2">As a consequence of withdrawing from Afghanistan, we do not have one entire brigade training to go there and another recuperating after being there. The size of our armed forces needs to concertina. The new model army and the Glorious Revolution have been mentioned, but what happened to that army after the revolution? It was disbanded completely. This House needs to be able&#8212;very quickly&#8212;to expand and contract the size of the armed forces and be willing to do so as needs change. I do not believe it is right to have a massive standing Army when we are still uncertain about what we want it to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.1/3">That is why I do not believe that the proposal in new clause 3 would be the right thing to do, because it would put a pause on developing the TA. It would stop us recruiting and building up the capability that we would be able to use in all the scenarios mentioned today. I urge hon. and right hon. Members to think very carefully about the damage new clause 3 would do and the message it would send if they vote in favour of it. It would be dangerous for the armed forces and dangerous for the Reserves.</p>

	<p pid="b.1317.2/1">I defer to the military knowledge and experience of those who have spoken before me. The House has had the particular advantage of hearing the remarks of my hon.

	<p pid="b.1317.2/2">My constituency of Harborough has a squadron of the Leicestershire and Derbyshire Yeomanry. It is suffering from poor recruitment and I have one practical solution to offer those on the Ministry of Defence Front Bench</p>
	<p pid="b.1317.2/3">and the Secretary of State in particular. In order to avoid the attrition rate&#8212;the wastage rate&#8212;of those who express an initial interest in serving in the Reserves, the Territorial Army as was, we should bring them into the units and give them weapons training much more quickly, rather than wait for them to go through medical tests and so forth. Once we have grabbed them, got their interest and introduced them to the practical, military side of the Reservists and their camaraderie, we can then decide whether they are fit for the role they wish to play or whether we should deploy them in a less front-end activity. That is a simple, practical proposition and I trust it would enable the Secretary of State and his Ministers to produce the 30,000 reservists and not to lose so many on the way to achieving that number.</p>

	<p pid="b.1318.0/1">I think this is the first time that I will have the pleasure of addressing the House while you are in the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, so I offer you my congratulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318.0/2">I congratulate all right hon. and hon. Members who have spoken this afternoon. This has been a good debate, during which many passionately held views have been expressed and much deep knowledge displayed. I thank those who served on the Public Bill Committee and scrutinised the Bill very effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318.0/3">Most of all, I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>, who led the debate so ably on this group of new clauses and amendments. He speaks with an authority on this subject that is unquestioned throughout the House, and when he speaks on this subject, we listen. By &#8220;we&#8221;, I mean not only Members of the House, but the Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318.0/4">What my hon. Friend has said to me and the House today about the crucial importance of protecting the distinctive ethos of the Reserve movement, even as we move to an integrated armed forces, is compelling. He is absolutely right that we must get right the balance between integration and protecting that distinct ethos if we are to achieve our goals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1318.0/5">I am happy to have made a commitment to my hon. Friend to introduce in the other place an amendment that reflects his new clause 1, which I have to say is technically imperfect, to ensure that this House has an annual opportunity to consider an independent report, produced under statute by the RFCA, not only once, as is proposed in new clause 3, but every year&#8212;not just as we roll out the programme, but thereafter&#8212;so that we can monitor not just the expansion of our Reserves, but the maintenance of them in future.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319.0/1">I will make some progress, because I have very little time, and I want to respond to some of the points made during the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319.0/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" name="Rory Stewart">the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase> made an extremely important point that I fear was nearly missed. One could be forgiven for thinking that the recruitment of Reserves as part of Army 2020 is simply a question of backfilling or substituting for Regulars, but he pointed out that as the nature of warfare changes and we need more specialist skills, we will find increasingly that specialists have to be recruited through the Reserves from the civilian sector. With the creation of our cyber-reserve force, we are already seeing the truth of that statement, as people in highly skilled technical jobs in the private sector queue to join the cyber-reserve and offer their skills and expertise to the defence of our nation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319.0/3">I am the first to acknowledge&#8212;I have done so before, and I want to do so again today&#8212;that increasing the size of our Reserve Army forces to 30,000 and sustaining them at that level is a challenging agenda. We are doing it in the face of ending combat operations in Afghanistan, and however strange some people may find this, the prospect of going into a combat zone is a huge recruiting sergeant for the armed forces, Regular and Reserve alike. We are also doing it against the backdrop, about which I have been completely frank, of challenges with the existing IT system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319.0/4">We have to get the balance right between our central recruiting system and the vital role played by Reserve units in mentoring new recruits. My hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40297" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier)</phrase> was absolutely right that the key to converting applicants into recruits and getting them through the training process is to get hold of them early at unit level and mentor them through that process. That is what we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1319.0/5">Across this agenda, there are dozens of work strands. The top echelon of the Army is completely engaged in this agenda. The top civil servants in the Department are completely focused on delivering this agenda. Countless pilots are under way to trial different approaches in different parts of the country to determine what is the most effective way not just to recruit Reservists, but to convert them to trained strength as rapidly as possible.</p>

	<p pid="b.1319.1/1">Does my right hon. Friend accept that what he says will happen in the House of Lords is way off in February? Will he not take the advice of my hon. Friends the Members for Beckenham (Bob Stewart) and for South Dorset (Richard Drax) and initiate the pause that is needed to get this matter right and then submit it to a binding decision of the House at this stage, rather than waiting until the Bill has been passed?

	<p pid="b.1319.2/1">I will not do that because this is a long programme&#8212;a five-year programme&#8212;that will need continued scrutiny throughout its life.

	<p pid="b.1320.3/1">I will say something about new clause 3 and will then take an intervention from my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320.3/2">First, I recognise that my hon. Friend is a passionate supporter of the armed forces. It is ironic that today, that passion has manifested itself in an attempt to block or inhibit the growth and reinvigoration of the Reserves. I know that that is not what he wants. Indeed, I know that he would like to see more capability across our armed forces, not less. As I have made clear, we have no problem with submitting information to the House for scrutiny. By accepting new clause 1, we will deliver the intention behind subsection (1) of new clause 3. I believe that making it an annual report for annual scrutiny will provide for better scrutiny than what he is proposing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320.3/3">I cannot accept the halt that is proposed in new clause 3. That would send out a signal now to the thousands of people who are in the Reserve forces or are thinking of joining them. The Government have set out their plan and are legislating to deliver it. The Army has embraced the plan wholeheartedly. For Parliament to introduce additional tripwires at this stage would create uncertainty, undermine the message about the roll-out of improved terms and conditions, and cast doubt on our intention to spend the sizeable sum of &#163;1.8 billion that is available to support this agenda. In short, it would make the whole agenda into a political football.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320.3/4">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40455" name="James Gray">the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray)</phrase> said in his contribution, the proper way to scrutinise the implementation of this programme is through the established mechanisms of the House&#8212;the annual report, Select Committee hearings and the reporting of data&#8212;and not by halting the roll-out of the programme. We do not do that elsewhere and we should not do that for our Reserve forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1320.3/5">What I am attempting to do is to ascribe the most transparent of motives to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron)</phrase>, but listening to him I could not help detecting just a hint of an undertone of a hidden agenda. Maybe what he wants is not to help us to fix the challenges we face in the Reserves agenda, but to find a reason to abandon the project. In his own words, he told the House:</p>
	<p pid="b.1320.3/6">&#8220;we could very easily reverse the cuts to the Regulars&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="b.1321.0/1">Using language such as &#8220;tripwires&#8221; and apportioning motives that do not exist does not do my right hon. Friend any good at all. The bottom line is that it is perfectly right for Parliament to say, &#8220;Let us pause and examine in detail,&#8221; and it is in the Government&#8217;s gift to make it a very brief pause indeed. The Secretary of State has still not answered the question. Does he accept that the plan has changed since 2011? We have heard in the House that the previous Secretary of State said that the intention was not to wind down the Regulars until we were sure that the Reservists could take their place. When and why did that plan change?</p>

	<p pid="b.1321.2/1">I have heard these arguments from my hon. Friend before. I have always been clear that we have no choice but to reduce the size of the Regular Army to operate within our budgets. The difference between an Army of 102,000 and an Army of 82,000 is &#163;1 billion a year. He does not have that funding available, and neither do the Opposition. If we are to operate within our budgets, we have no choice but to draw down the Regular Army as we withdraw from Afghanistan and to build up the Reserve strength that will primarily be needed if we again become embroiled in an enduring operation with six-month troop rotations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1321.4/1">I can tell the right hon. Gentleman that, although we have not publicised it, we have increased the recruiting cap on units in Northern Ireland to 115% of liability, and the Army will continue to consider increases in liability caps in other parts of the country where recruiting performance is strong. I can go further and tell him that a review is currently underway to look at trade skills available in Northern Ireland. Most of the Reserves recruiting is trade skills-specific. If we find that pools of additional trade skills are recruitable, we will consider locating additional units in Northern Ireland to tap into them. We have to be agile and go where the potential recruits are and where the skills we need are.</p>
	<p pid="b.1321.4/2">I want to go briefly through some of the other points that have been raised. I want to nail the point my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and Billericay has made several times in debate and in the media. He says that a 40% or an 80% mobilisation rate is not achievable. We are looking at a maximum mobilisation of between 3,000 and 4,000 Reservists at any given time, out of an Army Reserve of 30,000. By my maths, that is significantly below 40% or 80%. During Operation Telic in Iraq, 85% of Reservists responded to call out&#8212;an 85% mobilisation rate&#8212;and Operation Herrick had a 79% mobilisation rate, so I do not quite understand his point.</p>

	<p pid="b.1321.8/1">Order. The Secretary of State is not giving way and he has very little time to finish.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-20b.1322.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40512" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="1322"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131120/debtext/131120-0003.htm#131120-0003.htm_spnew112">
	<p pid="b.1322.0/1">I also want to deal with the cost of the Reserves. The ratio is 1:5&#8212;the cost of training and maintaining a Reservist is one fifth of the cost for a Regular Army soldier.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.0/2">I will not dwell on the Opposition&#8217;s position; I think I have made my views known in interventions. However, I want to make a comment about new clause 4, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>, which deals with mental health. He has a long and honourable record of raising this issue. While I hope he will not press new clause 4 to a vote, I would be prepared to ask the RFCAs, as part of their obligations under new clause 1, to include Reservists&#8217; mental health in the issues that they report on. I hope he will consider that helpful.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.0/3">Finally, let me turn to new clause 6, which was tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40217" name="Thomas Docherty">the hon. Member for Dunfermline and West Fife (Thomas Docherty)</phrase>. His intentions are absolutely honourable and good: he wants to impose an obligation on employers to grant unpaid leave for training. We have not absolutely ruled out looking at that possibility in the future, but we have made a conscious decision that we want to do this working with employers, not against them. That has meant a couple of tough decisions on unpaid leave availability and discrimination rules. For now, we have decided to try to work with the grain, with employers, but if that does not work and we find there is a problem in the future, we will have an opportunity to return to this issue in the Armed Forces Act in 2016.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.0/4">We have had a good debate. I urge the House to reject new clause 3 and embrace the concession we have made on new clause 1, so that we have an annual debate on the progress of the project in the House. I hope we can send from the House tonight a clear, cross-party message that we are behind the men and women of our Reserve forces, who give so much for the defence of our nation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1322.1/1">May I say what a pleasure it is to speak for the first time under your chairmanship, Madam Deputy Speaker? I failed to declare my interest at the beginning of this debate: I am proud to have one son in the Regular Army and one in the Territorial Army.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.1/2">This has been an excellent debate. I would like to mention two speeches in particular: the forensic analysis of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> and the piercing vision of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40477" name="Rory Stewart">the Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart)</phrase>. They both gave the House a great deal to think about, as did many others, in excellent speeches.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.1/3">I thank my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for accepting the substance of new clause 1. I look forward to it being introduced in another place. I will indeed withdraw my new clause&#8212;I made it clear that what I wanted was for it to be properly discussed. He has been very patient with me pressing him on Reserve matters, of which property is just one. The decision to adopt the substance of new clause 1, reinforced by many speeches from all parts of the House, sends out a message to the Reserves that the House of Commons is behind the Reserve forces, just as it is behind the Regular forces. We are proud of both. Finally, I must ask colleagues not to vote for new clause 3, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40059" name="John Baron">the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Baron)</phrase>. Much as I respect him, it would send out a disastrous message to the Reserve forces at this sensitive time. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause.</p>
	<p pid="b.1322.1/4" class="italic">Clause, by leave, withdrawn.</p>

	<p pid="b.1332.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">This is the first time I have had the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Madam Deputy Speaker, and it is a great pleasure to welcome you to the Chair. I want to begin by thanking the members of the Public Bill Committee, who did an outstanding job in ensuring that the Bill was subject to detailed scrutiny. As a Committee, we benefited particularly from the expertise of those who are or have been members of the armed forces, both Regulars and Reserves, a number of whom have contributed to our debate today.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/3">The Bill deals with important matters, some, I accept, of a rather technical nature. In particular, I would like to thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>, who has had much praise heaped on him, quite properly, from all quarters of the House. He brought his deep understanding of current, and several historic, Reserve issues to our deliberations in Committee and today. In fact, it was remarkable to be taken back by him well over a hundred years, thanks to his knowledge of Reserve numbers before the first world war.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/4">I should also like to thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" name="Alison Seabeck">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> for fulfilling her promise on Second Reading to give the Bill a fair wind. I understand that she is not with us this evening. I completely understand why, and I ask her colleagues to pass on my kind words and hope that she shortly becomes a grandmother again. Her contributions in Committee were insightful and constructive, with the enthusiastic assistance of her shadow Front-Bench colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>, who frequently brought his previous experience as a Defence Minister to bear on our proceedings. They both ensured that the Bill left Committee having been thoroughly examined, after more than 40 hours of debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/5">Defence of the UK and the protection of our national interests can only be achieved if we provide our armed forces with the capabilities they need to operate effectively. We have a duty to them to ensure they have the tools they need in terms of manpower, training, equipment and logistical support. The Bill will allow significant improvements to the way in which defence operates in the two crucial areas of procurement of equipment and support, and of rebuilding our Reserve forces.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/6">There is widespread agreement that the procurement and support of defence equipment can and must be improved. It is clear from our debate in Committee that there is a consensus on the need for reform. In the past, under Governments of both parties, too often defence procurement has not delivered the equipment needed by our armed forces on time or within budget. By producing for the first time a balanced and affordable equipment programme, we have already made significant progress in improving the framework in which defence equipment is procured. Now is the time to make further structural changes to ensure that the ground we have already gained is not lost in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/7">The outline of our approach on procurement reform was set out in the White Paper &#8220;Better Defence Acquisition&#8221;, which we published on <phrase class="date" code="2013-06-10">10 June</phrase>. Our preference, as we expressed around the time of the White Paper, is to transform the existing Defence Equipment and Support organisation into a Government-owned, contractor-operated organisation&#8212;a GoCo. But as we have explained, it not a foregone conclusion that a GoCo will be chosen instead of a public sector comparator, which we are calling DE&amp;S-plus.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/8">In addition, as was made clear in the written ministerial statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Defence have recently completed a review into the viability of the mat&#233;riel strategy commercial competition. After a rigorous examination, it concluded that a viable commercial competition for a GoCo provider exists, albeit with risks. We welcomed this conclusion; indeed, we have already made considerable progress in addressing the recommendations and managing the risks the report highlights, including strengthening the DE&amp;S-plus team.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/9">The report also recommended that any further reduction in the number of bidders should stimulate a formal reconsideration and decision on whether to proceed further with the GoCo option. Last week, we received through this competition, which we have been running in parallel with the Bill, one bid for a GoCo from Materiel Acquisition Partners, a consortium led by Bechtel, with PA Consulting and PricewaterhouseCoopers. This is a complex, detailed proposal, running to more than 1,200 pages, which is currently being evaluated to understand what benefits it offers, at what cost and with what conditions. We intend to subject the bid to run a GoCo to a rigorous comparison with the public sector comparator, DE&amp;S-plus. We expect a proposal from the team developing the DE&amp;S-plus option shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/10">Colleagues have asked me, rightly, about what DE&amp;S-plus means. As we have said, we believe that the GoCo option is most likely to embed and sustain the significant behavioural change required to transform defence acquisition, but we need to test this, and we are testing the GoCo proposition against the best that we could do wholly within the public sector. The DE&amp;S-plus proposition is being worked up now. I cannot give much detail at this stage, as I would not want to compromise its proposal. What I can say is that we are focusing on ensuring an optimum balance between the need for an organisation that has the freedom to run its affairs in a way that best meets Ministry of Defence needs, and retaining and building on the values of the public sector. Should the GoCo option be the chosen way</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/11">forward, the legislation that we have set out in part 1 of the Bill is essential to ensure that it can operate effectively without delay.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/12">The Secretary of State&#8217;s written ministerial statement yesterday also announced the withdrawal of the other consortium competing to run a potential GoCo&#8212;clearly, that is regrettable. The Ministry of Defence, with the Cabinet Office and the Treasury, will now study the detailed proposal received from Materiel Acquisition Partners. In parallel, the DE&amp;S-plus team will continue to refine and enhance their proposition. This analysis will inform a decision on whether it is in the public interest to proceed with only a single commercial bidder and a public sector comparator, and a further statement will be made once this process is complete. All I can say at this stage is that the bid we have on the table is substantial and from a consortium of world-class private sector businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/13">While analysing these proposals, we are going to continue to work with our allies and with industry, who have expressed a desire to understand how the potential changes to the mat&#233;riel strategy for DE&amp;S would work. We are confident that through this engagement we will work to determine how a GoCo would manage our international business and relations with industry as effectively as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/14">One of the most valuable aspects of the Committee was the opportunity it provided me to set out the GoCo proposal in greater detail than was possible in the White Paper. We have been able to describe the mechanisms, in addition to the legislation through which the Government will exercise strategic control over a GoCo. For example, through both this Bill and the contract, the GoCo will be required to protect information that is sensitive for national security or commercial reasons. Much of our debate in Committee centred on protecting confidential information and on intellectual property.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/15">Open competition will usually be the best way of ensuring value for taxpayers&#8217; money. However, sometimes there is only a single provider of a capability we require, and sometimes the need to maintain critical national industrial capabilities or sovereign control of the intellectual property in equipment programmes requires us to place contracts with UK companies without a competitive process. This so-called single-source procurement typically accounts for about 45%&#8212;some &#163;6 billion a year&#8212;of the total that the Ministry of Defence spends on defence equipment and support, and it is likely to remain at that level for the foreseeable future.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/16">The MOD currently uses a framework for single-source procurement that has remained largely unchanged for the past 45 years. It is a system that is failing the taxpayer. Neither does it help industry to remain competitive in an increasingly globalised world. It is therefore in the interests of both the MOD and its suppliers to create a framework with incentives to deliver efficient and competitive behaviour. Part 2, based on the 2011 report by Lord Currie of Marylebone, addresses this need. It sets out a new framework based on transparency, with more and better information on costs, stronger supplier efficiency incentives and stronger governance arrangements. At its core is the principle that industry gets a fair profit in exchange for providing the Ministry of Defence with transparency on cost and better value for money. To oversee that new framework, the Bill will create a small, non-departmental public body to be known as the</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/17">single source regulations office with approximately 30 staff. That will replace the existing pricing review board. The SSRO&#8217;s role will be to keep the statutory framework under review and to monitor adherence to it. The new arrangements will operate routinely through agreement between the Ministry of Defence and industry, but where agreement cannot be reached, the SSRO will have the power to make binding determinations on both parties.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/18">Finally, the third part of the Bill relates to our Reserve forces. We have already had a long debate on many aspects of that this afternoon and, as has been made clear by everyone who spoke, the Reserves already make an important contribution to military effectiveness. The White Paper of July makes it clear that we expect them to make an even greater contribution in the future. We need to update the legislation that supports the revitalised Reserve forces and their contribution to defence. Part 3 remedies that situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/19">The title of the White Paper published by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State last July encapsulates the Government&#8217;s attitude towards the Reserve forces, as they are both &#8220;valuable and valued&#8221;. The Bill reflects that and replaces the outdated title of the Territorial Army with the Army Reserve, which not only far more accurately describes the Reserves&#8217; current role, but is a change that Reservists themselves have resoundingly called for.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/20">The Bill also allows Reservists to be mobilised for the breadth of tasks carried out by Regular forces, which is not currently the case. It recognises the contribution that employers make in supporting our Reserve forces, by providing an additional monthly payment, per Reservist, to small and medium-sized enterprises when their Reservist employees are mobilised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/21">Finally, the Bill contains a measure to ensure that Reservists are not disadvantaged by their Reserve service. Presently, Reserve service does not count towards the two-year qualifying period for claims of unfair dismissal. For claims where the reason for dismissal is, or is primarily because, the individual is a Reservist, we will remove that two-year qualifying period.</p>
	<p pid="b.1332.2/22">In conclusion, the thread that runs throughout the Bill is the need to deliver the equipment and support that our armed forces need, while ensuring a fair deal for Reservists, their employers, industry and the public. The Bill makes important changes to the way in which we might deliver defence capabilities in future and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1335.0/1">I thank the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40378" name="Philip Dunne">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr Dunne)</phrase> for the constructive way in which he has engaged with the Opposition. We are not used to that&#8212;certainly not from the Secretary of State&#8212;on Bills or things to do with defence. The Committee as a whole gave a good and detailed examination of all aspects of the Bill. I accept that parts of it are still developing as we speak. Events this week have shown that with the withdrawal of one of the contractors for the proposed GoCo.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.0/2">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" name="Alison Seabeck">the Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> for her work on the Bill. I also add my best wishes as she should hopefully become a grandmother for the second time in the next few</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.0/3">hours. May I also thank the members of the Committee, the Clerks and the witnesses who came before us? I thank, too, the Minister&#8217;s hard-working civil servants who, at times, had to think on their feet when replying to some of the points that were made. I thank them on behalf of the Committee for their work.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.0/4">I do not think that there is any disagreement in the House that we want to ensure that we procure the best equipment and support for members of our armed forces. In the debate this afternoon, it has been recognised that we should thank the men and women of our armed forces for the contribution they make to our safety. We often take that for granted, but we should never do so because they put their lives at risk to ensure that we can sleep safely in our beds at night.</p>
	<p pid="b.1335.0/5">The first part of the Bill concerns defence procurement. The Government have put forward two options: a GoCo or DE&amp;S-plus. It was clear in Committee and is still quite clear that there is a determination within the MOD that a GoCo should be the way forward&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1336.2/1">For the sake of the record, I have said many times before in this House and say again today that we are open-minded about the choice between the GoCo and the DE&amp;S-plus solution. We understand that the GoCo will bring certain advantages, but DE&amp;S-plus might bring different advantages. We will weigh the two in the balance and select the solution that is in the best interests of the taxpayer and the armed forces.</p>

We must ensure that as the process goes ahead and the Bill goes to the other place proper scrutiny is maintained. Not only is this a major change to how we procure defence equipment in this country but it will have an impact on our relationships with international allies.</p>

	<p pid="b.1336.4/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s final point: this clearly needs to be scrutinised properly.

	<p pid="b.1336.6/1">We have been here before with such privatisations, but surely the concept of competition is stretched to absurdity when there is only one bidder. We risk demoralising the staff we employ at the moment; today, we did not even</p>

	<p pid="b.1337.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very good point. As the process goes forward, there is obviously a lot of concern among people who work in defence procurement. It is important that things are brought to a conclusion so that they can have some reassurance. It will be interesting to see how the process goes ahead with just one bidder and we need to ensure that that is scrutinised in the other place, as I am sure that it will be. I hope that the Minister will keep us informed in the House about that ongoing process.</p>

	<p pid="b.1337.1/1">One of the key concerns was that if a new provider was created to run the GoCo it would effectively be difficult for another provider ever to come in and take it on. Are not those concerns aggravated by the fact that we have only one bidder going through the process to start with?</p>

	<p pid="b.1337.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that question and for his work in Committee. He raises an interesting point, as one of the concerns raised in Committee was what would happen after the nine-year process as regards renegotiating the contract. We will now have only one contractor who, if successful, will certainly be in pole position come the renegotiation at the end of the contract, whether or not any others are able to bid. We must consider those issues very carefully in the coming months as the process develops.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/2">The other issues on which we spent a lot of time and about which there are still concerns are those on intellectual property and single-source procurement, about which we had numerous discussions in Committee. I think that industry still has concerns on those points. Part of the process is about not only reassuring the work force but ensuring confidence about working with the defence sector, because it is a major employer in this country. It is also important to ensure that we are at the leading edge of not only defence technology but security technology. Full involvement of the sector throughout the process will be very important. I think that the Bill will have an interesting passage through the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/3">We spent most of the afternoon on the reserves part of the Bill. I reiterate the point made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40269" name="Vernon Coaker">the Member for Gedling (Vernon Coaker)</phrase>, the shadow Secretary of State: Labour Members&#8212;and Members generally&#8212;look with pride on the contribution that reservists make to our armed forces. I have seen them at first hand, in both Iraq and Afghanistan; they are very brave men and women, doing a fantastic job on our behalf.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/4">On the process ahead, I welcome the Government&#8217;s slight change of heart on producing an annual report. May I say thank you to the Secretary of State for including mental health in that report? If he wishes for any assistance with the organisation involved, in terms of how it approaches that, I am quite willing to engage, or point him in the direction of other organisations that will be interested in knowing how mental health can be seen as a priority, because there is an issue, whether we like it or not, with reservists and mental health. I know that the Government have followed through on work</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/5">that we did in government and have added to that, in terms of making sure that veterans&#8217; mental health is seen as a priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.1337.2/6">On the overall position of reservists, after this afternoon&#8217;s debate, I would say that the jury was still out, but we did get some clarification from the Secretary of State on the reduction in the Regular Army. Remember, when the strategic defence and security review was first announced by the Prime Minister, there was to have been a reduction of 7,000; then the figure went down from 95,000 to 80,000. I think the Secretary of State was very candid this afternoon: that was about money, not about what was best for our armed forces.</p>

	<p pid="b.1338.1/1">Well, we can have a debate about that; the Secretary of State still bandies around the &#163;38 billion figure. What he and many others seem to forget is that there was also the impact on the defence budget of the 9% decrease that this Government brought in as part of the SDSR.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338.1/2">On monitoring how the changes go forward, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the hon. Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase> has done a fantastic job. He has been an assiduous champion of reservists for many years. When we were in government, he worked closely with the then Secretary of State to try to improve the lot of reservists. He raises an interesting point about the issues between the regulars and the reserve forces. There has been, in some quarters of the Army, a view that somehow the reserves are second-best. It will be important to ensure that that is not the case going forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338.1/3">It was interesting to hear General Sir Peter Wall say that the proposals were the way forward. When we were in government, he was part of the senior command of the Army that recommended the &#163;20 million cut for the reserve forces. It is important that senior officers in the Regular Army fully buy into the process, because that is how we will make sure that we have the joined-up approach that we require.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338.1/4">The Secretary of State has moved a lot this afternoon; he has gone from holding the position that we should not have annual reports to giving a commitment to them. However, we need parliamentary time, so that the report does not just sit on a shelf in the Library, but is debated on the Floor of the House. I tell him gently that the more engagement he has, not only with the Opposition, but with his party&#8217;s Back Benchers, the better, when it comes to making sure that the best intentions that we all have for our armed forces are realised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1338.1/5">The nonsense that we are still going through&#8212;we are being barred from speaking to senior officers, and barred from military bases&#8212;is not helpful. When I had a role in the Ministry of Defence, I took the view that the more engagement that parliamentarians, irrespective of political party, have with members of the armed forces, the better&#8212;and not only for MPs&#8217; understanding; members of the armed forces also get a lot out of coming to understand how this place and politicians operate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1339.3/1">The focus of debate today has been on the reserves, but the issue of the withdrawal of one of the only two remaining bidding consortia from the competition to run the equipment procurement for the Minister of Defence is central to the defence procurement of this country, and I would like to ask the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon.

There are two processes happening, one as a result of the single GoCo bidder. As was made very clear in the statement that my right hon. Friend laid before the House yesterday, that would require a further review across Government as to the validity of the competition.

Those challenges also bring opportunities, such as the opportunity for more efficient and cost-effective defence procurement. We on these Benches and our noble Friends in the House of Lords have raised some questions about the GoCo model, but I think that whichever model is eventually chosen will offer the opportunity to improve on the past history of defence procurement.

	<p pid="b.1341.3/1">The petition relates to the future of St Raphael&#8217;s hospice in my constituency, which is being put at risk by the actions of the trustees of the charity that owns it, the Daughters of the Cross. The threat to the hospice, which is much loved and respected, has led staff, volunteers and the families of people who have used it to collect more than 5,900 signatures on a petition calling on the Vatican to intervene. Next week the chair of the hospice&#8217;s advisory committee, Dr Ron McKeran, and I will meet the Pope&#8217;s representative in this country, the Papal Nuncio, Archbishop Mennini, to tell him about the petition and the more than 5,900 signatures collected from the public and urge him to use his good offices to secure a resolution to the dispute between the staff and volunteers and the charity.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341.3/2">The petition states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1341.3/3">The Petition of residents of the UK,</p>
	<p pid="b.1341.3/4">Declares that the future of St Raphael&#8217;s hospice has been put in doubt by plans drawn up by Daughters of the Cross, a charity that funds the hospice, and by plans to sell off St Anthony&#8217;s hospital, which shares the site with the hospice and provides administrative and other support services worth up to a million pounds a year; further, that the sale of the hospital will break the funding link with the hospice and undermine the Christian character of the institution; further, that the Petitioners regret that rather than engaging with the staff and supporters of the hospice and hospital to find a mutually agreed solution to the future of both institutions, the charity has pursued a course of action that is not widely supported; and further, that the Trustees have failed to grasp that the success and respect in which both institutions are held is the result of a shared endeavour between themselves, the staff and volunteers and the local community who raise and donate the funds to pay for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1341.3/5">The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons thanks Her Majesty&#8217;s Government for raising the matter with the relevant authorities in the Vatican; further, that the House urges the Papal authorities to intervene to protect the ethos of St Anthony&#8217;s hospital and its special relationship with St Raphael&#8217;s hospice; and further, that the House holds a debate on the future of St Raphael&#8217;s hospice and possible ways forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.1342.2/1">I am glad to have the opportunity to raise a matter that is of great concern in Alnwick in my constituency, particularly as the Minister responding is the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40430" name="Dan Rogerson">the Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase>, who knows a thing or two about the problems of rural areas, as he represents one himself. We have already met to discuss the problem, and he of course has come to it after all the key decisions have been taken, but I still hope that he will use his good offices to try to improve the situation for the staff at Alnwick.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/2">Lion House, which has been rebuilt in recent years, has been in Alnwick since long before the first of my many years in this House. The reason we are considering this issue, which involves 40 jobs, is the Cabinet Office&#8217;s shared service centre initiative, which began in 2004 under the then Labour Government and was refashioned in 2011 by the present Government, and which has been subjected to severe criticism by the National Audit Office throughout for not delivering the savings it promised.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/3">The office has a long history. About 30 years ago it ceased to be the regional office of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, because the Department gave up its network of regional offices. I went to see the then Agriculture Minister, Peter Walker, who was the kind of Tory we do not see many of these days. He was extremely helpful. I suggested to him that he find other work for the office from the central work of the Department, and he did: library functions were transferred to Alnwick and in subsequent years the staff moved on to other work, in particular the handling of civil servants&#8217; expenses. They could have given a lesson or two to the House authorities and the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority on the efficiency with which they managed their operations. Indeed, I am going to suggest to IPSA that it might move its work from central London to DEFRA&#8217;s Alnwick office. I will come back to that. The staff earned a very good reputation, and not just in DEFRA&#8212;they provided a service to several Departments.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/4">What is to happen? A company has been formed, 75% of which is owned by a French company called Steria and 25% by the Government. That immediately prompts the question: what do the Government intend to do with their ownership and board membership of the company? Will they use them to good effect?</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/5">My hon. Friend the Minister has indicated to me that the work is likely to remain at Alnwick for 20 months while the company considers how it will be handled in the future. That raises the question how likely it is that the work will be offshored, perhaps to India or who knows where. There are different views on the matter. The unions are fairly convinced that the work will be offshored and Steria seems to have a commitment to offshoring as a major part of its operation. Of course, there are other sites involved, not just Alnwick. The Cabinet Office&#8217;s position is that non-customer-facing jobs will be offshored. I am not sure what that means when we are talking about civil servants and their</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/6">personal expense claims. I think that they are customers of the service, so in that respect it is a customer-facing service.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/7">What does the period of 20 months really mean? I was concerned to receive a letter from my hon. Friend in which he wrote that the company would</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/8">&#8220;continue to occupy accommodation at Alnwick (Lion House)&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/9">Does that mean that the work will continue for 20 months or that the company will just pay the rent of an increasingly empty building&#8212;which is already a matter of concern&#8212;for 20 months? Some rather unhelpful phraseology has crept in.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/10">The situation is very worrying for staff. Let us consider their position under TUPE and the transfer arrangements. The unions have negotiated an agreement that is referred to as TUPE-plus. There seems to be some acceptance that, as these things go, it is not a bad agreement, but I would be interested to hear my hon. Friend the Minister explain what will be available to staff. During or after the 20-month period, will some of them be offered other civil service posts? It has been suggested that they will, but the trouble is that many of the posts may be down in Tyneside or even much further away, perhaps over in Carlisle, where the Rural Payments Agency is situated. What did the Department&#8217;s equality impact assessment have to say about the situation and about people with caring responsibilities who cannot easily move? They do very good work in the Alnwick office, but they would not be able to continue to provide a good service to the Government if they were told that they had to move a long distance away. That raises a question about what the Department will do, if outsourcing goes ahead, to seek other work for its staff. It seems to me that if there is a period in which the new company reviews what it does, that period should be used to look for other work that could be done at the Alnwick office, as Peter Walker did 30 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/11">After all, this is the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and it exists to promote the health of rural communities, so it must not be in the business of relocating jobs from rural to urban areas. When change has to happen in particular functions, the natural response of the Department ought to be to see how far it can relocate work from urban to rural areas. Of the urban centres, I am thinking particularly about central London, where the Department still carries out activities that need to be considered for out-posting to its rural centres, of which Alnwick is one.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/12">Other questions have been asked about the changes. The Public and Commercial Services union has asked about the tax status of the new company. The Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General said in a letter to me that the joint venture</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/13">&#8220;will promote UK growth as a UK based taxpayer&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/14">What assessment has been made of the overall tax impact, which obviously includes VAT, and the impact of any offshoring, as well as of the domicile in France of the majority owner of the new company, Steria, which is a French company? The union has also asked about the handling of civil servants&#8217; personal data if there is outsourcing to a country that does not have the rigorous data protection regime of this country. Ministers must address that question.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/15">I will sum up the questions that the Minister must answer, and if there are any that he cannot answer tonight, I hope that he will do so by letter. What use will</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/16">the Government make of their 25% ownership? Will they use it to encourage keeping jobs local, where that is an efficient outcome? I do not expect the Department to do so if there will not be a good outcome and value for money for the taxpayer, but there is pretty good evidence that Alnwick provides good value for money. I want the Government to use their participation in the company structure to encourage sourcing jobs locally wherever possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/17">How committed is the new company to outsourcing? I am meeting people from it shortly, and I will put the same question to them, but the Government must have formed a view. What will happen in the 20 months? Will the work stay at Alnwick during that period, or will the office be virtually emptied with the work leaving earlier? Will the office be viable for the small number of remaining staff if most jobs go? What will the company and the Department do to seek other work if the Alnwick office loses its current work to outsourcing, and will alternative public service jobs be offered? What is the equality impact assessment in respect of carers, especially women? What is the tax impact, and what is the situation in relation to personal data?</p>
	<p pid="b.1342.2/18">Above all, does DEFRA recognise that it is the Department for rural affairs and is supposed to be committed to that role? How is it going to demonstrate that commitment to the people of the Alnwick area? Forty jobs may not seem many in the London context, but they have a big impact in a small rural community such as Alnwick, where there are not many such professional jobs and where the quality of locally available staff has been clearly demonstrated.</p>

	<p pid="b.1344.0/1">I pay tribute to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> not just for how he is currently representing his constituents as regards the Alnwick office, but for how he has done so, as we have heard, over many years&#8212;going back to the era when Peter Walker was the Secretary of State. I am sure that they are very grateful for and well aware of all that he has done to support them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344.0/2">My right hon. Friend has set out the issues from his perspective. I will set out the Government&#8217;s point of view on the office in Alnwick and its history. The building is owned by the Department on a freehold basis. There are three occupants: DEFRA, Northumberland county council and the newly created joint venture organisation that we have heard about, Shared Services Connected Ltd. I will take each of those in turn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344.0/3">The DEFRA network has a large estate spanning England and Wales that supports the delivery of its business. That includes officers, operational depots and scientific sites. The cost of the estate has come down significantly since 2011. By 2015, the savings from exiting properties and reducing the amount of space that we use will reach about &#163;53 million per annum. However, the annual cost will still be about &#163;113 million. We will look for ways to reduce that further. In Alnwick, DEFRA occupies office space for about 24 full-time equivalent staff who are focused on the management of information and providing warehouse facilities for archiving. There are also two full-time equivalent members of staff from the Rural Payments Agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344.0/4">Northumberland county council occupies 2,000 square feet of the Alnwick site. That lease expires on <phrase class="date" code="2017-02-02">2 February 2017</phrase>, although a mutual break is available with 12 months&#8217; notice from February 2015. However, there is no indication that Northumberland county council is looking to vacate the site.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344.0/5">Stimulating economic growth is a top priority for the Government. We want rural areas to contribute to and benefit from that growth. As my right hon. Friend kindly pointed out, I represent a rural area, although it is perhaps not as far flung and widely set as his area. None the less, it is a rural area and it faces many similar challenges. The Government have introduced a wide range of policies and initiatives to promote business and deliver growth in urban and rural areas, including new infrastructure, raising skill levels and supporting business, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which make up a significant element of the rural economy, as my right hon. Friend knows.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344.0/6">The roll-out of superfast broadband infrastructure is vital to sustainable economic growth and the creation of jobs in rural areas. Online small businesses, whether rural or urban, grow four to eight times faster than their offline counterparts. The Government are investing &#163;530 million in rural broadband up to 2015, which, through match funding, will result in up to &#163;1.2 billion of public funds. The pace of progress is accelerating, with 42 of the 44 local projects contracted, including all of those in the south-west. Across the UK, 10,000 rural properties are being connected each week. As was announced in the spending review, a further &#163;250 million will be available from 2015 to extend superfast broadband to 95% of UK premises by 2017.</p>
	<p pid="b.1344.0/7">I am setting out these policies to establish that the Government are very much committed to seeing rural areas share in the economic growth that we are delivering, in contrast to the position that we inherited.</p>

	<p pid="b.1345.0/1">I am pleased that my hon. Friend has responsibility for this area, not least because Northumberland is way ahead of the field in its work on rural broadband. However, if small businesses can operate from rural locations, so can the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.1345.1/1">Absolutely, we can. I have set out the history of the office. As my right hon. Friend has pointed out, it has shown that it can be a very efficient place from which to operate. We want to get to the position where the new company recognises that. What is being delivered there must be so competitive that it is attractive on a continuing basis. We would welcome that, but it must be a matter for the new shared venture company.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345.1/2">We are taking other action to support the rural economy, including improving competitiveness and skills, investing in rural tourism, and supporting new micro-enterprises and those that have aspirations to grow. We have established five pilot rural growth networks, which aim to tackle the barriers to economic growth in rural areas, such as the shortage of work premises, slow internet connectivity, which I have mentioned, and fragmented business networks.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345.1/3">DEFRA&#8217;s rural development programme for England has, to date, invested more than &#163;400 million in projects to grow the rural economy. Completed projects have created more than 8,500 new jobs and safeguarded a further 9,700. The next seven-year rural development programme is a major opportunity to continue to invest in rural growth and the environment. We are working together with interested groups to design a programme that makes a measurable contribution to improving the environment and economic growth, while providing real value for money. The civil service is moving to being faster, smaller and more unified, and sharing services is a central part of that. The next generation shared services strategy sets out a new model to share human resources, procurement, finance and payroll functions with five centres, instead of the current eight, to deliver more efficient and cost-effective services.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345.1/4">As my right hon. Friend pointed out, the Government signed an agreement on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-01">1 November 2013</phrase> with Steria Ltd to create a joint venture partnership with Government. The new company, Shared Services Connected Ltd, has been formed initially from a consolidation of some existing shared service centres: the Department for Work and Pensions, DEFRA and the Environment Agency, with in-scope services from UK Shared Business Services Ltd expected to become part of SSCL by 2015. All DEFRA staff previously engaged in the delivery of shared services transferred to the new organisation from <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-01">1 November 2013</phrase>. Services to existing customers are being maintained and delivered out of DEFRA offices in Alnwick and York.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345.1/5">The creation of SSCL is a key part of the civil service reform plan, which will harness industry best practice to deliver Government back-office functions more efficiently. Transforming back-office operations across Government could help to deliver between &#163;400 million and &#163;600 million in savings for the taxpayer, freeing up scarce resources to be better spent on front-line services. Economies of scale will enable Steria to drive down costs and improve service levels by sharing expertise across customers, adopting common processes and systems and investing in new tools. To be a competitive and viable business, SSCL needs to be in line with other companies of this kind, which see some non-customer-facing transactional roles being sourced offshore. As longer term transformation plans are agreed, SSCL will consult with staff and representatives. Assistance will be provided to any affected staff, including reinstatement and redeployment opportunities.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345.1/6">Over time, the objective is to establish SSCL as the pre-eminent provider of shared services to UK central Government and the wider public sector. By migrating clients to a low-cost shared service model, it is estimated that total benefits delivered by SSCL will be in excess of &#163;l billion. It is expected that in the course of the next couple of years there will be some site consolidation from the nine existing delivery sites, and we expect some staff reductions. Steria has made a number of commitments on behalf of SSCL, including: no compulsory redundancies in the first six months, an intent to minimise the need for compulsory redundancies through work force planning, and a series of redundancy avoidance measures during the transformation period. Steria has also agreed that any final decisions on location will not be made for six months. That will be a business-based decision. My right hon. Friend will be well aware that this is a key</p>
	<p pid="b.1345.1/7">point. There will be a chance to demonstrate office efficiency, given the low cost of locating in the base, the ownership of the premises and so on, so there is a good case to be made to Steria for the Alnwick office. However, the decision will ultimately be based on what it aims to deliver to Government and the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.1345.1/8">With regard to shared services staff currently based in DEFRA&#8217;s Alnwick office, we have an agreement that SSCL will continue to occupy accommodation at Alnwick Lion House for a period of 20 months. That is an update on the minimum 12-month commitment that was previously communicated. That represents progress in the right direction, and my right hon. Friend&#8217;s efforts to focus attention on what has been achieved at Alnwick have played a part in that. The Department is well aware of what it has delivered over many years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1347.0/1">May I press my hon. Friend on the 20-month period? The phrase &#8220;occupy accommodation&#8221; is unpersuasive. I had understood him to anticipate that in the 20-month period the work would be likely to remain there, although that would not involve an absolute guarantee on the number of jobs that would remain during that period. Will he clarify that for me?</p>

	<p pid="b.1347.1/1">I understand my right hon. Friend&#8217;s concern about that. He is right that, in a period of transition, members of staff might look to the future and decide whether to look for other opportunities, while others will stay on. The agreement is as described, which is to say that the accommodation will continue to be occupied. The company&#8217;s plans for carrying out the activity there is essentially a matter that he will have to take up with the company itself, but he has certainly put his concerns on the record tonight. I am happy to take those concerns back, so that we can get a little more clarity for him and his constituents about what that might mean.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347.1/2">My right hon. Friend asked what staff could expect. There is an expectation that other opportunities for staff will be put forward first, so that options for redeployment can be explored. I have a great deal of sympathy generally for his view about Government jobs in rural areas. The tax office in my constituency went during the last Government drive to narrow the HMRC estate, which was a matter of great sadness. As a Government, we need to ensure that we explore all the options for keeping jobs in rural areas. He was generous</p>
	<p pid="b.1347.1/3">enough to point out that I am relatively new to my responsibilities, but I know that previous Ministers will have made the case for keeping as many jobs as possible in rural areas, and I am keen to do so too, alongside ensuring the private sector investment that we are stimulating in the ways that I have set out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347.1/4">The company&#8217;s tax position is clearly not a matter for DEFRA, but my right hon. Friend asked that I seek further information for him, and I am happy to do so. He also made a fair point about how the Government will use their stake in the new organisation. Clearly we will want to ensure that lessons are learned and that the objectives of the original project to make efficiencies are met, but there might also be opportunities to ensure that the company takes into consideration some of the points he has raised this evening. Again, I can feed his concerns about that through to ministerial colleagues in the Cabinet Office.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347.1/5">The shape of what will happen at the office has not been decided&#8212;that is a matter for the new organisation to take forward. I welcome the fact that my right hon. Friend is in discussions with the company, which is a sensible way for him to proceed. I thank him for the diligent way in which he has pursued this matter. Having been in this role for about a month, I have heard from him on several occasions&#8212;through parliamentary questions, in discussions with officials and, now, on the Floor of the House. I know that he will continue to ensure that his constituents get the very best service as the transformation project moves forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.1347.1/6">I hope I have given my right hon. Friend a little reassurance that we recognise the huge achievements of people at the Alnwick office, who will be well placed to make the case for how efficient they have been in the duties they have discharged. The commitment to continue to occupy the accommodation in Alnwick for 20 months goes much further than the original 12 months. Some of the questions he has raised tonight will be considered during that period and the answers will come forward. I am happy to remain in contact with him about this matter, and in particular about the questions he has posed that I have been unable to answer without reference to ministerial colleagues.</p>
