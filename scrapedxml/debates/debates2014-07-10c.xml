	<p pid="c.419.7/1">Before I answer the question, I should explain that, as you and the Opposition Front Benchers will be aware, Mr Speaker, the Secretary of State is unable to attend Transport questions this morning because of his duties attending on Her Majesty the Queen in Derbyshire.</p>
	<p pid="c.419.7/2">Road investment is central to our long-term economic plan. We are spending more than &#163;24 billion on strategic roads between 2010 and 2021. A further &#163;7.4 billion will be spent on local roads in the next Parliament, together with &#163;1.5 billion of funding from the local growth fund that was announced on Monday. That will bring forward much needed schemes such as the Bury St Edmunds eastern relief road in Suffolk. All the schemes are designed to relieve congestion and open up growth across the country.</p>

	<p pid="c.419.8/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that answer. I welcome the growth deal for the New Anglia local enterprise partnership, which will help to relieve the congestion on many roads. May I make a bid for support for the A12 in Suffolk Coastal, and particularly for the stretches of the road that will be used heavily by Sizewell C construction traffic? There is the possibility of a four-villages bypass involving Stratford St Andrew and Farnham.</p>

	<p pid="c.419.9/1">I know that my hon. Friend is disappointed that the four-villages bypass was not included on this occasion, but we are still looking at that possibility. Indeed, I was in Norfolk and Suffolk last week undertaking &#8212;dare I say it&#8212;a &#8220;tour d&#8217;East Anglia&#8221;. I looked at the A12 and the A47, which are greatly in need of improvement.</p>

	<p pid="c.420.0/1">I welcome the recent growth deal announcement and the &#163;16.4 million of funding that will be put to good use on the Poynton relief road. Does my hon. Friend agree that that will not only reduce traffic congestion for the residents in Poynton, but enhance the strategic links to Macclesfield&#8217;s science community?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="c.420.1/1">Yes, that is very good news for the residents of Poynton, Macclesfield and the whole of east Cheshire. The scheme to link the A6 to the Manchester airport relief road, to which the Government are contributing &#163;165 million, will improve access to the significant employment opportunities that are being developed at the Manchester airport city enterprise zone.</p>

	<p pid="c.420.2/1">Listening to the Minister, one would never guess that the National Audit Office has warned that the Government&#8217;s approach is not good enough to fix the pothole epidemic on our local roads, which is aggravating congestion; that the Local Government Association has expressed the concern that the Government&#8217;s roads policy will lead to gridlock on local roads; that bus use outside London is down, not up; or that British Cycling has expressed disappointment that the Government are not providing the leadership that is needed to get people out of their cars and to walk or cycle. This is not jam tomorrow; it is traffic jams today. Is it not time that the Minister got a grip?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.420.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" speakername="Robert Goodwill" colnum="420"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0001.htm#140710-0001.htm_spnew6">
	<p pid="c.420.3/1">I am surprised that the hon. Gentleman can keep a straight face as he says that. We are tripling road investment in the Highways Agency&#8217;s infrastructure. We have substantially increased the investment for local authorities to address the pothole problem. More money was announced in the Budget and following the bad weather at Christmas. This Government realise that we should be improving our infrastructure and mending our roads. It is not only the roof that the Labour party did not mend in government; it did not mend the roads either.</p>

	<p pid="c.420.4/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that the A12 through Essex and on to the ports and the hinterland of East Anglia is severely congested, and that the best way to relieve that congestion would be to turn it into a motorway? Will he update the House on what is being done to evaluate that proposition, following the answer that the Secretary of State gave to me two Question Times ago?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.420.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" speakername="Robert Goodwill" colnum="420"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0001.htm#140710-0001.htm_spnew8">
	<p pid="c.420.5/1">The A12 is certainly featuring prominently today. My right hon. Friend is a great exponent of the proposal to upgrade the A12 to motorway status. The last time he raised this matter, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="c.420.5/2">&#8220;My right hon. Friend makes an interesting suggestion. No doubt he will pursue that argument with me and the authorities on a number of occasions to come.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2014-03-20.892"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 March 2014; Vol. 577, c. 892</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="c.421.0/1">I know the Secretary of State visited the west country a few weeks ago. Did he come back as committed as I have been for 30 years to finally doing something to improve the iconic A303?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.421.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" speakername="Robert Goodwill" colnum="421"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0001.htm#140710-0001.htm_spnew10">
	<p pid="c.421.1/1">I had the pleasure of travelling down the A30-A303 corridor with another colleague who has an interest in that matter. A number of areas along that road were pointed out to me, including the difficult Stonehenge area and the Blackdown hills area, which is more difficult for another reason, and where there is some low-hanging fruit that I hope we can address. That is one of six key routes that we have identified as needing improvement, and I suspect that my hon. Friend will have to wait for the autumn statement to hear further news.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.421.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40325" speakername="Barry Sheerman" colnum="421"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0001.htm#140710-0001.htm_spnew11">
	<p pid="c.421.2/1">Does the Minister agree that congestion on our roads is the one thing saving our safety record from plunging even further&#8212;as he knows, it has now plunged below that of Sweden? Many more young people are being killed on motorcycles under his watch. Does he think it time we went back to targets on reduction so that we can look after people on the roads?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.421.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" speakername="Robert Goodwill" colnum="421"  time="09:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0001.htm#140710-0001.htm_spnew12">
	<p pid="c.421.3/1">I have only one target for casualties on the road, and that is a target of zero. The UK, along with Sweden, has the safest roads not only in Europe but in the world. Although it was disappointing to see a small increase in the number of motorcycle fatalities last year, in all other areas we have seen improvements owing to a number of factors, not least the investment that we put into better roads in this country.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="c.421.4/1">One way of reducing congestion in the west midlands would be the new M6 south link to the M54 in Shropshire. Will the Minister join me in continuing to petition the Treasury to ensure that funds are available for that within the next few years?</p>

Only one airport&#8212;Dundee&#8212;is confirmed to get any money so far.

I should say that the consultation is just that. We are viewing a number of proposals at the moment, including the remapping of certain services, but I am sure that he will wish to continue to make those points during the consultation period. When the consultation finishes, we will consider all the points made and look to specify the necessary rolling stock requirements in the invitation to tender to ensure that the best services are provided for people across the north.</p>

She had put up a robust defence of our local environment in the Chilterns and throughout the country. The cost-benefit analyses of this Government have always been questionable, but I would like the Ministers to look very seriously at the benefits for those people who are forced to move house because of HS2 or indeed those who may be forced to move house in future because of the Wigan spur. Would it be possible to give these people a stamp duty holiday on the sale of their properties because they are being so badly affected? Finally, let me say that without people such as</p>

	<p pid="c.430.5/1">I am sorry that the Minister did not mention the Transport Committee&#8217;s report on the serious problem of helicopter transport in the offshore industry, which was published on Tuesday this week. I hope that, when the Secretary of State sees the report, he will focus on the part that deals with the survivors of the last fatal crash in August last year, so that he can fully understand what the work force in the North sea have to put up with every day, and why those workers and their families support the demand for a full public inquiry into helicopter safety.</p>

	<p pid="c.431.2/1">May I update the House on a few matters my Department has been involved in since the last Topical Questions? The announcement of the first &#163;6 billion of growth deal projects on Monday included a raft of transport schemes across the country, with money being spent on schemes determined by local priorities to boost local economic growth. This landmark investment comes after our allocation in June of an extra &#163;200 million to local authorities to fix potholes. Since the last Transport questions, the Department has also signed a contract with Virgin Trains for rail services on the west coast main line providing an extra 1,000 seats, and at the beginning of the week we announced &#163;53 million to be spent on improving wi-fi access on trains, enabling passengers to receive seamless mobile broadband connections.</p>

	<p pid="c.431.3/1">I thank the Minister for that reply. I am sure he will be aware that it is very important, particularly cross-border, that we maximise the use of rail freight in this country, but I note that the east coast invitation to tender document states that</p>

	<p pid="c.431.3/3">on what is a key section of that line. Will he confirm that that is the case and that, as part of this rushed privatisation of the east coast main line, he is making it much harder for freight to access this network?</p>

	<p pid="c.432.0/1">The press announced last Wednesday that aviation security in the UK was being stepped up, yet it was Tuesday evening, a full six days later, before this Department issued a statement to MPs. There is confusion among passengers about what they can and cannot take through security, and different airlines appear to have different policies on the checks and on returning confiscated items to travellers. Nobody is arguing with the need to protect passengers, but can the Minister reassure the House that he and his Department will work with airlines to give passengers the clear information they need to prepare before they travel, ensure that airports have adequate charging points for electronic gadgets, and guarantee that Members of this House will be kept fully informed?</p>

	<p pid="c.432.1/1">The Secretary of State was on breakfast television today making it quite clear what the new rules will be, and making it clear that passengers travelling to and from the UK may be required to demonstrate at the departure gate that their electronic devices can be powered up. I know that airlines are taking steps to ensure that this can be addressed in a number of ways, for example people can be reunited with their devices or charging facilities could be made available, but it is important that we react to this new security threat in a way that continues to protect the travelling public.</p>

Will my hon. Friend make an assessment of the Isle of Wight&#8217;s connectivity and the impact on the Solent growth deal of HMRC removing the island&#8217;s ferry services from the tonnage tax regime? HMRC says it is not going to sea, which sounds a bit odd.</p>

	<p pid="c.432.3/1">My hon. Friend has lobbied me on a number of occasions about the issues of the island&#8217;s ferries. In this particular regard, qualification for the tonnage tax is a matter for HMRC. It is our understanding that since <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-01">1 July 2005</phrase> ferries have had to be operating at sea to qualify for tonnage tax. The cross-Solent ferries are regarded as operating within an estuary, as opposed to the sea, and therefore do not qualify, and therefore there is no impact on the Solent growth deal in respect of these services.</p>

He will recognise that the level of overall satisfaction with South West Trains in a recent survey was at about the sector average, but I recognise, as he does, that overcrowding on South West Trains in the peak hours is a well-known issue and it affects the perception of value for money. My Department is working closely with South West Trains to address that.</p>

	<p pid="c.433.4/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that question, and I am pleased he was paying attention earlier on. It is vital that local international airports play their part, and I know that Newcastle airport is doing that. Of course, the Government are improving connectivity to Newcastle airport, with upgrades on the Metro, work taking place at Newcastle International station and, as he will know, the &#163;61 million upgrade of the A1 western bypass between Coal House and the Metro Centre. That will address not only congestion, but the anxiety that many people feel as they are travelling to the airport worried that they may miss their flights.</p>

	<p pid="c.442.0/1">I thank the Leader of the House for announcing next week&#8217;s business, and for ensuring that access to our debates for those with disabilities remains possible, despite the works that inevitably have to go on during the recess.</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/2">I realise that we will hear a statement shortly, but will the Leader of the House confirm the arrangements for next Tuesday&#8217;s sitting, and whether he will extend it to ensure that the House can properly scrutinise emergency legislation to restore the status quo prior to the European Court ruling on data protection?</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/3">We now have the business until the summer recess. After six weeks of legislative lethargy, just like buses, all the Government&#8217;s Queen&#8217;s Speech legislation has come along at once, with 25% of it in just five days. On Monday we will debate the Childcare Payments Bill. Nursery costs have risen five times faster than wages since the election, but the Government have done nothing, and this Bill will not come into force until after the next election. Will the Leader of the House tell us why the Government will not support our plans to extend free child care from 15 hours to 25 hours? And will he tell us why with this Government it is always too little too late?</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/4">On Wednesday, we will debate the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Bill, which bears an eerie resemblance to the Deregulation Bill as it features such a random assortment of issues that virtually any new clause the Government care to produce is within its scope. Will the Leader of the House now give me a cast-iron assurance that the Government have no intention of tabling 45 new clauses and leaving just 43 minutes to debate them, as they did during the passage of the Deregulation Bill in the Commons? Will he tell us why the Governments do not back our plans to provide certainty for people working regular hours on a zero-hours contract?</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/5">A week on Monday, we will debate the Social Action, Responsibility and Heroism Bill, which has a title that is longer than its contents. The Government really are living in a parallel universe. The Passport Office has tried to claim that everything is okay, but it is still struggling with a backlog of half a million applications. The Prime Minister tried to claim that the NHS is getting better when it is actually getting worse and then we had the spectacle of the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions being dragged to the House surreptitiously to confirm while appearing to deny that the business case for the implementation of universal credit is yet to be signed off by the Treasury. The Secretary of State denied on the Floor of the House yesterday that the Treasury had ever questioned the financial viability of the business case for his pet project, but on Monday the Cabinet Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, said that the Treasury played a role</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/6">&#8220;in bringing to the Secretary of State&#8217;s attention that the project was way off track.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/7">That directly contradicts what the Secretary of State said yesterday and both cannot be true, so which is true?</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/8">As the population ages, more people are in need of care, but this week figures show that the number of people receiving care has fallen by 5% in the past year alone. A report from the Public Accounts Committee warns today that despite the squeeze in adult social care, the Government do not appreciate the scale of the</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/9">challenge. I was therefore surprised to read an e-mail from the Liberal Democrat Education Minister to party members that laments that</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/10">&#8220;almost half of all carers are cutting back on essentials like food and heating.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/11">He fails to mention that that is because his Government have cut &#163;3.5 billion from care services. The Deputy Prime Minister told the <i>Radio Times</i> this week that it takes a &#8220;steely side&#8221; and thick skin to get on in politics, but he failed to admit that Liberal Democrats also need two faces. I understand that Liberal Democrat MPs have been sent to Bedfordshire for survival training. At least they are finally admitting that they are an endangered species teetering on the verge of extinction.</p>
	<p pid="c.442.0/12">This week, the <i>Financial Times</i> has revealed that the majority of candidates selected to replace retiring Tory MPs are white male Eurosceptics. In South Suffolk, the long list contained seven women but the shortlist was made up of three men. A former leader of the UK Independence party will contest South Thanet for the Tories. It has gone from the A-list to the Tea party. This week, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">the hon. Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase>&#8212;a Conservative Member&#8212;admitted that he keeps the Prime Minister off his leaflets, that no one wants to keep hearing about Europe and that it is so lonely being a northern Tory that their regional group could meet in a lift. Where does that leave the Liberal Democrats?</p>

	<p pid="c.443.0/1">I am grateful to the shadow Leader of the House for her remarks. May I take this opportunity, Mr Speaker, to say how much I and other Members of the House enjoyed hearing the parliamentary choir singing with their colleagues from the Bundestag last night? I know that you, Mr Speaker, and Professor Dr Norbert Lammert, President of the Bundestag, had the opportunity to address a packed Westminster Hall. It was the most inspiring and entertaining concert.</p>
	<p pid="c.443.0/2">The shadow Leader of the House asked about the business for next Tuesday. She is quite right: as we will complete all stages of the Bill on Tuesday it is important that we have a full opportunity for debate, so, subject to discussion and a motion being put before the House, I hope that the debate will extend to 10 pm.</p>
	<p pid="c.443.0/3">The shadow Leader of the House seemed to castigate us for not having enough legislation, but in order to do so she ignored the fact that after the Queen&#8217;s Speech debate we entered into the consideration of a number of carry-over Bills and the Finance Bill, and we are now moving on to the Second Readings of the Bills that have been introduced in this Session. That is entirely normal. Strangely enough, she said that there is too little legislation and then complained that the small business Bill had too much in it and that we might introduce amendments to it. It is a wide-ranging Bill. Its character is different from that of the Deregulation Bill. That Bill is principally about removing regulations that cause a burden, but the small business Bill is about making the policy changes in legislation that are necessary to promote enterprise and reduce burdens. This is not just about reducing burdens but about promoting enterprise, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="c.443.0/4">Curiously, the hon. Lady said that the small business Bill was too long and then complained that the heroism Bill was too short. I quite like a short Bill, as it happens&#8212;I think that is rather a good thing. I look forward to the Second Reading debate on the Bill, which will introduce the important aspect of giving people in law, in civil</p>
	<p pid="c.443.0/5">cases, the opportunity to be sure that when they undertake something that is in the broad public interest or demonstrates heroism, they will not be penalised. I think that is very helpful.</p>
	<p pid="c.443.0/6">The hon. Lady seems to have taken to a habit of starting to re-run Opposition debates&#8212;in this instance, on universal credit. The House had an opportunity to debate universal credit on an Opposition motion, an opportunity to listen to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions answer the urgent question very thoroughly and successfully, and an opportunity, through the Liaison Committee, on estimates, to debate the implementation of universal credit. In every instance, my right hon. Friend and Ministers made it admirably clear how we are proceeding with a policy that, frankly, the Opposition supported. It is typical political opportunism to try to cavil as we implement this safely and securely, as distinct from their implementation of the tax credit system, which was, in truth, chaotic.</p>
	<p pid="c.443.0/7">The hon. Lady talked about the cost of living. Let me remind her of what this coalition is doing together to assist people with the inevitable difficulties of coping in the wake of the destruction of economic value by Labour, which took &#163;3,000 per household out of the value of the economy. We are cutting tax for over 26 million people, taking 3 million people out of income tax altogether, freezing fuel duty for the rest of this Parliament, helping local authorities to freeze council tax, delivering an average &#163;50 reduction in energy bills, cutting &#163;50 from some of the highest water bills down in the south-west, capping rail fare increases, capping charges on pensions, stopping excessive charges when paying with credit and debit cards, and capping the cost of payday loans. On child care, which she mentioned, we are funding 15 hours a week of free child care for all three and four-year-olds and for disadvantaged two-year-olds. I look forward to the support that I hope the House will give to the Childcare Payments Bill, which introduces tax-free child care for working families. That is how we are helping working families in this coalition Government, and I look forward to the debates that push that agenda forward.</p>

Will my right hon. Friend agree to a debate in this Chamber on the ineffective and unaccountable ombudsman process, which was established in 1967 and the guidelines for which are now long overdue for reform, particularly given that that was the conclusion reached by the Public Administration Committee in its April 2014 report?</p>

I have a number of things to say in response. First, the role of the ombudsman is to mitigate distress and to provide redress where appropriate. When that does not happen, the health ombudsman herself very much regrets it and she has expressed regret in this case. The Government are considering the Public Administration Committee reports on how complaints about public services are handled. The Cabinet Office is taking a wider look at the role and powers of the public sector ombudsman and we will respond to those reports in due course.</p>

In the next few weeks, the Marine Management Organisation, the Kent and Essex Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority and the Environment Agency will organise a joint agency workshop to bring together industry leaders and experts to review the current state of key commercial fish stocks in the Thames. They will consider environmental impacts, marine developments, climate issues, freshwater run-off and reduced salination. They are very happy to keep my hon. Friend informed about this matter.</p>

	<p pid="c.452.1/1">The hon. Lady will recall that the coalition Government have responded to elder abuse on many occasions. In particular, through the establishment of more inspections and an unannounced inspection regime by the Care Quality Commission, we are trying to give greater reassurance and to take action when any evidence of abuse emerges. That is especially true of abuse in domiciliary care. The CQC is working to ensure that it can take appropriate steps, including inspections, in domiciliary care circumstances, which have hitherto effectively been without that kind of scrutiny.</p>

	Communications Data and Interception
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.456.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for the Home Department"  colnum="456"  time="011:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0001.htm#140710-0001.htm_spmin16">
	<p pid="c.456.1/1">With permission, Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the use of communications data and interception; the difficulties faced by the police, law enforcement agencies, and the security and intelligence agencies in utilising those capabilities; and the steps the Government plan to take to address those difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/2">Before I do so, I would like to make something very clear. What I want to propose in my statement today is a narrow and limited response to a set of specific challenges we face. I am not proposing the introduction of the Communications Data Bill, which was considered in draft by a Joint Committee of both Houses last year. I believe that the measures contained in that Bill are necessary, and so does the Prime Minister, but there is no coalition consensus for those proposals and we will have to return to them at the general election.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/3">The House will know that communications data&#8212;the who, where, when and how of a communication, but not its content&#8212;and interception, which provides the legal power to acquire the content of a communication, are vital for combating crime and fighting terrorism. Without them, we would be unable to bring criminals and terrorists to justice and we would not be able to keep the public safe. For example, the majority of the Security Service&#8217;s top priority counter-terror investigations use interception capabilities in some form to identify, understand and disrupt the plots of terrorists. Communications data have played a significant role in every Security Service counter-terrorism operation over the last decade. They have been used as evidence in 95% of all serious organised crime cases handled by the Crown Prosecution Service and they have played a significant role in the investigation of many of the most serious crimes in recent times, including the Oxford and Rochdale child grooming cases, the murder of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, and the murder of Rhys Jones. Communications data can prove or disprove alibis, identify associations between potential criminals and tie suspects and victims to a crime scene.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/4">I have talked before about the decline in our ability to obtain the communications data we need, which is caused by changes in the way people communicate and the technology behind those forms of communication. That is why I continue to support the measures in the draft Communications Data Bill. However, in addition to that decline, we now face two significant and urgent problems relating to both communications data and interception: first, the recent judgment by the European Court of Justice, which calls into question the legal basis upon which we require communication service providers in the UK to retain communications data; and secondly, the increasingly pressing need to put beyond doubt the application of our laws on interception, so that communication service providers have to comply with their legal obligations irrespective of where they are based. So I can tell the House that today the Government are announcing the introduction of fast-track legislation, through the data retention and investigatory powers Bill, to deal with those two problems.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/5">I want to deal with communications data first, because we must respond to the ruling by the European Court of Justice that the data retention directive is invalid. This directive was the legal basis upon which the Governments of EU member states were required to compel communication service providers to retain certain communications data where they do not otherwise require them for their own business purposes. Indeed, the ruling provides us with such a problem precisely because very strong data protection laws mean that, in the absence of a legal duty to retain specific data, companies must delete data that are not required beyond their strict business uses. That means that if we do not clarify the legal position, we risk losing access to all such communications data and, with it, the ability to protect the public and keep our country safe.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/6">The ECJ ruling said that the data retention directive does not contain the necessary safeguards in relation to access to the data, but it did not take into account the stringent controls and safeguards provided by domestic laws, in particular the UK&#8217;s communications data access regime, which is governed primarily by the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. RIPA was, and remains, designed to comply with the European convention on human rights. It ensures that access to communications data can take place only where it is necessary and proportionate for a specific investigation. It therefore provides many of the safeguards that the European Court of Justice said were missing from the data retention directive.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/7">The ECJ judgment clearly has implications not just for the United Kingdom, but for other EU member states, and we are in close contact with other European Governments. Other countries, such as Ireland and Denmark, implemented the data retention directive through primary legislation, which means they have retained a clear legal basis for their data retention policies, unless a separate, successful legal challenge to their legislation is made. The UK does not have that luxury, because here the data retention directive was implemented through secondary legislation. While we are confident that our regulations remain in force, the Government must act now to remove any doubt about their legal basis and give effect to the ECJ judgment. The legislation I am publishing today and the draft regulations that accompany it will not only do that; they will enhance the UK&#8217;s existing legal safeguards and, in so doing, address the criticisms of the European Court.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/8">The House will understand that I want to be clear, as I said earlier, that this legislation will merely maintain the status quo. It will not tackle the wider problem of declining communications data capability, to which we must return in the next Parliament, but it will ensure&#8212;for now, at least&#8212;that the police and other law enforcement agencies can investigate some of the criminality that is planned and takes place online. Without this legislation, we face the very prospect of losing access to this data overnight, with the consequence that police investigations would suddenly go dark and criminals would escape justice. We cannot allow that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/9">I want to turn now to interception, because there is growing uncertainty among communication service providers about our interception powers. With technology developing rapidly and with the way in which we</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/10">communicate changing all the time, the communication service providers that serve the UK but are based overseas need legal clarity about what we can access.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/11">The House will understand that I cannot comment in detail on our operational capabilities when it comes to intercept, but I have briefed the Opposition on Privy Council terms and members of the Intelligence and Security Committee have heard first hand from the security and intelligence agencies, and it is clear that we have reached a dangerous tipping point. We need to make sure that major communication service providers co-operate with the UK&#8217;s security and intelligence and law enforcement agencies when they need access to suspects&#8217; communications. Otherwise, we would immediately see a major loss of the powers and capabilities that are used every day to counter the threats we face from terrorists and organised criminals.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/12">The Bill I am publishing today will therefore put beyond doubt the fact that the existing legal framework, which requires companies to co-operate with UK law enforcement and intelligence agencies, also extends to companies that are based overseas, but provide services to people here in the UK. I will make copies of the draft Bill available in the Vote Office, and I will also make available the regulatory impact assessments and the draft regulations to be made under the Bill, in order to allow the opportunity for the House to scrutinise these proposals in full.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/13">The parliamentary timetable for this legislation is inevitably very tight. My right hon. Friend the Leader of the House has just provided details of the prospective timetable for the Bill&#8217;s consideration, but it is crucial that we have Royal Assent by the summer recess. The Government have therefore sought to keep this Bill as short as possible. It is also subject to a sunset clause, which means that the legislation will cease to have effect from the end of 2016. The Bill thus solves the immediate problems at hand and gives us enough time to review not just the full powers and capabilities we need, but the way in which those powers and capabilities are regulated, before Parliament can consider new, and more wide-ranging, legislation after the general election.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/14">It is right to balance the need to prevent criminal exploitation of communications networks with safeguards to protect ordinary citizens from intrusions upon their privacy. That is why, alongside the legislation I am publishing today, the Government will also introduce a package of measures to reassure the public that their rights to security and privacy are equally protected. We will reduce the number of public authorities able to access communications data. We will publish an annual transparency report, giving as much detail as possible&#8212;within obvious parameters&#8212;about the use of these sensitive powers. We will appoint a former senior diplomat&#8212;I am sorry, I mean a senior former diplomat; for the avoidance of doubt, I repeat, a senior former diplomat!&#8212;to lead discussions with other Governments to consider how we share data for law enforcement and intelligence purposes.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/15">We will establish a privacy and civil liberties board, based on the US model, which will build on the role of the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, and the board will consider the balance between security and privacy and liberty in the full context of the threat we face from terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/16">We will review the interception and communications data powers we need, as well as the way in which those powers and capabilities are regulated, in the full context of the threats we face. The Government are discussing with the usual channels the precise form this review might take, but I hope that an initial report will be published before the next election.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/17">I have said many times before that it is not possible to debate the correct balance between security and privacy&#8212;and, more specifically, the rights and wrongs of powers and capabilities such as access to communications data and interception&#8212;without understanding the threats that we face as a country. Those threats remain considerable. They include the threat from terrorism&#8212;from overseas and from here in the UK&#8212;but also the threat from industrial, military and state espionage practised by other states and foreign businesses; the threat from organised criminal gangs; and the threat from all sorts of criminals whose work is made easier by cyber-technology.</p>
	<p pid="c.456.1/18">In the face of such a diverse range of threats, the Government would be negligent if they did not make sure the people and the organisations that keep us safe&#8212;the police, other law enforcement agencies and the security and intelligence agencies&#8212;have the legal powers to utilise the capabilities they need. They are clear that we need to act immediately. If we do not, criminals and terrorists will go about their work unimpeded, and innocent lives will be lost. That is why I commend this statement, and this Bill, to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.459.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="459"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0001.htm#140710-0001.htm_spnew195">
	<p pid="c.459.0/1">I thank the Home Secretary for her statement, and also for the detailed legal and security briefing with which her officials have provided me.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/2">We agree with the Home Secretary that a temporary and urgent solution is needed as a result of the European Court judgment in April, because otherwise the police and intelligence agencies will suddenly lose vital information and evidence this summer. It would be too damaging to the fight against serious and organised crime, to the work against online child abuse, and to counter-terror investigations to risk losing that capability over the next two months while Parliament is in recess, and that is why we need to act.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/3">However, as the Home Secretary will appreciate, there will be serious concern, in Parliament and throughout the country, about the lateness of this legislative proposal, and about the short time that we have in which to consider something so important. That lack of time for debate makes the safeguards that we have discussed particularly important, and I want to press the Home Secretary on some of them. It also makes it essential for the Government to engage in a wider, public debate about how we balance privacy and security in an internet age.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/4">The European Court judgment has clearly created an immediate problem for companies that hold billing and other communications data to which the police have access under warrant when they investigate crimes. Action needs to be taken in the short term simply to allow them to continue to do what they have been doing, in a way that complies with the European Court judgment. The communications data need to be properly used under safeguards, but they are also vital to serious criminal</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/5">investigations and to protecting the public. The police use them to find out with whom a suspect or criminal may have been conspiring to commit serious crimes, or to radicalise a terror suspect. They are used in 95% of all cases of serious and organised crime that reach the prosecution stage. When children go missing, the police can contact their mobile phone companies and find out where they were last. That helped them to find out that Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman were close to Ian Huntley&#8217;s house when their phone was switched off, and it helped to convict him of their murder.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/6">The data also help the police to identify people who are sending online vile images of children who are being abused. An investigation by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre resulted in the arrest of 200 suspects, and found 132 children who were at risk of abuse and needed to be safeguarded. However, it was able to reach those suspects and those children only because of communications data. The legislation is certainly needed, and the information is certainly needed. The legislation is a more restricted version of the existing data retention powers. It is because we recognise how crucial the evidence is that we believe that it would be too damaging to lose it over the summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/7">We also recognise that there is a problem for some companies that provide communications services here in Britain but whose headquarters are based abroad, and which have asked for clarification of the scope of the legislation, as a result, again, of recent court cases. Companies should not be left in limbo or put off from complying with warrants when national security is at stake, for example, simply because they are concerned about whether it is lawful to do so because of the location of their headquarters.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/8">We will scrutinise the detail of the legislation, and we will debate the safeguards that are necessary, but we agree that the legislation is needed now. However, I am concerned about its late arrival. The European Court judgment was in April, and the legislation has been published just seven days before the end of the parliamentary session. I hope that the Home Secretary will realise that it risks undermining confidence for issues as important as this to be left until the last minute and rushed through on an emergency basis rather than being given more time. We recognise the timetable of the European Court judgment and we recognise, too, the information she has provided to us in the Opposition over the last week about her proposals, but she will also recognise the importance of Select Committees being able to take evidence, and being able to consider these proposals, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/9">The short time for Parliament to consider this makes the safeguards we have argued for and agreed even more important, so the Home Secretary is right to make this temporary legislation. It means that Parliament will need to revisit this issue properly next year, with detailed evidence and the chance to secure a sustainable longer-term framework. She is also right to add further restrictions to the way in which the legislation will work, and I ask her for further clarification on this, because she will know we discussed, for example, narrowing the scope of some of the measures, as well as narrowing the number of organisations that will be able to access the data, and I would like to ask her for an update on those discussions, and whether she was able to produce that narrowing in practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/10">We look forward as well to working in Parliament to make the new privacy and civil liberties board work effectively, but one of the most important safeguards is the Government&#8217;s agreement to an independent expert review of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, something the Home Secretary will know I called for earlier this year. The legislation was drawn up in 2000. As a result of the communications data revolution, the law and our oversight framework are now out of date. New technology is blurring the distinction between communications and content and between domestic and international communications, and raising new questions about data storage. We need to reconsider, therefore, what safeguards are needed to make sure people&#8217;s privacy is protected in an internet age, and we need stronger oversight, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/11">Previously the Government have resisted this proposal for a RIPA review, and I am glad that they have now agreed. I have suggested the review should be done by the independent counter-terrorism reviewer, David Anderson. Will the Home Secretary tell me whether that will be possible and also ensure that he will have the resources and capabilities and expertise he needs to be able to produce a thorough report which can recommend the kinds of reforms that we need but that can also give confidence to the process?</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/12">There are three other areas, which we have raised with the Home Secretary, and where it would be helpful to see whether we can go further: first, in asking the interception commissioner to provide reports every six months on the operation of this legislation while it is in force; secondly, in strengthening the Intelligence and Security Committee so that it has the same powers as Select Committees to call and compel witnesses and by having an Opposition Chair; thirdly, the longer-term reforms to overhaul the commissioners to provide stronger oversight. Again it would be helpful to have the Home Secretary&#8217;s response to those proposals.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/13">Most important, however, we need a wider, longer public debate on these issues, which so far the Government have refused. The majority of people in Britain rightly support the work of the intelligence agencies and the work the police need to do online to keep us safe, but there are growing concerns as a result of new technology and the Snowdon leaks about what safeguards are needed and whether the framework is still up to date. The fact that the Communications Data Bill was so widely drawn last year also raised anxiety and undermined trust in the Government&#8217;s approach.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/14">The Government must not ignore those concerns or they will grow and grow. It is vital to our democracy&#8212;both to protecting our national security and to protecting our basic freedoms&#8212;that there is widespread public consent to the balance the Government and the agencies need to strike. President Obama held such a debate last year. We have urged the Government to now lead such a debate. I hope that the agreement to the RIPA review will now allow that widespread cross-party approach to having that open debate about the safeguards for both privacy and our security that we need, because we cannot just keep on doing short-term sticking plaster legislation in a rush, without the proper consideration of the privacy and security balance modern Britain wants to see.</p>
	<p pid="c.459.0/15">We will scrutinise the detail of this Bill as it goes through Parliament next week and we will support it, because we know the police and intelligence agencies need this information to fight crime, protect children and counter terrorism, and I hope we can also agree to the wider national debate that we need about how we safeguard our security and our privacy in an internet age.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.462.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="462"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0002.htm#140710-0002.htm_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.462.0/1">I thank the right hon. Lady for the support she has shown for the emergency legislation and I am grateful for the recognition across the House that we need to ensure that our security and intelligence agencies, and our police and law enforcement agencies, have available to them the powers they need to be able to do the job we all want them to do in terms of catching criminals, preventing terrorism and catching terrorists. There is also a recognition that, as we have said, and as the sunset clause shows, this is meeting a gap now; it is ensuring that those bodies have the capabilities they have until now been able to rely on and that those are able to continue in the face of the legal challenges that have arisen.</p>
	<p pid="c.462.0/2">The right hon. Lady made a number of points. First, on the timing, the European Court of Justice judgment did indeed come in April, and, obviously, we have been spending quite a time since then looking at what is the most appropriate way to respond to it. But to any Members of the House who think it would have been possible to put these changes into normal legislation&#8212;into another Bill that is going through the House or into a separate Bill that was not fast-tracked&#8212;I say that that timetable was not available to us; it was always going to be necessary for this to be fast-tracked legislation in order to ensure that those capabilities are retained.</p>
	<p pid="c.462.0/3">The right hon. Lady mentioned the issue of Select Committees wanting to be able to look at this measure. The Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and I briefed six Select Committee Chairmen yesterday, and today I am publishing a draft version of the Bill. The Bill will be formally introduced on Monday, but I thought it was appropriate to publish it in draft today, as that gives that little bit of extra time for people to be able to look at it. As I have said, I am aiming to make the maximum amount of background supporting information&#8212;the regulatory impact assessments and so forth&#8212;available to Members of the House, so that people have as much opportunity as possible within the short timetable to be able to look at the various issues.</p>
	<p pid="c.462.0/4">The right hon. Lady asked whether there was any narrowing in the scope of the powers. The Bill makes something absolutely clear in relation to the issues of intercept. There have always been three areas of scope&#8212;national security, serious crime and economic well-being&#8212;and the Bill clarifies that economic well-being is there in the context of national security. Just for the avoidance of doubt, the Bill makes it clear that that is the context in which that has been used; it is related back to national security.</p>
	<p pid="c.462.0/5">The right hon. Lady raised a point about the ISC and its chairmanship. Of course, the House has relatively recently debated the ISC&#8217;s structure and its relationship with Parliament. She has raised a specific point about the chairmanship and where that person should be drawn from, and I recognise the strength of view that</p>
	<p pid="c.462.0/6">she and the Opposition have on the matter. Hers is not a policy that we have, but it is open to the House to debate these matters should Members wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.462.0/7">Finally, let me deal with the review that is to take place. The right hon. Lady made a number of points about that, referring to it as a RIPA review. I should be absolutely clear with the House that it is not just a review that will look at RIPA and ask whether we need to tweak that; as I said, the review will look at the interception and communications data powers we need, as well as the way in which those powers and capabilities are regulated in the context of the threats that we face. That is important because we know that there are new challenges, through new technology, to our capabilities, and the threat context that we face is developing. RIPA came through in 2000 and we would want any legislative changes that the Government make after the next election to stand the test of a reasonable amount of time; we would not want to have to keep coming back to them. That is why this review has to be that wider review about the powers we need against the threat context we have and about the legislative and regulatory framework in which those powers and capabilities are regulated.</p>
	<p pid="c.462.0/8">The right hon. Lady mentioned the proposal that David Anderson should undertake this review, and I am pleased to say to the House that I have been able to speak to him this morning and that he is willing to undertake it. I think that is very good, given his expertise and his knowledge and understanding of these issues. He and I have been very clear in our conversation. We have not yet been in a position to sit down and discuss terms of reference and the resources he would need, but I am absolutely clear, given the nature of the review that I have just set out, that we need to make sure we get the terms of reference right and that he has the resources and support necessary to be able to do the job that I think everybody across this House wants him to do.</p>

	<p pid="c.463.0/1">Is it not important for the House to take into account that the European Court made it clear that it recognises that there may indeed be a need for such a European directive but that it is concerned that the current directive is not consistent with Human Rights Act requirements and so forth? In so far as the Government have given a clear pledge that the Bill will be drafted to meet those concerns about safeguards and human rights considerations, the Intelligence and Security Committee warmly welcomes the proposal. So far as the other measures in the Bill are concerned, the Committee will be taking evidence from the intelligence agencies on the interception warrant issues and related matters, and we hope to be in a position to advise the House when it considers the Bill on Second Reading next week.</p>

	<p pid="c.463.1/1">I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend for his comments. He is absolutely right that the Court made it clear in its judgment that retaining those data could be necessary. The question was about the regulatory framework in which the data are retained and whether the methods and various aspects of access to the data were proportionate. I am grateful to him and to all members of the ISC for the work they continue to do on these issues. It is worth noting that the work of the ISC is important for the House and for the wider</p>
	<p pid="c.463.1/2">public, albeit that much of that work, by definition, is never seen or heard because of the matters that it addresses. The Committee plays an important role.</p>
	<p pid="c.463.1/3">My right hon. and learned Friend mentioned the criticisms raised in the ECJ judgment, and there were four key areas of criticism, on scope, duration, access and storage. We are addressing all those criticisms, in so far as it is necessary to do so over and above the regulations that we have in place. As I indicated in my statement, our current framework already addresses some of the issues that the ECJ raised.</p>

	<p pid="c.464.0/1">I support the Home Secretary&#8217;s statement and the legislation. Does she agree that restoring the status quo is necessary but not sufficient? She has told us that this information has been vital to uncovering every single terrorist plot against this country over the past 14 years, and she has told us that there are gaps in that information. Is it not a paradox that we are rushing through legislation in seven days to restore the status quo when we have wasted five years in which we could have addressed the gaps, thus leaving the security services less able to protect the citizens of this country?</p>

	<p pid="c.464.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman will have heard me indicate in my statement that legislation of the type proposed by the Government is necessary. Indeed, when he was in government prior to the 2010 election, the previous Government considered the future capabilities that were necessary. That issue needs to be addressed, and I stand by the draft Communications Data Bill that I published and that was considered by a Joint Committee. Future capabilities will be for the House and the Government to discuss after the election. Today, we are faced with the very real necessity to act now in order to maintain our capabilities; future capabilities will be part of the review and subsequent action.</p>

	<p pid="c.464.2/1">In my judgment, this legislation is essential if we are to protect our citizens from criminals and terrorists. The annulled directive required the retention of traffic and location data but not the content of the communications, and it was therefore different from lawful interception, which requires a warrant. Will the Home Secretary confirm that that principle remains unaltered?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.464.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="464"  time="011:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0002.htm#140710-0002.htm_spnew6">
	<p pid="c.464.3/1">I absolutely can. In the Bill we are addressing the two issues of communications data and lawful intercept, and I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for recognising and drawing a distinction between them. It is important that people understand that distinction. Access to lawful intercept will continue in the way that it always has&#8212;under warrant. One of the roles of the Home Secretary and, in some areas, the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, is to sign warrants and to consider their necessity and proportionality. A great strength of our system is that those ultimate decisions are made by people who are democratically accountable.</p>

	<p pid="c.464.4/1">I welcome the Home Secretary&#8217;s proposals on data retention, which are absolutely essential to enable our security agencies to carry out their duty to protect our citizens, but I am concerned about the proposals to assert the extraterritoriality of our intercept powers, which, as</p>
	<p pid="c.464.4/2">she will know, is a matter of contention for some communications service providers. If some of them choose not to comply, what actions can she take to ensure uniformity of compliance with the legislation? That is a real challenge for her. I am also concerned about the mutual legal assistance treaty. It can provide a framework to enable us to get data from other jurisdictions, but it is so slow and cumbersome that it can take months. When we are in a fast-moving terrorist situation, we need to be able to get those data quickly. I think that reform of that treaty is a high priority.</p>

	<p pid="c.465.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Lady. She raises two issues. First, she is absolutely right that there have been questions about the extraterritoriality of the current provisions in RIPA. We have asserted, as I believe the previous Government did, that the extraterritorial jurisdiction was there, but we have chosen to make it absolutely clear in the Bill that it is possible to exercise a warrant extraterritorially. That is part of the purpose of that part of the legislation. Secondly, we have already had discussions with the United States on the mutual legal assistance arrangements, and it is precisely that sort of issue that I think the senior former diplomat will be able to address in discussions with other Governments, particularly the American Government, because the right hon. Lady is absolutely right that currently the processes are very slow and do not address the issue as we need them to.</p>

	<p pid="c.465.1/1">Since it is not surprising that this is a difficult issue on which to achieve coalition consensus, I welcome the fact that the Home Secretary has agreed with my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister on a whole series of safeguards that are absent from previous legislation. I suggest that as part of the fundamental review that now needs to take place of this essential but temporary legislation we should consider whether some authority beyond that of Ministers, perhaps of a judicial kind, might be needed, certainly for the highest level of intrusion into privacy.</p>

Of course, the question of whether some form of legal or judicial authority&#8212;a magistrates court, perhaps&#8212;should look at access to communications data was considered by the Joint Scrutiny Committee.

	<p pid="c.466.1/1">The Home Secretary has justified rushing this Bill through the House on the basis of an emergency. However, the case was put to the ECJ some time ago, and it took some time to reach its conclusion on <phrase class="date" code="2014-04-08">8 April</phrase>, so if there is an emergency, it was a predicable one on <phrase class="date" code="2014-04-08">8 April</phrase>. There has since been plenty of time to look at the 12 clauses that relate to data retention, so why is there an emergency now and not then?</p>

	<p pid="c.466.2/1">As I said in an earlier response, there was always going to be a need for fast-track legislation. There was never going to be any possibility of taking the Bill through the House in the normal time scale, because of the potential timetable within which we would be losing access to this data. I also say to my right hon. Friend that of course the case was going through the European Court of Justice, but until it had given its determination, no one was absolutely certain what the result would be and what aspects it would raise. There was always the possibility that even if it did decide to strike down the data retention directive it would stay that decision for a period of time to give an opportunity for other legislative frameworks to be put in place by member states. In the event, it chose not to do that. It chose to strike down the directive immediately. As I said, we are clear that our data retention regulations stand, but we need to put it absolutely beyond doubt and ensure that we do not lose these important capabilities.</p>

	<p pid="c.466.3/1">The Home Secretary will know that she has the full support of all law-abiding citizens in Northern Ireland for legislation that defends the realm and ensures that terrorists are dealt with appropriately. Indeed, legislation such as this has been used to jail some 300 people for serious terrorist offences, and to protect our citizens. With that in mind, the Secretary of State mentioned the sunset clause. Come 2016, I am sure that this legislation will still be required. Will she assure us that by then we will have something more permanent in place, or have a proper debate about what should be in place to ensure that legislation such as this is operational?</p>

Peel replied that liberty does not consist in having our home raided by an organised gang of thieves.

We need to be able to respond to that challenge if we are to continue to fulfil one of the absolutely fundamental roles of Government, which is keeping the public safe and secure.

In 95% of the serious criminal cases dealt with by the Crown Prosecution Service, communications data were used and were necessary. In many of those cases, such data were an important and vital part of getting a prosecution&#8212;not just in investigating but in prosecuting criminals. Failure to have access to that data will mean the criminals will go unimpeded and will not be brought to justice. I think that sadly, as a result of that, innocent lives will be lost.</p>

	<p pid="c.470.7/1">On the second point, we are still looking at the exact form that that board will take and its terms of reference. It would be premature for me to suggest that it went down a particular route on an issue that it was looking at.</p>
	<p pid="c.470.7/2">On the question of proportionality raised in the ECJ judgment, we have addressed that in two regards. One of its arguments was that the scope of the data retention</p>
	<p pid="c.470.7/3">directive was too broad, so we are explicitly limiting data retention to a strict list of data types&#8212;those that were specified in our data retention regulations of 2009. It also raised the issue of an absolute period of time for which data needed were retained and the possibility that no consideration was being given to whether all data needed to be retained for the same length of time. The new Bill therefore makes the data retention period not 12 months but a maximum of 12 months to provide for some flexibility if appropriate.</p>

This coalition Government have been very clear, from day one, that we were looking at the balance between security and civil liberties. That is why when we came into office we took decisions to make certain changes such as changing the pre-charge detention period from 28 days to 14 days. We are doing what is right and appropriate to ensure that people&#8217;s privacy and liberties are protected while, at the same time, our agencies have the capabilities they need to keep people safe.</p>

	<p pid="c.475.1/1">With permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to update the House on today&#8217;s industrial action called by some public sector unions.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/2">I start by thanking the large majority of public servants who have turned up for work today as normal. This reflects their dedication to their public service calling.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/3">This is the fourth one-day public sector strike in the past few years. The proportion of public sector workers going on strike has fallen on each occasion. So far as the civil service is concerned, it has fallen from 32% in November 2011 to 23% in May 2012 and 21% in March 2013, and today it has fallen below 20%. Every jobcentre opened this morning. Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs has seen a surge in the use of digital services, which helps the drive towards greater efficiency and more convenience for taxpayers. I am told there have been no major issues at the borders. The majority of schools have remained open.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/4">The Government have put in place contingency measures to minimise the impact of strike action, but where there is disruption the responsibility lies unequivocally with union leaders.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/5">When unions go on strike, it is hard-working people who suffer the consequences most, including vulnerable people who depend on public services and parents who are forced to take a day off work or arrange child care because their local school is closed. These strikes risk damaging those who are working hard to get this country moving again.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/6">There can be no escape from the realities of our economic situation. We are still dealing with the damage left by the great recession. As part of their long-term economic plan, the Government have taken tough decisions to reduce the budget deficit&#8212;which I remind the House was the biggest in the developed world. This includes pay restraint while protecting those earning under &#163;21,000. By reforming public sector pensions in the way we have done, we have ensured that they remain among the very best available, while making them affordable and sustainable into the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/7">We cannot afford to go backwards. It is only by taking difficult decisions in the long-term interests of the country that we can deliver the economic growth that we need if we want to carry on investing in our public services, our schools and hospitals and the dedicated staff who work in them.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/8">Trade unions can, of course, play a constructive role in the modern workplace. That is why the Government will continue to talk with the unions and listen to their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/9">The right to strike is an important freedom under the law, but it must be exercised responsibly. Only one in five of eligible members of Unite and Unison took part in these recent ballots, meaning the strikes were approved by only a fraction of the unions&#8217; eligible members.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/10">The National Union of Teachers&#8212;the only teaching union calling a strike today&#8212; has not even balloted its members. Instead, it relies on a ballot from back in</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/11">2012&#8212;nearly two years ago. This cannot be right. The more often unions call strikes based on outdated mandates and ballots with pitifully low levels of support, the stronger the case becomes for reform of the law.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/12">Growth is returning to the British economy, but we have a responsibility to ensure that the economy that emerges from the great recession is strong and sustainable. We must never again allow Britain&#8217;s public finances to fall so catastrophically into deficit.</p>
	<p pid="c.475.1/13">I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.476.0/1">May I begin by thanking the Minister for advance sight of his statement in the nick of time?</p>
	<p pid="c.476.0/2">Let us be clear: we on these Benches have said repeatedly that no one wants to see strikes, not least because of the impact they have on children, parents and all of us who rely on our vital local public services.</p>
	<p pid="c.476.0/3">The Minister is right to say that it is hard-working people who suffer the consequences most, but should not the Government bear much of the blame for the situation today? Instead of ramping up the rhetoric, the Government should have been getting people round the table. Strikes represent a failure on all sides, and all sides have a responsibility to prevent strikes from taking place.</p>
	<p pid="c.476.0/4">Will the Minister outline exactly what specific talks he has he had with the unions to prevent today&#8217;s strike action? What has he done specifically to encourage both sides to get round the table and prevent this industrial action? When was the last time he discussed the issue with the trade unions in his own Department and those more widely engaged in the public sector? What are the Government going to do to change their approach to prevent future strikes from happening in the future?</p>
	<p pid="c.476.0/5">Instead of a negotiated settlement being sought, have we not had yet another depressing demonstration of a Cabinet full of millionaires demonising the lowest paid workers in society? In local government, nearly 500,000 workers are paid less than the living wage.</p>
	<p pid="c.476.0/6">When the Minister mentioned outdated mandates and ballots with pitifully low support, I thought he was referring to the police and crime commissioner elections introduced by the Government. I remind him that the trade union legislation we have today was introduced by Margaret Thatcher, who was not known for her warmth towards the trade unions. We await any details of the Minister&#8217;s proposals&#8212;there was none in the statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.476.0/7">It is important to recognise that, if we look at the total number of all those eligible to vote in the Minister&#8217;s own Horsham constituency, where he enjoys a comfortable majority, we will see that he secured only 38% of support at the last general election. No one would question his legitimacy&#8212;or, indeed, that of any Member&#8212;to be a Member of this House. Members of this House are in no position to lecture the unions about legitimacy. At the last general election&#8212;an election the Conservatives failed to win, by the way&#8212;the Conservative party secured only 36% of the popular vote, but here it is, four years later, still in office, so it is a bit rich for Ministers to be lecturing anyone else about legitimacy.</p>
	<p pid="c.476.0/8">This week we have seen the ongoing, unedifying spectacle of the Minister rowing in public once again with his own civil service. He is like a man trying to fight everyone in the pub at the same time. When the country needs to see a negotiated settlement, what have we got? We have ministerial belligerence revelling in confrontation, where strike action by the unions is almost a public policy success for a Government desperate for a fight. It is sabre rattling, it is union bashing and it is playing politics. It is a deliberate distraction and, frankly, it is pathetic.</p>
	<p pid="c.476.0/9">We are all desperate to see the Government getting all sides around the table to reach a negotiated settlement so that teachers can get back to teaching and vital local government workers can get back to work. The truth is that Ministers are making that task harder, not easier.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.477.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40322" speakername="Francis Maude" colnum="477"  time="012:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0002.htm#140710-0002.htm_spnew69">
	<p pid="c.477.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for the succession of compliments he paid me. Perhaps I can deal with some of the issues he raised. He first raised the issue of the legitimacy of the Government. I point out that the parties that form the coalition Government secured the support of nearly 60% of the voters at the last election, which compares with the 29% that his party secured, so I am grateful to him for drawing attention to that.</p>
	<p pid="c.477.0/2">The hon. Gentleman asked about discussions with the unions, which is a very important question. When we dealt with the long overdue issue of public sector pension reform, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury and I conducted long discussions and negotiations with the TUC over a long period. They were incredibly valuable, and as a result we were able to make some changes to the configuration of the proposals. That enabled us both to secure public sector pensions that still remain among the very best available, on a basis that was sustainable and affordable for the future, and to meet the particular concerns of particular unions. The process was valuable, and if the hon. Gentleman talked to any of the trade union leaders who took part in it, he would find that they say that that enterprise was taken forward in a spirit of proper partnership and deliberation.</p>
	<p pid="c.477.0/3">The hon. Gentleman asked about recent discussions with the trade unions. I can tell him that talks were planned with the civil service unions a couple of weeks ago, but they had to be aborted because the Public and Commercial Services Union was picketing the building in which the discussions were to take place. None of the union leaders felt able to cross the picket line so, sadly, the discussions had to be postponed.</p>

	<p pid="c.477.2/1">Yes, I would, but it takes two to take part in discussions, so that was all a bit unfortunate.</p>
	<p pid="c.477.2/2">Let me point out that</p>
	<p pid="c.477.2/3">&#8220;public sector pay restraint will have to continue through this parliament. There is no way we should be arguing for higher pay when the choice is between higher pay and bringing unemployment down&#8230; That&#8217;s something we cannot do, should not do and will not do&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.477.2/4">and</p>
	<p pid="c.477.2/5">&#8220;the priority now has to be to preserve jobs. I think that&#8217;s a recognition that everybody would see all round the country. We have got to do everything we can to preserve employment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.477.2/6">Those are not my words, but those of the shadow Chancellor and the Leader of the Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="c.477.2/7">It is just worth pointing out that all the right hon. Gentlemen&#8217;s brave words supporting public sector pay restraint fall away when we understand how much money the Labour party gets from the unions that have called the strikes today. What is it? Some &#163;23.6 million has been given to the Labour party since the current Leader of the Opposition became its leader. Unite has donated &#163;12.5 million, Unison &#163;5.7 million and the GMB &#163;5.2 million. That is why it is no surprise, as the Prime Minister pointed out yesterday, that the Labour party&#8217;s guidance on the strikes is: &#8220;Do we support strikes? No. Will we condemn strikes? No.&#8221; Weak, weak, weak.</p>

	<p pid="c.478.1/1">My hon. Friend is completely right. About &#163;12 billion will have been saved as a result of pay restraint in the current spending round period, which is equivalent to the cost of employing 65,000 teachers or 71,000 nurses over that time. The 5% pay claim made by PCS for the civil service would cost &#163;500 million every year, which is equivalent to further civil servant work force reductions of 18,000. Every increase in pay means fewer jobs.</p>

	<p pid="c.478.2/1">The Electoral Commission report on the police and crime commissioner elections in November 2012 stated that the turnout of 15.1% was</p>
	<p pid="c.478.2/2">&#8220;the lowest recorded level of participation at a peacetime non-local government election in the UK.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.478.2/3">Does that mean that the Government&#8217;s flagship policy of police and crime commissioners and those who have been elected lack any legitimacy?</p>

	<p pid="c.478.3/1">I point out to the hon. Lady that what the police do locally affects every single resident in the area, and every single resident over the age of 18 has the right to vote in those elections. When unions call strikes that affect local residents, parents and vulnerable people who depend on public services, such people are not consulted. It is not asking very much to require a union, when it calls its members out on strike in ways that damage the public, to have to rely on a vote of substantive quantity, with a majority behind it.</p>

	<p pid="c.478.5/1">Was it not Lord Hutton, a former Labour Cabinet Minister, who made it clear that as we are all living longer, everyone will have to pay more into their pensions and to work longer? Has my right hon. Friend had any shadow of a scintilla of a suggestion from the shadow Chancellor that if Labour were elected, it would treat either public sector pensions or public sector pay in any way differently from the present Government?</p>

	<p pid="c.479.0/1">My right hon. Friend asks a very pertinent question. The answer is that we do not know. There has been no suggestion of any increase, but we note that when Mr Len McCluskey recently promised to fund the Labour party campaign from Unite&#8217;s political fund, he said that he expected a union representative to sit at the Cabinet table. I think we know what the answer to that one will be.</p>

	<p pid="c.479.1/1">Is the Minister aware that, despite all the Tory smears and slurs today, those taking industrial action are fighting for justice and fairness, and that they have absolutely nothing to be ashamed about?

	<p pid="c.480.0/1">The hon. Gentleman, for whom I have some respect, says that strikes are not entered into lightly, but as far as the union leaders are concerned, they have been entered into very lightly. The NUT leaders did not call a ballot; they relied on a ballot that is two years old, and did not consult their members. The leaderships of the other unions&#8212;Unite, Unison and the GMB&#8212;have called this strike despite having recent ballots with extraordinarily low levels of support for strike action. I absolutely know that no one goes on strike lightly, but I think that when the hon. Gentleman looks at this, in his heart of hearts, he will conclude that trade unions leaders have called the strikes lightly and that they are causing damage to vulnerable people.</p>

The comparators show that average pay in the public sector is higher than in the private sector. I know that there are people on low pay in the public sector, as there are in the private sector, but the fact is that, given the appalling legacy that the outgoing Labour Government left the coalition Government, there have been tough decisions to be made and many people have had to make sacrifices along the way.</p>

Just 1% of &#163;6,000, which is what many of those people are paid, would buy a loaf of bread each week for a year.

He has made the point that trade unions are an embodiment of much of what we believe in as the big society and civil society, and I agree with him on that. He will also know from the things I have been saying during the four years that I have had the privilege to hold this office that I have resisted the repeated blandishments to go down the path of further legislation. I have consistently said that the more often the unions call strike action irresponsibly on the basis of outdated mandates and ballots with very low levels of support, the stronger the case for reform of the law becomes. The action that has been called for today has made that case significantly stronger.</p>

	<p pid="c.484.2/1">That is exactly the issue that has been raised by the circumstances in which these strikes have been called. The ballots are very outdated. The NUT ballot took place nearly two years ago. Why did the leadership of the NUT have so little confidence in balloting their members on strike action again? Is it because they saw what happened to the other unions, such as Unite and Unison, that did hold ballots, which saw less than 20% of eligible members voting and very small numbers of eligible voters voting in favour of strike action? Possibly. The fact is that these strikes are being held on the basis of flimsy and outdated mandates. The case for reform of the law gets stronger every time that happens.</p>

	<p pid="c.485.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-24">24 March</phrase> this year, Francis Paul Cullen was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a series of sexual assaults on children. He committed those offences over a period of more than three decades while serving as a priest in Nottingham and Derbyshire. His victims were both boys and girls, and were aged between six and 16. The judge said that their</p>
	<p pid="c.485.2/5">&#8220;whole lives have been blighted&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.485.2/6">by this</p>
	<p pid="c.485.2/7">&#8220;cunning, devious, arrogant&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.485.2/8">man. Indeed, one of them tried to take their own life.</p>
	<p pid="c.485.2/9">When his crimes came to light in 1991, Cullen fled to Tenerife to evade justice. Last year, after 22 years on the run and two decades of further suffering for his victims, he was extradited from Spain on a European arrest warrant. This spring, he pleaded guilty to 15 counts of indecent assault, five counts of indecency with a child and one count of attempted buggery. After a lifetime of waiting, his victims who were watching in that courtroom in Derby finally saw justice done.</p>
	<p pid="c.485.2/10">That harrowing case and too many others like it form the backdrop to today&#8217;s debate. Francis Cullen is just one of the despicable and cowardly criminals who have fled our shores to try to escape British justice. In an earlier age, he might have succeeded. Under the system of extradition that existed before the European arrest warrant&#8212;the 1957 European convention on extradition&#8212;his 22 years on the run would have rendered him immune from prosecution by the Spanish authorities, helping to</p>
	<p pid="c.485.2/11">bar his extradition back to the UK. It is thanks to the European arrest warrant that Cullen is behind bars at last.</p>
	<p pid="c.485.2/12">I know that many right hon. and hon. Members have concerns about the way in which that measure has operated since the Labour party signed us up to it, and I have shared many of those concerns. That is why I have legislated to reform the operation of the arrest warrant and increase the protections that we can offer to those who are wanted for extradition, particularly if they are British subjects.</p>
	<p pid="c.485.2/13">First, Members were concerned that British citizens were being extradited for disproportionately minor offences. We changed the law to allow an arrest warrant to be refused in respect of minor offences. A British judge will now consider whether the alleged offence and likely sentence are sufficient to make the person&#8217;s extradition proportionate. Secondly, Members were concerned that people could be extradited for actions that are not against the law of this land. We have clarified the rules on dual criminality to ensure that an arrest warrant must be refused if all or part of the conduct for which the person is wanted took place in the United Kingdom and it is not a criminal offence in the UK.</p>

The package was discussed at the General Affairs Council towards the end of June, but some reservations have still been placed on it, so we do not yet have the final agreement. However, we believed that we had sufficient knowledge to make it right and proper to have this debate in the House today.</p>

It is the point that I had hoped to illustrate with the case that I set out at the beginning of my speech, which is that the European arrest warrant has given us distinct advantages in our ability to have criminals extradited back to the United Kingdom and, indeed, to extradite people elsewhere when they have committed crimes that warrant that extradition.</p>

	<p pid="c.487.5/1">There are two issues in relation to that. First, people often say, &#8220;That&#8217;s what Denmark has; it is able to negotiate directly because it has a complete opt-out on these matters.&#8221; However, Denmark does not have any other legal avenue for opting in to those measures. As the Commission has made clear, given that there is another legal avenue for the United Kingdom&#8212;as negotiated by the previous Government&#8212;that is what should be pursued, rather than a separate extradition treaty with the EU. Secondly, I say to right hon. and hon. Members who think that some form of bilateral treaties would be a way of getting around the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, that Denmark has been required to submit to the jurisdiction of the ECJ as part of the conditions of agreeing a treaty with the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="c.488.0/1">That is one of the issues we are addressing. One problem that has been raised&#8212;particularly in relation to the country that the right hon. Gentleman mentioned&#8212;is the number of arrest warrants being issued for offences at the lower end of the scale that would perhaps not be treated in the same way in the United Kingdom. That is why we have considered the issue of proportionality, and introduced the requirement that a British judge will consider whether the alleged offence and likely sentence is sufficient to make someone&#8217;s extradition proportionate. We have written the need to address that issue of potential disproportionality into our legislation, and it will come into effect soon.</p>

	<p pid="c.488.6/1">If I may I would like to get to the end of this list of measures so that right hon. and hon. Members are clear about the provisions we have made in UK legislation. Hon. Members were concerned about arrest warrants being issued for investigatory purposes rather than prosecutions, and that is the third issue we addressed. We have legislated to allow people to visit the issuing</p>
	<p pid="c.488.6/2">state temporarily to be questioned ahead of an extradition hearing in the UK, if they consent to do so. Members were also concerned about the prospect of people being charged with offences over and above those specified in their arrest warrant if they chose to consent to extradition, so our fourth measure is to lift the requirement that individuals lose their right to &#8220;speciality protection&#8221; when they consent to extradition.</p>

No longer will people be surrendered and have to wait months or years for a decision to be made to charge or try them.</p>

	<p pid="c.489.1/1">The point I have made to my right hon. Friend, and others in the past, is that of course there is a question about the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and we have already opted into measures post the Lisbon treaty where the Court operates. We have seen decisions by the ECJ that have been unhelpful&#8212;perhaps I can put it like that&#8212;such as the Metock case, or the case I referred to earlier when making a statement to the House. We believe that the Court should not have the final say over matters such as substantive criminal law or international relations, and that is why we are not rejoining more than 20 minimum standards measures on matters such as racism and xenophobia. That is why we will not be rejoining the EU-US extradition agreement, and we should be able to renegotiate as we see fit. I am clear that we should have the final say over our laws.</p>
	<p pid="c.489.1/2">By already opting out of certain European measures, we have taken powers back from Europe that had already been signed away. The process we were left with, which was negotiated by the previous Government, was an unappealing choice between the potential impacts of ECJ jurisdiction over those measures that it is in the national interest for us to rejoin, or the prospect and dangers of an operational gap.</p>

	<p pid="c.490.2/1">I am extremely grateful to the Home Secretary and sorry to trouble her a second time. This argument that our whole security depends on the European arrest warrant must be false. An answer was given to the European Scrutiny Committee about how many indictable offences there were in the UK in one year, and the figure was 377,000. In a four-year period, however, there were only 507 requests for us to use a European arrest warrant to the continent. That is 125 a year against 377,000 indictments in this country. Our security is not dependent on the European arrest warrant.</p>

	<p pid="c.490.3/1">I find my hon. Friend&#8217;s argument strange. He says that, simply because a small number of serious criminals such as murderers are extradited on the European arrest warrant compared with the number indicted here in the UK, we should not worry. If somebody has committed a murder and we wish to extradite them from another European member state, we should be able to do so. The EAW, as all those who work with it will recognise and confirm&#8212;it has been confirmed in evidence to Select Committees&#8212;is a better tool to use because it enables extradition to take place more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/2">As I have indicated, the Council of Europe arrangements, which were in place previously, had a time limit. Had the European arrest warrant not been in place, we would not have been able to extradite the individual I mentioned earlier, Mr Cullen, back to the UK to face justice, and his victims would not have seen justice done. All the provisions&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> mentions the DNA database from a sedentary position. He and I have a different opinion on the database because he would like everybody in the UK to be on it.</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/3">All the EAW provisions to which I have referred have been made in UK law and will commence later this month. I believe they will make an important difference in the operation of the arrest warrant. The Labour Government could have made all those changes during the eight years they oversaw the EAW, but they failed to do so. That failure has coloured the views of many in the House and beyond it about the EAW, but it should not cloud the fact that the EAW is a vital tool for</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/4">ensuring that justice is done in this country and for keeping the British public safe, as has been so clearly impressed on me and Committees of the House in evidence given by the police and prosecutors who use it. I take that responsibility as Home Secretary very seriously, and it underpins everything I say in the debate and the process that has brought us to this point.</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/5">It might be helpful to remind hon. Members of the background. When without the promised referendum the previous Prime Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>, signed the UK up to the Lisbon treaty, he ceded more powers to the European institutions and gave up our veto over police and criminal justice matters. We got very little in return, but one of the few things we got from that flawed negotiation and imperfect treaty was the option to opt out of all the police and criminal justice measures that were agreed before the Lisbon treaty came into force. However, that opt-out had to be exercised en masse before the end of May 2014. Following votes in both Houses of Parliament last year, that is exactly what the Government did. That decision is irreversible and will come into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December 2014</phrase>. From that date, we must either opt back in to the smaller number of measures that we think are vital for the protection of the British people and other victims of crime, or face an operational gap that will hamper the efforts of our police and law enforcement agencies.</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/6">When the Justice Secretary and I came to the House last July, we explained that we had listened carefully to the views of our law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, and concluded that a small number of measures that were subject to the opt-out decision add value in the fight against crime and the pursuit of justice, and that it would therefore be in our national interest to rejoin them. We listened to right hon. and hon. Members, and carefully considered the reports of the European Scrutiny Committee, the Home Affairs Committee and the Justice Committee, before opening formal negotiations with the European Commission, the Council and other member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/7">Good progress has been made, and I am pleased to be able to report that we have reached an in-principle deal with the Commission on the non-Schengen measures, which fall under its purview, and we have made good progress on the Schengen measures, on which the outline of a possible deal is now clear. I indicated earlier that the matter was discussed at the General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-24">24 June</phrase>, but technical reservations remain, and discussions continue with the aim of allowing those reservations to be lifted. Therefore, the negotiations are ongoing, but as I have said, the Justice Secretary and I have been clear throughout that we will update Parliament as appropriate and give right hon. and hon. Members the opportunity to debate the issue. That is what we are doing today. Last week, we published the Command Paper&#8212;Cm 8897&#8212;which includes the full list of measures that were discussed at the General Affairs Council, and impact assessments on each of the measures. That fulfils the Government&#8217;s commitment to provide those impact assessments and further demonstrates our commitment to parliamentary scrutiny of the matter.</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/8">Many were sceptical that a deal could be done, and many believed that the European Commission and other member states would force the UK into measures that we did not want to rejoin, but I am proud to say that we</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/9">have been able to resist many of the changes demanded by others, and have not been pushed into rejoining a larger number of measures. We are clear that the deal is a good deal for the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/10">One measure that we have successfully resisted joining is Pr&#252;m, a system that allows the police to check DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data. I have been clear in the House previously that we have neither the time nor the money to implement Pr&#252;m by <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>. I have said that it will be senseless for us to rejoin it now and risk being infracted. Despite considerable pressure from the Commission and other member states, that remains the case.</p>
	<p pid="c.490.3/11">All hon. Members want the most serious crimes such as rapes and murders to be solved and their perpetrators brought to justice. In some cases, that will mean the police comparing DNA or fingerprint data with those held by other European forces. Thirty per cent. of those arrested in London are foreign nationals, so it is clear that that is an operational necessity. Therefore, the comparisons already happen, and must do so if we are to solve cross-border crime. I would be negligent in my duty to protect the British public if I did not consider the issue carefully.</p>

	<p pid="c.492.0/1">Will my right hon. Friend explain to the House why it is so important to have those cross-border co-operation arrangements with the EU and not with the entire world?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.492.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="492"  time="012:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0002.htm#140710-0002.htm_spnew142">
	<p pid="c.492.1/1">Our police forces of course co-operate with other police forces throughout the world in bringing criminals and perpetrators to justice. The European arrest warrant&#8212;I will repeat myself&#8212;is an extradition arrangement that improves on the extradition arrangements that we had previously. I recognise that there have been concerns about it, but we have legislated on those concerns here in this Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.492.1/2">I was describing the Pr&#252;m system, which is about the easy, efficient and effective comparison of data when appropriate. We have been clear that we cannot rejoin that on <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase> and would not seek to do so. However, in order for the House to consider the matter carefully, the Government will produce a business and implementation case and run a small-scale pilot with all the necessary safeguards in place. We will publish that by way of a Command Paper and bring the issue back to Parliament so that it can be debated in an informed way. We are working towards doing so by the end of next year. However, the decision on whether to rejoin Pr&#252;m would be one for Parliament. Unlike the Labour Government, who signed us up to that measure in the first place without any idea how much it would cost or how it would be implemented, the Government will ensure that Parliament has the full facts to inform its decision.</p>
	<p pid="c.492.1/3">On another subject, I know that my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary will want to address the probation situation in his closing remarks&#8212;that is another measure we have successfully resisted rejoining.</p>
	<p pid="c.492.1/4">The Government propose to rejoin other measures in the national interest. We wish to rejoin the European supervision order, which allows British subjects to be bailed back to the UK rather than spending months abroad awaiting trial. That will stand alongside the reforms we have made to the European arrest warrant,</p>
	<p pid="c.492.1/5">and make it easier for people such as Mr Symeou to be bailed back to the UK and prevent such injustices from occurring in future.</p>
	<p pid="c.492.1/6">We are also seeking to rejoin the prisoner transfer framework decision, a measure that my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary considers important. The framework helps us to remove foreign criminals from British jails&#8212;prisoners such as Ainars Zvirgzds, a Latvian national convicted of controlling prostitution, assault, and firearms and drug offences. In April 2012, he was sentenced to 13 and a half years imprisonment in the UK. Last month, he was transferred out of this country to a prison in Latvia, where he will serve the remainder of his sentence. Had it not been for the prison transfer measure, he would have remained in a British prison, at a cost to the British taxpayer of more than &#163;100,000.</p>
	<p pid="c.492.1/7">We wish to rejoin the measure providing for joint investigation teams, so that we can continue to participate in cross-border operations such as Operation Birkhill. That collaboration with Hungary, funded by Eurojust and assisted by Europol, led to five criminals being sentenced at Croydon Crown court last month to a total of 36 years imprisonment for their involvement in trafficking more than 120 women into the United Kingdom from Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland. One of those convicted, Vishal Chaudhary, lived in a luxury Canary Wharf penthouse and drove a flashy sports car bought from the money he made selling those women for sex. Chaudhary and his gang managed their operation from a semi-detached house on a suburban street in Hendon, and operated more than 40 brothels across London, including in Enfield and Brent. Their victims were threatened with abuse if they tried to contact their families. Some were forced to have sex with up to 20 clients a day. These are the victims of crime that the measures we are debating to day help. Joint investigation teams are a vital tool in the fight against modern slavery, a crime this House so passionately demonstrated earlier this week it wants to see tackled. I hope the House will support rejoining the measures that will help us to do that.</p>

	<p pid="c.493.0/1">I support everything the Home Secretary has said in respect of these policing issues. However, why have we not rejoined the European criminal information system, which would have provided us with information on those who come into this country and already have criminal convictions?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.493.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="493"  time="012:53:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0002.htm#140710-0002.htm_spnew144">
	<p pid="c.493.1/1">We discussed the measure the right hon. Gentleman refers to in front of his Committee and other Committees. There are a number ways in which we deal with these matters in terms of exchanging information. I want to be sure that I am looking at the measures to which he is referring and I think that they are Council Framework Decisions 2009/315/JHA and 2009/316/JHA. They require member states to inform each other about convictions of EU nationals and are an important tool for sharing data. The reason I am hesitating here is that we were certainly discussing the possibility of rejoining this particular measure. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It is in the 35. Yes, that is why I was hesitating. The right hon. Gentleman said we were not</p>
	<p pid="c.493.1/2">in it and I thought it was in the 35 measures we are rejoining, precisely because it gives us the opportunity to share this information.</p>
	<p pid="c.493.1/3">We also wish to rejoin the Naples II convention, the principal tool for customs co-operation. Operation Stoplamp, which used this measure to exchange vital information with our partners, resulted in the seizure of 1.2 tonnes of cocaine with a street value of about &#163;300 million&#8212;again, an outcome I am sure everyone in this House will welcome. We are also seeking to rejoin Europol, which played a key role in helping our law enforcement agencies to fight those criminals who tried to exploit British customers by adulterating our food with horsemeat. It is doing excellent work under the leadership of its British director, Rob Wainwright.</p>
	<p pid="c.493.1/4">Those are just a handful of examples that illustrate why our participation in these measures is in our national interest. Today&#8217;s debate is not about the flawed treaty to which the previous Labour Government signed us up; it is about the decisions we must take now to protect the public and keep the British people safe. The Government&#8217;s policy is clear: we have exercised the opt-out and negotiated a deal to rejoin a limited number of measures that we believe it is in the national interest for us to remain part of.</p>
	<p pid="c.493.1/5">I look forward with interest to the speech from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase>, as it would be helpful to know the Opposition&#8217;s position on these various measures. Every time we debate them, we see a slightly different position coming forward. I am sorry that the shadow Home Secretary is not here to tell us herself, but perhaps the right hon. Gentleman will be able to tell us whether they would have exercised the opt-out that they negotiated. Would they have remained bound by all 130-plus measures, rather than negotiating a limited number in the national interest? Would they have changed the law to protect British citizens, as we have done in relation to the European arrest warrant? Would they have risked infraction proceedings by rejoining Pr&#252;m without fully considering the facts?</p>
	<p pid="c.493.1/6">The evidence suggests that the Opposition do not share the determination of this party and this Government to reduce the control Brussels has on our criminal justice system. Their position has always been to say one thing and do another. There was a manifesto promise for a vote on the Lisbon treaty, but they refused to hold a referendum. They said they would protect British red lines, but they gave up our veto in policing and criminal justice matters. They negotiated an opt-out and then voted against using it. That contrasts with the position taken by this Government. We support, and have exercised, the United Kingdom&#8217;s opt-out. We support the return of powers from Brussels to the UK. We support acting in the national interest by rejoining a limited number of measures to protect British citizens and the victims of crime. This is consistent with our approach to the Europe Union as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="c.494.0/1">I notice that the title of the debate actually refers to opt-outs. Apart from Pr&#252;m, can the Home Secretary name one thing that they are not opting into that will make a significant difference in repatriating competence to the UK&#8212;one single issue apart from Pr&#252;m?</p>

	<p pid="c.495.0/1">It is not that we are opting back into Pr&#252;m. We did not join Pr&#252;m in the first place, so that is rather different from the measures in the 35. My right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary has spoken in front of Select Committees on a number of occasions on the importance of not opting into those minimum standards measures in relation to the justice system. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman has a look at those.</p>
	<p pid="c.495.0/2">The Prime Minister has repeatedly taken tough action to stand up for Britain in Europe by cutting the EU budget, saving British taxpayers more than &#163;8 billion, vetoing a new EU fiscal treaty that did not guarantee a level playing field for British businesses and refusing to spend British taxes on bailing out the euro. It is under this Prime Minister that Britain did not budge on the principle that it should be for the elected Heads of national Governments, not the European Parliament, to propose the President of the European Commission. What I have outlined today is another example of this Government standing up for the United Kingdom&#8217;s best interests, bringing powers back home while doing all we can to keep the British people safe. That is the sort of leadership in Europe that this country needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.495.1/1">For 30 of the past 35 minutes, the Home Secretary had me on board. It was only in the last five minutes that she lost me. It was almost a first. I appreciate that we have a meeting of minds on several issues. I was probably more in tune with her than she is with some of her own right hon. and hon. Friends&#8212;an unusual situation in which to find myself.</p>
	<p pid="c.495.1/2">I thank the Home Secretary for her contribution, on which there is a large element of agreement with the Opposition. I also thank the three Select Committee Chairs, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase> my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> for their contributions to the discussions on these key matters.</p>
	<p pid="c.495.1/3">We have been here before and I suspect, given what the Home Secretary said, that we will be here again before the end of the year. I can see from the contributions from her own side, in particular from Government Members here today who perhaps have a greater level of euroscepticism than I do, that there was not a universal welcome for her statement. There will not be a universal welcome for her projected policy positions later this year, but I want to be positive if I can and support the Home Secretary&#8217;s objectives.</p>
	<p pid="c.495.1/4">The motion today is that this House has considered, not decided on, the opt-outs. My first point is one the Home Secretary touched on, but we would welcome clarification. It goes back to the point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase>: when will there be a final package on these measures and when will we be able to not just debate but vote on them? December is looming and I would like at some point to have an indication, from the Home Secretary or the Justice Secretary, of when we can expect to have a vote. At the moment, there is no clarity on when that final vote will be.</p>

	<p pid="c.496.1/1">I am relaxed on that, but I do want the European arrest warrant put in place. We have had some safeguards, but I will outline in due course the reasons why I want to see it put in place. It would be helpful to have clarity on when the discussions will be concluded and can be voted on. I appreciate that the Home Secretary has some difficulties, but it would be helpful to the House, for the reasons set out by my right hon.

Technology has moved on in the last 15 to 20 years, which means that there are a range of issues that need to be addressed not just within the boundaries of the United Kingdom, but across Europe as a whole.

	<p pid="c.497.0/1">As I think the Home Secretary also indicated in our little t&#234;te-&#224;-t&#234;te of agreement, there is a wider world outside Europe, but we have strong ties with Europe. We have free movement in Europe on a range of matters. We do not have free movement from outside the European Community, so there are issues that we should ensure we deal with within the European Community.</p>

	<p pid="c.497.1/1">We appear to be reaching an extraordinary position, in that the right hon. Gentleman seems to be advocating the free movement of people all around the EU, so that criminals can come and go as they please, but then we need these ridiculous measures to try to deal with that. Why do we not just take a more simplistic approach and scrap the free movement of people? Then perhaps we would not need all these ridiculous measures in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="c.497.2/1">Again, I think the hon. Gentleman perhaps has more in common with other parties than his own on that issue. Some of the changes that have taken place&#8212;in technology, free movement, cybercrime, new forms of crime, child prostitution, trafficking and drugs&#8212;demand a Europe-wide solution, and I think the Home Secretary has accepted that. They are international crimes that know no borders and they need international solutions. Each crime is creating new victims. I believe it is the duty of this House to ensure that we work with our European partners to reduce that crime, bringing criminals to justice and, yes, co-operating to do so.</p>

I believe that if he went back to south London this evening and asked his constituents whether they wanted effective co-operation to tackle drug abuse, child trafficking, prostitution and international terrorism, the answer would be a resounding yes. It is something the Home Secretary believes is right; it is something we believe is right.</p>

	<p pid="c.499.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his contribution, but what those effective means are is a fair debate to have. I believe, as I think his right hon. Friend the Home Secretary does, that those things are best done through European co-operation. Indeed, the European arrest warrant has been of interest today, so let me quote from a statement made last year:</p>
	<p pid="c.499.1/2">&#8220;Since 2009 alone, the arrest warrant has been used to extradite from the UK 57 suspects for child sex offences, 86 for rape and 105 for murder&#8230;63 suspects for child sex offences, 27 for rape and 44 for murder were extradited back to Britain to face charges. A number of these suspects would probably have not been extradited back to Britain without the arrest warrant. We owe it to their victims, and to their loved ones, to bring these people to justice.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2013-07-09.178"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 July 2013; Vol. 566, c. 178</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.499.1/3">That was the Home Secretary, speaking last year. I say to the hon. Gentleman that, irrespective of his views, those individuals were brought back by that arrest warrant. The alternative suggestion, made by the right hon. Member for Wokingham, is one where we negotiate X number of individual arrest warrants&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="c.499.3/1">I happen to think&#8212;it is a matter of debate and it will develop during the afternoon&#8212;that this is a far better way of dealing with the problem than we have now.</p>
	<p pid="c.499.3/2">Today&#8217;s debate is one in a series. We have waited and waited; we have had debates and debates; the bus arrives, with not one, but two or three coming at once; yet the Home Secretary has not yet brought the final measures before the House. To be honest, I think that the right hon. Lady would rather be at the dentist having her teeth pulled than be here having the discussion she is having with her right hon. and hon. Friends. She has been brought to this debate by the three Select Committees, which are eventually getting the Home Secretary&#8217;s capitulation to common sense and European-wide justice and co-operation. It has, I think, hit the right hon. Lady, after looking at the matter in detail, that it is rather useful for our police to have access to criminal records or driving offences for when European lorry drivers tear up the M1 or the M6.</p>
	<p pid="c.499.3/3">The truth is that the Home Secretary&#8217;s opt-out strategy ultimately becomes an opt-in strategy. The measure of the complexity of the negotiations is indicated by the fact that she is now acting in the interests of Britain</p>
	<p pid="c.499.3/4">rather than in the interests of Conservative Back Benchers and the Eurosceptic Members here today. She has promised to garner favour with the Tory right, but she is ultimately opting into measures that we support because she now understands that the police want European co-operation and that criminals are not Eurosceptics. She understands that our ability to bring them to book and to get justice for their victims should not be compromised.</p>
	<p pid="c.499.3/5">The issue of the transfer of powers is interesting. The right hon. Lady has said what she is opting into, but she has not said what she is opting out of. These are not really significant matters. She has looked at opting out of issues such as signing joint proceedings on driving licences that are not in force and are out of date. We are not signing up to a directive on international organised crime that was closed down two years ago. We are not signing up to guidelines on working with other countries on drug trafficking, but we will carry on doing that anyway. We are not going to sign up to measures on cybercrime or mutual legal assistance because they have been superseded by other measures to which we signed up instead. We are not signing up to minimum standards on bribery because we are meeting them under our own Bribery Act 2010. We are not signing up to measures to tackle racism because we meet them under hate crime legislation that is in place. We are not signing up to measures on accession because they never applied to us in the first place, and we are not signing up to receive a directory of specialist counter-terrorism officers because someone will probably send it to us in the post instead.</p>
	<p pid="c.499.3/6">The measures that the Home Secretary is signing up to are sensible ones, whereas the ones she is not signing up to are either from the past, superseded, not relevant or not appropriate for us. The right hon. Lady has posed as the great Eurosceptic champion of the Conservative Government when what she has done is to sign up to things that I would sign up to, which many of her hon. Friends would not sign up to. The things that she has not signed up to are things that are, as I say, not relevant, not appropriate and not needed now.</p>

The Home Secretary has tried to be Eurosceptic and to compromise with her Eurosceptic Back Benchers, but they will never compromise on these issues. She needs to take a firm stance to ensure that the House has a vote and agrees these measures because they are good for crime prevention, good for victims and good for bringing people to justice.

	<p pid="c.501.2/1">This issue is not at all about shaking off Eurosceptics; it is about deciding what is sensible for the United Kingdom in line with our values, our traditions and our own rule of law. As many right hon. and hon. Members have indicated, there is no reason for these provisions that could not have been achieved by other means. Furthermore, I have still not had an answer to the question: what is so special about the European Union and the cross-border arrangements that operate within it, compared with anywhere else in the world, where we will find murderers, traffickers and all the other problems that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary mentioned? They problems are found in the rest of the world and in Europe, yet we have these special arrangements for Europe alone. The answer is simple: it is about sovereignty.</p>
	<p pid="c.501.2/2">This is all about giving in to the European Union, through the European Communities Act 1972. Watching both Front-Bench teams is rather like watching an attempt to get out of a paper bag&#8212;except for the fact that this paper bag is a steel mesh. The steel mesh is the European Court of Justice and sections 2 and 3 of the European Communities Act. I respect what the Home Secretary is trying to do because she is stuck and trapped in arrangements that are being dictated by the very people&#8212;Mr Juncker, for example, who came forward</p>
	<p pid="c.501.2/3">with these proposals from the European Commission, and Viviane Reding, another European Commissioner of the first order&#8212;who are committed to driving forward these arrangements in the belief that if they could manage to secure a EU-wide criminal justice system, they could make further progress towards the European political union that they want. That is really what it is all about. It is simply na&#239;ve and disingenuous to put it any other way.</p>

The bottom line is that we have now completely reversed our position and are in the process of accepting 35 measures that we would not have contemplated when the Lisbon treaty was going through.</p>
	<p pid="c.502.1/3">Many of the issues that have already been raised and will be raised later during the debate are of deep concern not only to many Conservative Members but, I would say, to many people throughout the country, as the votes in the European elections indicated. I think that this is just another example of our giving in to European measures when there is no real, rational reason for doing so, given that there are criminals&#8212;murderers, traffickers and so forth&#8212;throughout the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid="c.502.1/4">From <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December 2014</phrase>&#8212;the right hon. Member for Delyn mentioned this, but I want to reaffirm it from this side of the House&#8212;the Court of Justice will exercise full jurisdiction over all EU police and criminal justice measures. As a result, the Commission will be able to infract member states&#8212;bring them before the Court, because we have allowed it to do so&#8212;and request a fine if they fail to implement the measures correctly. National courts will be able to seek preliminary rulings from the Court on their interpretation or validity. That is a matter of grave concern to the United Kingdom. The European Scrutiny, Home Affairs and Justice Committees &#8212;the Chairmen of all three are present&#8212;were concerned about the 2014 block opt-out decision, and every one of us, including all the members of my Committee, was critical of the Government&#8217;s reluctance to engage fully with Parliament. All the Committees&#8217; reports are tagged to this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.502.1/5">The history of the issue has not been by any means a happy one. In their response to the reports, the Government stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.502.1/6">&#8220; For the avoidance of doubt, we reaffirm our commitment to hold a second vote in both Houses of Parliament before making a formal application to rejoin any measures. We continue to believe that in order for this vote to be as informed as possible, it should be held after we have reached an &#8216;in principle&#8217; agreement on those measures we will seek to rejoin.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.502.1/7">The problem is that this debate&#8212;a general debate&#8212;is not meeting what we understood would be the case. I remain somewhat surprised that we are engaging in this debate when the timing of and procedure for the real debate have not yet been spelt out. I hope that, when he winds up today&#8217;s debate, the Justice Secretary will give us a clear, factual indication of when that vote and that debate will take place, because that is what the Government have committed themselves to doing.</p>

	<p pid="c.503.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a crucial point. We understood from the Home Secretary that there would be a vote, but we have been given no assurance that there will be a debate prior to that vote. Will my hon. Friend be seeking clarification on that?</p>

	<p pid="c.503.1/1">That is exactly what I have said, and that is exactly what we need to have an answer to. What we do not want is a short debate followed by a vote. We want a comprehensive debate on the Floor of the House of Commons&#8212;no ifs and no buts. I am sure that the Justice Secretary will be able to give us that assurance.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/2">A letter written to me by the Home and Justice Secretaries dated <phrase class="date" code="2014-07-03">3 July</phrase> confirmed that an agreement &#8220;in principle&#8221; had been reached with the Commission on the non-Schengen measures, but not on the overall package. According to the Home Secretary, a number of &#8220;technical reservations&#8221; remained in regard to the Schengen measures, and the General Affairs Council maintained that position the other day. We must have a further, full debate on the Floor of the House, and a vote, once full agreement has been reached.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/3">I want to put a number of questions to the Government. I should be grateful&#8212;as, I think, would the rest of the House&#8212;if the Justice Secretary responded to them when he winds up the debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/4">We need the Government to explain the reasons for the changes to the 35 measures, and to identify which changes demanded by the Commission and the other member states they were able to resist. We want them to clarify whether these are the measures that the Government themselves wish to seek to rejoin, or whether they are measures that they are compelled to rejoin in order to secure a coherent package that is acceptable to the Commission and the other member states. In a nutshell, was this a deal made behind closed doors and conducted to a great extent, if not entirely, by officials, and to what extent does it reflect coalition politics?</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/5">We note that the 35 measures present only part of the picture. We ask the Government to complete the picture by making available to Parliament a list of all the pre-Lisbon measures that were subject to the United Kingdom&#8217;s block opt-out as of <phrase class="date" code="2009-12-01">1 December 2009</phrase>, but no longer are because the UK has opted into amending or &#8220;repeal and replace&#8221; measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/6">We should like the Government to explain why the</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/7">&#8220;solution concerning the Pr&#252;m Decisions and the Probation Framework Decision&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/8">which was alluded to in the Council press release issued after the General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-24">24 June</phrase>, is not mentioned or explained in Command Paper 8897, in the Minister for Europe&#8217;s written ministerial statement of <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-30">30 June</phrase> informing Parliament of the outcome of the Council, or in the letter of <phrase class="date" code="2014-07-03">3 July</phrase> from the Home and Justice Secretaries to me, as Chair of the European Scrutiny Committee. We note that details of the &#8220;solution&#8221; have emerged through press releases and reports and not through the provision of information to Parliament, and we want to know whether the Government regard that as an appropriate way for them to engage with Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/9">We seek further information on the content of the deal that has been made, including any processes for consulting Parliament. We want to know how much the UK has invested so far in its preparations for implementing the Pr&#252;m decisions, and we ask the Minister and the Secretary of State to set out the Government&#8217;s current assessment of the utility of the Pr&#252;m and probation framework decisions.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/10">We want to know about the reliability of some of the assumptions underlying the Government&#8217;s impact assessments, especially in regard to measures such as the prisoner transfer framework decision, when the capacity to operate the measures may be in doubt in some member states, or when the risk of legal challenge on human rights grounds&#8212;based, for example, on article 3 of the European Convention of Human Rights if prison conditions are regarded as inhuman or degrading, or on article 8 if there is interference with the right to respect for family life&#8212;could be regarded as significant.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/11">We note that the possibility of adverse rulings by the Court of Justice does not feature among the &#8220;key assumptions/sensitivities/risks&#8221; in the impact assessments, although concerns about the extension of the Court&#8217;s jurisdiction to EU police and criminal justice measures are at the heart of the block opt-out.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/12">We note that the Government claim to have taken into account the views expressed in our report, as well as those of other Committees. We want to know whether they accept the assessment of our Committee that the selection of measures to rejoin</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/13">&#8220;does not signify any lessening of UK involvement in the key measures governing law enforcement cooperation in the EU&#8221; ,</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/14">our assessment that many of the measures, because of their inherent significance and impact on individuals, are likely to be more susceptible to adverse judgments of the Court of Justice than the numerically larger number of measures that the Government do not propose to rejoin, and our assessment that there is</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/15">&#8220;little evidence of a genuine and significant repatriation of powers&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/16">So we are asking a significant number of questions, and I am putting them on the record now, because we are going to have another debate at a later time. We want to know the significance of the answers to these questions and weigh them up in the light of the general principles I put forward at the beginning, and we need to know about the timing of this debate. We want to know not only when it will take place, but what measures it will cover, as well as receive assurances about the motions that will be tabled. I ask the two Secretaries of State to listen to this very carefully&#8212;they are having</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/17">quite an interesting conversation with one of the Whips at the moment. Would they be good enough to listen carefully? We want to know that the motions will be tabled with sufficient notice to enable Members to prepare amendments, and we reiterate the position on the form of the vote set out in our Committee report: there should be separate motions for each of the measures the Government propose to rejoin.</p>
	<p pid="c.503.1/18">That is an important practical question about that debate, and I believe it is incumbent on the Government to answers the questions this afternoon so we have a clear picture of the way forward and so we know that this debate will not be just a waste of time, given that we have got another debate and another vote to come when all these measures are going to be finally decided. They are critical measures of great importance not only in terms of criminal justice matters, but also in respect of the whole question of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and its rule of law.</p>

	<p pid="c.505.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase>, and as I have not done so previously, may I congratulate him on the knighthood that has been bestowed on him, which was very well deserved, and may I also say how pleased I am to see <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the right hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase> here today, because I understand it is his birthday? What a glorious way to celebrate a birthday, talking about the European arrest warrant and the prisoner transfer agreements!</p>
	<p pid="c.505.0/2">I welcome this debate. As the House has heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase>, the Chairs of the three Select Committees wrote to the Justice Secretary and the Home Secretary asking for an early opportunity to debate these issues, and our letter was received very courteously and we now have a debate as a result of our representations. In the view of the Home Affairs Committee it would have been much better if this debate had taken place before the negotiations began. That was one of the recommendations we made after we took evidence from the Home Secretary and others about these important measures, because we felt strongly that if Parliament had made its views clear before the Home Secretary and Justice Secretary started their negotiations, that mandate would have bolstered them in their negotiations with their European partners. Unfortunately, such a debate did not take place before the negotiations began.</p>
	<p pid="c.505.0/3">I agree with the Chairman of the ESC that there ought to be a vote on this issue. I am glad the Government have said they will have a vote. I would be surprised if there was not a debate before the vote. Even though we are probably only going to have the usual suspects here, I think it should be a long debate, rather than an hour-and-a-half debate, because these are very important measures. What we have asked for&#8212;I will come on to this later when we look at the European arrest warrant&#8212;is a separate vote specifically on the European arrest warrant. The Committee produced a unanimous report, and those who serve on the Home Affairs Committee have different views on the European Union, so getting a unanimous decision on something of this kind is quite</p>
	<p pid="c.505.0/4">difficult. The Committee unanimously decided, however, that we should be asking for this because of the representations we had received from so many people, including hon. and right hon. Members, about the way in which the European arrest warrant operated.</p>
	<p pid="c.505.0/5">We have heard what the Home Secretary has done, and I welcome all the steps she has taken, and also the views of the Opposition Front Bench in Committee when it looked at the way in which the arrest warrant was operating. We heard specific evidence in the Committee from, among others, the hon. Members for Enfield North (Nick de Bois) and for South Dorset (Richard Drax) about individual constituency cases where the European arrest warrant had gone wrong. I and the Committee accept the principle of the European arrest warrant. We believe this was an important measure to enable countries that are members of the European Union&#8212;and, indeed, beyond, through bilateral agreements &#8212;to bring back into the country and offer up those who are wanted in respect of criminal matters. So the principle is fine. However, our concern was the practice, and the examples we received caused us enormous concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.505.0/6">There was the Andrew Symeou case, which was told to us by the hon. Member for Enfield North, and the case of Michael Turner&#8212;a gentleman who was extradited to Hungary and incarcerated there and who never faced any charges and who is a constituent of South Dorset&#8212;and other examples that caused Members to say that the European arrest warrant was good in principle but not necessarily good in practice and had caused their constituents a great deal of concern.</p>
	<p pid="c.505.0/7">As we have heard, the number of requests to our country far exceed the number of requests that we make. The total cost of executing an incoming European arrest warrant in the United Kingdom is approximately &#163;20,000. The 999 received by the United Kingdom in 2011 are estimated to have cost around &#163;20 million. So this is not justice on the cheap. It costs a great deal of money to execute these warrants.</p>
	<p pid="c.505.0/8">Our concern was the way in which they were being requested by certain European countries, and I have mentioned Poland but there were other examples. Indeed, if we look at the requests made of Germany and other countries where people are wanted, we see the figures are just as high. The Home Secretary has great negotiating skills, charm and powers of persuasion, which I saw for myself at the Police Federation conference earlier this year, so she is no pushover, and I am sure she went in there and negotiated strongly on behalf of our country, as Ministers have to do, especially knowing the views of Parliament. The fact is, however, she does not have control, and neither does the Justice Secretary with all his great skills and ability, of the Polish judiciary. They do not have control of the Latvian system of justice. They do not have control of the way in which these warrants are issued in the first place. They do have control over the execution, but not over the issuing.</p>

	<p pid="c.506.0/1">There are some other issues around the European arrest warrant and trying to reform it. While we might want to have reforms that make it function better, is it not the case that the European Commission, in co-decision with the European Parliament, has to have the final say on these matters? So we might want to have this reform, but it</p>
	<p pid="c.506.0/2">might never come forward, and that is a fundamental problem about the opt-in, because we give these powers away completely once and for all.</p>

	<p pid="c.507.0/1">I defer to the knowledge of the hon. Gentleman with all his vast experience of European affairs. Having served as an MEP for so long in the east midlands, he sought asylum here in the House of Commons and he has rightly raised one of the big issues. We can negotiate, but at the end of the day it is an issue that we need to confront. How are we going to persuade the European Commission on these very important matters?</p>
	<p pid="c.507.0/2">We have heard about the wheelbarrow case&#8212;the man accused of stealing a wheelbarrow who was the subject of a European arrest warrant&#8212;and those absconding from prisons on day release or those accused of minor drugs offences. There was a man who gave false details on a &#163;200 bank loan that had already been paid off. A warrant was issued, it had to be executed and that cost &#163;20,000. So the Home Secretary is right to give us the headline examples&#8212;as the shadow Immigration Minister also did&#8212;of people who commit terrible crimes in other parts of Europe and who we feel obliged to give back as quickly as possible, but many, many examples go the other way and that shows there are still problems with the warrant. The Home Secretary has made big efforts to make these matters more effective by introducing the forum bar and giving more powers to the judges to look at such cases, but that is not enough when European partners are not prepared to reform their judicial systems, where so many warrants are being issued.</p>
	<p pid="c.507.0/3">The Home Secretary is often reluctant to tell me about her travel plans after she has been to some of these countries but I am sure that, like me, she has been to Poland. I went there with members of the Committee and we talked to prosecutors there. The first question they asked was, &#8220;Are you coming to talk about the European arrest warrant?&#8221; We said, &#8220;Yes we are, because we are really concerned. Why are the Polish judges issuing so many warrants when, in our view, they are not merited?&#8221; These warrants undermine the principle of the EAW when they are issued for such trivial reasons as the theft of a wheelbarrow. Obviously, it is extremely important for the person who has lost the wheelbarrow, but in the whole history of the world, to coin a phrase of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase>, it is not that important&#8212;it is certainly not worth &#163;20,000. So more work needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.507.0/4">Even when that work is done, the Committee is very clear that we must have a separate vote on the EAW. We are happy to have the package as a whole put before the House. I am not sure how many of these 35 measures can go through the House within a parliamentary day, but we draw a line in the sand about the EAW: Parliament is concerned about it and we therefore need a vote.</p>

	<p pid="c.507.2/1">That is a good point, but luckily, I do not have control of the parliamentary day. These are representations we need to make, and we will see what the will of Parliament is. Let us recall some earlier ministerial words:</p>
	<p pid="c.507.2/2">&#8220;I hope that today I have conveyed to the House not only the Government&#8217;s full commitment to holding a vote on the 2014 decision in this House and the other place, but the importance that we will accord to Parliament in the process leading up to that vote.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-10-15.35"><i>Official Report</i>, 15 October 2012; Vol. 551, c. 35</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.507.2/3">It could be that Members want a vote on each of the 35 measures, but the Committee definitely wants a vote on the EAW, because we think it stands out in the business that the Home Secretary and Justice Secretary are currently discussing in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.507.2/4">I welcome what is being proposed on Europol, and the Committee is a great fan of Rob Wainwright, the British head of Europol, who is doing a terrific job. Anyone who has visited Europol will see the work being done there, which is impressive and effective, and helps in the fight against organised crime. Europol works well with Interpol, although I know comments were made about Interpol. I and others have visited Interpol, which provides a huge benefit to cross-border action against serious and organised crime, illegal migration, people trafficking and all the other issues about which the House is very concerned. At the moment, there are 3,600 internationally active organised crime gangs operating across Europe. We cannot deal with those on our own, especially as far as cyber-crime is concerned; we have to deal with them through Europol. The Home Secretary is right to opt back in to those proceedings. I am not sure about one or two of the other Europol decisions, but if we are going to have further discussions, we will raise those at that stage.</p>

	<p pid="c.508.3/1">Anyone can apply to join the club; we do not mind people wanting to apply to join. The problem is that there are serious issues for all applicant countries to address, and Albania has to recognise that there is a big problem with organised gangs operating from there. A huge amount of work still needs to be done before Albania becomes a full member of the EU, and the hon. Gentleman is right to focus on that. Let me touch on what we must do with applicant countries&#8212;here is a mea culpa, if I am allowed to make one on behalf of the previous Government. Those of us who were enthusiastic about enlargement of the EU&#8212;I still am&#8212;should have realised that once a country has joined we tend to allow it just to continue on its own, without providing the support&#8212;not financial support, but all the other support&#8212;needed to make it a full member of the EU. That is why we need to work with countries throughout this period. We always invite countries to join, but when they are in</p>
	<p pid="c.508.3/2">we leave them on their own, and that is a mistake. There is a lot of work to do on Albania, and I am sure the Albanians understand that and are going to have a lot of help along the way.</p>
	<p pid="c.508.3/3">I am glad that we are opting in to the European criminal records information system, because it allows the courts to make the right decision on those who appear before them. We need to know when dangerous criminals are coming into our country, which is why it is good that we are opting in to that measure. I am sure the Justice Secretary welcomes the prisoner transfer agreement, because he has worked hard to get it going. Two of the top three countries in respect of the 10,695 foreign prisoners we have in our prisons, who are costing us &#163;300 million, are EU countries&#8212;Poland and Ireland. Anything that helps us work with European colleagues to make sure that people go back to their country to serve their sentences is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="c.508.3/4">I welcome the progress that is being made. We must have another debate in Parliament. The process of scrutiny must continue, but at the end of the day there has to be a vote on these measures, as the Government have promised, and specifically on the EAW. That is the strong feeling of every member of the Home Affairs Committee, and I hope I have conveyed that to the House today.</p>

	<p pid="c.509.0/1">First, Madam Deputy Speaker, may I apologise for missing the start of the Home Secretary&#8217;s speech because of a meeting with a Minister which had been arranged before today&#8217;s timings were affected by the earlier statement? I am very glad to follow my colleague the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>. We have worked together, along with the Chair of the European Scrutiny Committee, to try to improve the way Parliament is able to address these matters. It has been a struggle, and the outcome in terms of the process is still far from satisfactory, but we have reached this point and we are having this debate. There will be a debate and a vote or votes at a later stage&#8212;we are still unclear as to what that procedure will be. This has at times been like getting blood out of a stone, and I do not think that is particularly in the Government&#8217;s interests. I appreciate some of the problems that they face, but in order to obtain parliamentary support they need to give Parliament the opportunities to feel confident that it has been able to examine things properly. I am therefore glad that we now have the Command Paper, which includes all the impact assessments. It would have been very helpful to have had those much earlier, and of course we still do not have the impact assessments on those measures the Government do not propose to enter&#8212;perhaps those would have helped to illuminate the Government&#8217;s reasons for the decisions they made.</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/2">There are no changes in the opt-ins in the Ministry of Justice field; the changes are in the much larger number of measures that come within the Home Office&#8217;s sphere. The Justice Committee has therefore already examined and reached conclusions on the measures, and it is unlikely to do a great deal more on the issue between</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/3">now and the later stages of consideration. We published a report, and the Government are still pursuing a view with which we broadly agree, and I will explain why.</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/4">The measures include six mutual recognition measures, including one on financial penalties that originated with the United Kingdom and Sweden. There are measures on previous convictions, prisoner transfers, judgments in absentia and European supervision orders. The Government propose to rejoin all those measures with one exception, which is the probation measures framework decision, to which I will return. The Committee agrees that the Government were right, in the national interest and in the interest of effective cross-border co-operation, to seek to rejoin five of the measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/5">The Committee of course strongly supports the UK&#8217;s participation in the prisoner transfer framework decision because it is a priority to reduce the number of foreign nationals held in UK prisons. That decision is also an important part of the overall package for reforming the European arrest warrant. The Committee is particularly conscious of the problems presented by the large number of foreign nationals in UK prisons. Those are nationals from many countries in UK prisons, and the Government must continue their efforts in relation to those countries. With European countries, however, there is a much better prospect of achieving a prisoner&#8217;s return to their native country because we are not dealing with countries in which human rights considerations, on the face of it, would appear to prevent a return.</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/6">One of the five measures, the European supervision order, enables a defendant or suspect on non-custodial pre-trial bail or other supervision to return to their home member state to await trial there under supervision, and we support and welcome that measure. The probation measures framework decision provides the basis for mutual recognition and supervision of suspended sentences, post-custodial licences and community sentences, and the Committee noted the Government&#8217;s concerns about the measure&#8217;s operation:</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/7">&#8220;In view of the potential value of the Framework Decision we consider that the Government should pursue the matter in their negotiations on the opt-in list to see whether these concerns can be dealt with. We would not wish to rule out participation in the measure if concerns about its drafting can be overcome&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/8">We discovered from another source that a solution to that problem is alleged to have been found. The source was a press release issued by the General Affairs Council on <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-24">24 June</phrase>, from which it appears that the Government have undertaken to consider opting back in to two Pr&#252;m decisions and the probation measures framework decision at a later stage.</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/9">In evidence to our Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2014-07-09">9 July</phrase>, the Lord Chancellor admitted that he had been pressed by the Commission to rejoin the probation measures framework decision, arguing that it was closely linked to the prisoner transfer agreement. He repeated the objections that he had previously expressed to the Committee, particularly that we do not have much experience of the measure&#8217;s operation in other countries and the legal problems that it might cause. He said that the solution reached in the negotiations was that the UK would look at the matter again in the next Parliament to see whether rejoining would be in the national interest. It would have been preferable if the Government had volunteered information on that, either in correspondence or in a Command</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/10">Paper, instead of leaving it to Committees to glean information from Council press releases and media reports.</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/11">More generally, the Justice Committee supports the Government&#8217;s choice of measures to rejoin in the national interest and in the interest of fighting crime. We reached some agreement with the Government on minimum standards measures that set standards already met by the United Kingdom. We said that</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/12">&#8220;the arguments for opting into the&#8230;minimum standards measures are primarily symbolic, and our view is that those arguments do not outweigh the disadvantages of bringing wide areas of criminal justice in the UK unnecessarily into the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/13">Many traditions in our judicial systems in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are different from those that prevail in continental practice, and it therefore makes sense not to become involved in matters in the European Court of Justice when doing so does not serve the national interest. There is value in signing up to minimum standards measures if it has a persuasive effect in other countries, but the Committee&#8217;s view is that that is outweighed by the disadvantages of creating case law in the European Court of Justice on matters that do not need to be treated in that way.</p>
	<p pid="c.509.0/14">The changes to the list of 35 measures do not appear to affect the overall balance of the package. Some of the changes are the consequence of measures ceasing to be subject to the block opt-out, and others, such as the additional measures on Europol and the Schengen information system, are ancillary to the Government&#8217;s decision to participate in Europol and the Schengen information system and may be regarded as necessary on the grounds of coherence and practical operability. It is interesting that the Government have achieved the conjuring trick of changing the list of measures while retaining the same total number. I suspect that has something to do with internal party management within the Conservative party, but the outcome for the balance of the measures will continue to be supported by the Committee. The measures that the Government have agreed to opt into will materially assist in the fight against serious crime and in the safeguarding of the freedom of our citizens. The Government have my support.</p>

	<p pid="c.511.0/1">As could be imagined, tailgating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase> on these issues in the European Scrutiny Committee on behalf of the Labour party is a tortuous but enlightening process. It is interesting to note that the original Command Paper 8671, which was published in July 2013 and which we discussed on the Floor of the House, has been slightly amended. Most people probably do not realise that what we are discussing now is a similar, but not identical, list of 35 measures set out in Command Paper 8897 on <phrase class="date" code="2014-07-03">3 July 2014</phrase>, so there have been some small amendments along the way.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/2">I recommend that interested people outside the House not only listen to the debates, which are enlightening but repetitive, but read the relevant documents from the European Scrutiny Committee, the Justice Committee and the Home Affairs Committee. Those documents give a flavour of the minutiae about which the European Scrutiny Committee in general differs from the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/3">Although I have my concerns about the European Union, and particularly about the behaviour of the Commission, I am not a conspiracy theorist. I do not support the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s often-repeated analysis that it has been set out in a dark room somewhere in the European Commission that this will all eventually lead to a united states of Europe controlled by a bureaucracy in Brussels that is helped by the European Court of Justice and many other manipulative organs of the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/4">The fact is that the European Commission, at its heart, tends to have a competence creep mentality. In many areas the Commission is making everyone do things according to its will when those things do not require such direction. I am a great supporter of devolution in Scotland and other parts of the UK, and I am a great supporter of subsidiarity, but not the subsidiarity set out in the Lisbon treaty. It is a falsehood to say that the Lisbon treaty has given more power to Parliaments.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/5">In that sense, I wonder about the Government&#8217;s approach to the opt-outs that we are debating. We know there is a block opt-out on all 133 measures, most of which, as has been articulately stated by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase>, have been superseded or are redundant. On a few issues, we might want to argue about the final details of whether we should have opted in to certain justice standards, but at the heart of the debate is a feeling that the Government have not been willing to be open enough about that fact, which was a point raised by the Chair of the Justice Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>. The reality is that there have been no massively significant changes to the competences that have been drawn back to the UK, because most of the 133 measures have been superseded, are redundant or have never been used. Therefore, the myth being created, which is that this process is about repatriating powers to the UK&#8212;one that has been put forward by the Government&#8212;is such an obvious falsehood that the public are becoming more and more disillusioned and sceptical about the Government&#8217;s position.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/6">I think that the majority of the coalition Government are pro-EU and want to see us solidly at the heart of the EU and influencing it. I think that they are deeply committed, as I think we on the Opposition side are, to reforming the EU, making it more relevant and finding a way to draw back to the member states the powers that they wish to apply in their own right. But that is not what people are seeing in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/7">For example, the Justice Committee reached the conclusion&#8212;on page 6 of its eighth report of the 2013-14 Session&#8212;that in the previous debate the House was not being asked at that stage to endorse the list of 35 measures that the Government intended to opt back into, but the Home Secretary used the debate again and again to claim that the Government had the support of the House of Commons for what they were doing. She gave the impression again and again, in writing and in the spoken word, that that is what we did. We started a process and considered a Command Paper, but we did not conclude that it was correct or endorse it; the public were given the impression that somehow we had.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/8">The position taken by the Chair of the European Scrutiny Committee is supported by its members&#8212;certainly the 13 who were there, including myself. We think that the House should debate and vote on each of the 35 measures&#8212;I saw you flinch, Madam Deputy Speaker,</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/9">when that was suggested. They might be all in the same order and, as the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee pointed out, there are key issues, so it might be possible to group them in such a way that Members can express their opinions by voting on groups.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/10">However, I certainly agree that we should have some kind of debate&#8212;it is a pity that it is being done in this context&#8212;about the European arrest warrant, because I think that it is the right kind of measure. We would not want to replace it with a country-by-country arrangement based on applications to bring people back individually. I will give an example. I hope that my friend&#8212;and I do regard him as a friend&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> is listening. After the <phrase class="date" code="2014-07-07">7 July</phrase> bombings, the fact that we could return one of the bombers to this country within three weeks was a massive example of why such an arrangement is fundamentally sound. However, it might have to be modified in some ways to stop the nonsense of having applications for cases of wheelbarrow theft or &#163;200 loans with the wrong details and all sorts of trivia.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/11">I want to expand on a case from my constituency. It concerns a family with a custody order over a child. The father, who is Polish, abducted the child and took it to Poland, so the grandfather and a friend went to Poland, took the child and brought it back to Scotland. The father then claimed that he had been assaulted during that process. A European arrest warrant was sought and the case was taken to a Scottish court, but it ruled that the warrant was not valid because the witness was clear that no assault had taken place and that what they had done was to apply the court&#8217;s ruling that the mother, who is Scottish, had the right to custody of the child and that the father had abducted the child. That seemed to be the end of the matter, and it sounded sensible to me. However, something went wrong with the process. Only last year the grandfather, who is now not in good health, and his wife decided to take a holiday in the Netherlands. When he stepped off the plane in Amsterdam, he was arrested and sent to Poland. He had a heart attack there and ended up in hospital. When the court in Poland eventually looked at the case, it concluded that there was no case to answer and that the European arrest warrant was not valid, so he was released. Now his health is even worse.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/12">Why is there no process&#8212;I have asked the Home Secretary this&#8212;whereby all the agencies that sign up to the European arrest warrant can be informed when a court rules against an attempt to use it in the country in which it is attempted to be served? Why is there no transmission of that information? The grandfather could have gone on holiday anyway in the EU and he would probably have been arrested and sent to Poland, and for a European arrest warrant that a court had already ruled was invalid. It makes no sense to me that these things still stand. Apart from the trivia, it is the mechanism of how they are applied that worries me.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/13">The basic fact of this debate is that the European Scrutiny Committee, the Home Affairs Committee and the Justice Committee felt that the Government were not giving enough information and that they were not willing to accept that it is not enough to bring back one blockbuster motion stating, &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a negotiation and signed up to 35 items. Take it or leave it.&#8221; It cannot</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/14">be done like that. If it is done like that, it will undermine the Government&#8217;s credibility. The Opposition would then be in a difficult situation, because we would have to either support the motion, if it was all that was available, table a counter-motion of some kind in order to divide up the 35 items, or use some other process in order to respond to what the British public, Parliament and the three Committees want, which is a debate on the fundamental issues in the package so that we can vote on them individually and say, as I hope we will, &#8220;Yes, we are behind this move to sign up to the 35 items.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/15">Some of us might like to see some other things opted into, with a little bit of finessing by the Government so that we keep progressing along the path that I think we are on with justice and home affairs. My worry is not about justice and home affairs and a corpus juris for Europe; my worry is with the economics of the European Union that are destroying the economies of the subservient countries that have come into it and are under the fiscal compact and the eurozone&#8217;s stability and growth pact. That, to me, is what is damaging the project for Europe, not justice and home affairs. I am not worried about the fact&#8212;this was put to me in a private conversation with another hon. Member&#8212;that the Queen has to register and prove that she is a real British citizen so that her bank account can be used across Europe. What worries me is that we are damaging other people in Europe for the power of the economic giants, including us&#8212;we are a much-diminished giant, but we are still benefiting from it. I want the debate to take place in such a way that people can say afterwards that there is a united feeling in this House that the European Union is a good thing.</p>
	<p pid="c.511.0/16">I will also put down a marker for those on my Front Bench. I want to see us sign up to a referendum on the European Union and to go out with like-minded people across the House and win a yes vote to remain in the European Union and build Europe for the benefit of British citizens.</p>

	<p pid="c.514.0/1">I have been in this House for seven Parliaments. Each has seemed to have a different character, but there has been one consistent thread across all that time: the integration within European processes. That has had support on high days, on holidays and in opposition. I see it as a fundamental task of the House of Commons to challenge perceived wisdoms and reflect the responsibilities and interests of those we are elected to represent.</p>
	<p pid="c.514.0/2">I have also seen the continuing theme of membership of the European Union over all that time. It has never quite been a settled issue. For all the trumpets and bands, all the songs and the universal praise, there is a deep underlying tug. It is really about a sense of country. Who are we? It has always been about that. That, after all, is the first duty of a sovereign state, I would argue: to protect the interests, freedoms and liberties that we have enjoyed under our form of constitutional arrangements. What we are really seeing is a struggle over the British constitution. Oh, but does it not evolve over time? Yet, looking back, there has been one constant theme, which is that people profoundly believed in many of the central precepts of what constitutes a sovereign state. I am driven in my memory by certain</p>
	<p pid="c.514.0/3">observations, too. The German constitutional court made the observation that democracy lies not in the institutions of the community, the European Union, but in the national state, and yet everything that this House seems to do in recent years is to surrender and denigrate that nation state&#8212;the very concept by which we have authority in this House.</p>
	<p pid="c.514.0/4">What is the criticism of the European arrest warrant? It is that it is promoted on the basis of a benefit, but to many people it is actually a degradation of the security of the British people. The fact that they can be taken away from within this jurisdiction by almost a mandate, which will, in time, be governed by the European Court of Justice is a loss of the authority of our own legal and justice system.</p>
	<p pid="c.514.0/5">The House is well aware that, in recent months, a series of High Court and Supreme Court judges have been writing essays, making a plea about the way in which the discretion and the interpretation of human rights is conducted. The most central purpose of a Government is law and order and the effectiveness with which they protect the citizen, and no one can dispute that our Home Secretary is fierce in her determination to protect the British citizen. But, actually, the greatest protection of a citizen and a coherent society, which is what we call the sovereign state, lies within the commitment of the people to their institutions and their way of self-government, and that is what this measure undermines.</p>

	<p pid="c.515.1/1">I will not trade remarks on this matter. I was also born in Scotland, and I am deprived of a vote on something that affects my cousins and my relatives. This has been a Union for 300 years, and we have been united by the sentiments of those people. Not so very long ago&#8212;70 years&#8212;the Scots, the English, the Welsh and those from Northern Ireland stood together against the greatest danger of our time: the monolithic power of Germany. I see this not as nationalistic but as a reflection and a pride in who we are, what we are, what this nation has accomplished and our ability to govern ourselves. The Scots will make their own decision; I am not involved in that because I do not have a residence in Scotland. Anyone passing through who might temporarily have a residence there can have a vote. No, no that is not democratic, and it is not the spirit of the Union. The Union has fought together, worked together and made something together, and that is the Union I am concerned about, not the European Union. When we come to deal with these matters, we will find that we have surrendered our very sense of &#8220;these are our people.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.515.1/2">As a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, we looked at these extradition orders. The Home Affairs Committee and the Justice Committee have looked at these matters, too. No one has made any mention of this, but one of the best things in the process were the groups that have spoken and given testimony to those Committees. The Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee talked about those who are genuinely concerned about the way in which all of this has happened.</p>
	<p pid="c.515.1/3">I half expected to hear mention of the Staffordshire case in Genoa in which a man, under these extradition endeavours, was found guilty of murder, although he had never been there or even near there. No, the integrity of a nation is founded on its institutions and also the law. In this country, I maintain that we have a pretty high degree of acceptance of the process of law and judgment and the way in which it is made. What we are now confronted with is the triviality of a central bureaucracy that sets out to be a great state, which I know <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40369" name="Michael Connarty">the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> for honourable reasons passionately believes in, but who in the end will protect us? That can only be the people of our own country and our own institutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.515.1/4">I find no comfort in this succession of cases, which have been listed by the Chair of the Home Affairs Committee, and which the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk also knows well enough about. We have all had constituents who have expressed a concern that the British Government&#8212;Parliament&#8212;seem to have no effectiveness in the world. I do not blame anyone for that. It is a crisis in our nation that we have to question who really governs us. I maintain that it is us who should govern us, and by that I mean our own Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.515.1/5">I was deeply distressed when I heard the words of the Home Secretary, who fiercely defends us, in impossible cases, against treaty after treaty into which British Governments have entered. I even consider the United States treaty on extradition to be grotesquely misjudged. Of course the wonderful thing is that there will always be a judge who will find good merit in whatever the British Government are proposing. I will take issue, because my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, who is undoubtedly a doughty, valiant and fierce fighter, has achieved very little in the face of these international organisations that we have so joyously, easily and with great hallelujahs joined, and yet those organisations all sting us, because in the end they have taken away from the very sovereignty of our people. When we talk about the sovereignty of Parliament, we mean the people, and ultimately all of our fates are decided by them. In our grotesque shifting away from the authority of the people, we lose them, and that is why there is such a great disconnect.</p>
	<p pid="c.515.1/6">I am glad to see that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40253" name="Dominic Raab">the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab)</phrase> is in his place. He has catalogued many of these cases and understands their interconnectivity with what has happened. This is a bound Parliament now. It is bound not by the people but by our own passing views of the great affairs of the world. I fear that we have lost our nerve in some way. I watched a celebration of the end of war in Europe 70 years ago, and I saw elderly people, who had lost friends and colleagues, showing such pride that even alone Britain could stand for something; and we do stand for something. It does not need the buying of votes or the passing over of great sums of money. I listened with alarm that Albania will be &#8220;brought up&#8221;. This is a union that has been founded on the transfer of payments. Now, I believe, and my dad taught me, that we earn our own living. That is the truth that this country seems to be waving away. We pass over money in vast sums. I wonder why we are giving &#163;9 billion net a year to fund European integration. We watched Ireland&#8212;I feel tremendously for Ireland&#8212;which had a near transfer of 5% of GDP to support the move to the future. It did</p>
	<p pid="c.515.1/7">that on its own, and the way it has come through the crisis has been an amazing feat of self-discipline and obedience to European precepts.</p>
	<p pid="c.515.1/8">So we come to the substance of the debate. We are giving over to others the ultimate rule on the protection of our own citizens. This will come under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which most people would agree is an integrationist court, governed by the central proposition of ever-closer union. I think of the glory of Europe historically&#8212;the nation states of Europe, the cultures, the universities, the interconnectivity, but not the throttling blanket that the European Union now represents to many of us.</p>
	<p pid="c.515.1/9">Many people knock us and say, &#8220;But wasn&#8217;t there something we could have done?&#8221; We had a constitution that never doubted who was in charge&#8212;the people. We have transferred that role to international friction-making devices such as the European Union. We should be seen by our people as defending the interests of the people. I have always been cautious about a declaration from the Front Bench&#8212;any Front Bench&#8212;that says, &#8220;We act in the national interest.&#8221; The national interest is what this House decides, and ultimately what the people decide.</p>
	<p pid="c.515.1/10">The whole course of the European project has been to avoid any engagement with the people over what is a non-democratic and largely unsuccessful Union, other than for the transfer of vast sums of money. We have to do something about that, and these opt-ins, opt-outs, see-all-round-abouts amount, in the end, to what the Government disguise and pretend is not really happening, as if it were a grand scheme. I have lost all confidence in understanding what central Government or the Foreign Office do these days, other than remaining quiet.</p>

	<p pid="c.517.0/1">It is always a pleasure to follow a brother knight. I take this opportunity to echo the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> in congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase> on becoming a brother knight. The whole House should congratulate you, Madam Deputy Speaker, on having become a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, an order of chivalry considerably more senior than that of we mere Knights Bachelor. I can think of no better way of spending my birthday than in group therapy with brother knights, my hon. Friends the Members for Stone, for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh), for Aldridge-Brownhills (Sir Richard Shepherd), for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth) and for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), so it has been a good debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.517.0/2">The issue before us is what is in the national interest, what is in the interests of our constituents, and what will make us safe. In that regard I thought it might be helpful to ask Thames Valley police what they thought about the European arrest warrant. I have rather a high respect for Thames Valley police. I have lived in the Thames valley pretty much all my life and those of us who are Members of Parliament for constituencies in the Thames valley are rather proud of Thames Valley police. They directed me to evidence on the European arrest warrant that was submitted to the House of</p>
	<p pid="c.517.0/3">Lords in 2012 on behalf of the Association of Chief Police Officers. ACPO consulted chief constables and police authorities around the country. It was seeking to give advice to the House of Lords on which parts of the opt-out should be opted back into, and it recommended above all else that the European arrest warrant be opted back into under the same arrangements as were then in place.</p>

	<p pid="c.518.1/1">I should have thought that, on a matter of law and order, even my hon. Friend would think it might just be sensible to take the advice of police forces up and down the country. Whatever we do in the House ought to be evidence-based, and I should have thought the evidence from police authorities and police forces around the country might be rather cogent and sensible evidence in these circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="c.518.1/2">The ACPO assessment confirmed that the European arrest warrant is the most important of all the measures in the area of justice and home affairs. Most of the police forces and chief officers&#8212;I am sure that if my hon. Friend, for example, were to ask the chief constable of Essex and the Essex police force, they would make this point to him as well&#8212;believe that opting out of the European arrest warrant and relying on alternative arrangements would result in fewer extraditions, longer delays, higher costs, more offenders evading justice, and increased risks to public safety. They went on to say that the European arrest warrant</p>
	<p pid="c.518.1/3">&#8220;has been in operation for eight years and has now become a mainstream tool. . . In 2010/11 the UK received 5,382 EAW requests and made 221 EAW requests to other EU states. The UK surrendered 1,149 individuals (approximately 7% of which were UK nationals, the other 93% being fugitives to the UK).The UK had 93 people surrendered to it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.518.1/4">ACPO observed:</p>
	<p pid="c.518.1/5">&#8220;These trends in extradition reflect the increasing international patterns of crime and offending. Open borders across Europe, free movement of EU citizens, low cost air travel, cheap telecommunications, the internet and the expansion of criminal networks across national boundaries are all contributory factors to the growth in extradition requests. These are irreversible changes which need to be matched by increasing flexibility on the part of European law enforcement and criminal justice agencies.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.518.1/6">ACPO went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="c.518.1/7">&#8220;Further evidence of these changes is to be found in data concerning arrests. Recent data gathered by the MPS&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.518.1/8">the Metropolitan police service&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.518.1/9">&#8220;in the first quarter of 2012 showed that of 61,939 people arrested in London, 8,089 were nationals from EU countries (13%) and 9,358 were foreign nationals from outside the EU (15%). The presence of fugitives from justice fleeing to the UK is a significant public safety issue. In 2011/12 the MPS received 50 EAWs for homicide, 20 for rape, and 90 for robbery. Each of these cases represents a person who is wanted for a serious crime who fled to the UK. There is strong evidence to show that foreign criminals who come to UK continue to offend when in the UK. There is a real risk that opting out of the EAW and relying on less effective extradition arrangements could have the effect of turning the UK into a &#8216;safe haven&#8217; for Europe&#8217;s criminals.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.518.2/1">I am listening intently to what my right hon. Friend is saying. We should listen to ACPO, but I do not think that in its</p>
	<p pid="c.518.2/2">evidence to the House of Lords Committee ACPO made the argument that he is making in his speech. In respect of fugitives coming to the UK, there is no reason, in or out of the European arrest warrant, why we cannot just deport them. Deportation powers would provide a much quicker route even than extradition under the European arrest warrant. The wider question is whether we could get people back. That is an important point, but ACPO&#8217;s evidence focused on the latter, not the former.</p>

	<p pid="c.519.0/1">I am quoting verbatim from ACPO&#8217;s evidence given to the House of Lords. I will share it with my hon. Friend afterwards, but it is verbatim, so I am afraid that he has misdirected himself or misremembered the evidence that ACPO submitted. I am pretty old and gnarled but I can remember from when I practised at the Bar as a prosecutor that it was a nightmare to return foreign offenders overseas using bilateral agreements&#8212;it could sometimes take years with multiple applications. I recall application after application at Horseferry road magistrates court as we ploughed through various procedural points to get people deported.</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/2">I go on to quote verbatim, so there is no possibility of misunderstanding for my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40253" name="Dominic Raab">the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab)</phrase>, from ACPO&#8217;s evidence to the House of Lords. It says that the European arrest warrant is</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/3">&#8220;an efficient system, built upon mutual recognition of criminal justice systems between member states and an obligation to comply with a properly constructed warrant. Barriers which previously existed have been removed. The nationality of the person sought can no longer be a barrier to affecting an extradition request. Under the previous arrangements many European states, such as Germany, France and Poland, did not allow their nationals to be extradited to stand trial and required them to be tried in their home state&#8230;Prior to the introduction of the EAW, extradition between European states where it did occur could, and often would, take many months in uncontested cases and many years in contested cases.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/4">I can testify to that, having been involved in some of those cases. The evidence continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/5">&#8220;EAW data from the Commission to the European Parliament show that across the EU it takes an average of 17 days to surrender a wanted person&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/6">Thames Valley police gave me just two very recent examples in which the European arrest warrant had made my constituents safer. Under a recent European arrest warrant, they arrested a Polish individual wanted for armed robbery and burglary in Poland, clearly safeguarding the local community as the Thames Valley police had no intelligence that there were individuals residing in our area who had been assessed as high risk. The warrant was received, processed and executed within 24 hours, removing a potential offender and providing reassurance to the community. Another individual wanted for taking part in the murder of two youths in Milton Keynes was also arrested in Holland under a European arrest warrant. He The European crime unit extradited him to the UK, where he now awaits trial, and two other suspects were sentenced in an earlier trial to more than 30 years&#8217; imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/7">It is said by some, including my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton, that we should rely on deportation and other extradition proceedings, but we need only contrast the speed of those cases with what happened with Abu Hamza. Fourteen years after his</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/8">arrest on behalf of the USA under legal conditions largely identical to the 1957 treaty, he was finally extradited to the USA to face terrorism charges there. Do we really want to see repeated Abu Hamza-type situations in our extradition processes? These are not isolated examples of where the European arrest warrant has been of benefit. Numerous other examples could be cited.</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/9">The European arrest warrant is cost-efficient. If we relied on a 1957-type mechanism we would commit ourselves to footing the legal bill for extradition processes that went on for years and cost the public purse hundreds of thousands of pounds. The public and the judiciary are frustrated that the extradition of terrorists is often delayed for years. The return to the 1957 process could make this long, drawn-out process the norm. That might not have been such a problem 20 or 30 years ago when criminals rarely crossed borders, but nowadays that is routine.</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/10">ACPO concluded in its evidence to the House of Lords and Parliament:</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/11">&#8220;The view therefore of ACPO is simple. The EAW works very effectively and increases the safety of the UK public. It is for this reason that ACPO strongly supports the EAW.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/12">I hope that before we next debate and vote on this issue in the House, chief constables and police authorities will write to every right hon. and hon. Member making clear the position of local police forces and drawing Members&#8217; attention to the benefits that the European arrest warrant has had in their own areas.</p>
	<p pid="c.519.0/13">I fully appreciate that Members of this House oppose anything that has the word &#8220;Europe&#8221; in it. I genuinely love my hon. Friend the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills, but I have heard that speech now about 50 times during the 30 years for which I have been a Member of this House. The fact that one is opposed to the European Union is not sufficient to jeopardise the safety of our constituents or our national interest. The Home Secretary, by opting back into a number of these measures, particularly the European arrest warrant, is, in my view and judgment, doing something sensible, proportionate, in the national interest and, most importantly of all, in the interests of my constituents.</p>

	<p pid="c.520.0/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to follow my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase>. The burden of his case appears to be that the efficacy of any extradition arrangements should override any other balanced argument about what might be affected by them. He demonstrates how easy it is to be seduced by expediency, convenience, efficiency and pressure from the police, who have only one objective, and that is not to create more of the stronger human rights or protections for citizens that they feel obstruct their task of creating law and order. That is why this House does not abdicate decisions on matters of constitutional importance or human rights to ACPO.</p>
	<p pid="c.520.0/2">The Abu Hamza case took so long because we had lost control of our law and because we no longer control the human rights jurisprudence in our courts. The lesson of that case is precisely the opposite of what my right hon. Friend suggests. We should take control of our own laws by enacting laws from this place rather than abdicating authority to other places, least of all to foreign powers.</p>
	<p pid="c.520.0/3">I was struck in this debate by how my right hon. Friend wanted to caricature the objections to the provisions, saying that anybody who is obsessed with the issue of Europe will stand up and object to anything. I am a trustee of the Parliament choir and last night we sang alongside our German counterparts, the Bundestag choir, in Westminster Hall. I stood shoulder to shoulder with a fellow bass from Germany and that is the kind of unity, brotherhood and friendship with our European partners that we want to demonstrate. It should be possible to discuss the practical arrangements we have with each other without being impugned as some kind of right-wing xenophobe, but I am afraid that my right hon. Friend fell into that trap.</p>
	<p pid="c.520.0/4">Another striking point about this debate is that although the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, the former Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40369" name="Michael Connarty">the hon. Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase>, and the Chairman of the Justice Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>, each expressed support in principle, they were a great deal more chary about the consequences and effects of signing up to these arrangements than either of the Front-Bench speakers.</p>
	<p pid="c.520.0/5">I take on board what my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary said about the additional protections that she thinks she has obtained for the exercise of the European arrest warrant, whereby we now have domestic legislation in place to deal with matters of disproportionality and dual criminality. That goes to the heart of the wider context of this debate as to whether we really control the terms of engagement that we are entering into with this instrument and whether this House has any control over the terms of engagement that our law has with our membership of the European Community.</p>
	<p pid="c.520.0/6">This debate exposes the dislocation between the words of our political leaders and their actions. What we are discussing today feeds the discontent and disillusion that people feel about our politics and politicians and about the UK&#8217;s relationship with our EU partners. We have seen across the House the same old cosy consensus between those on both Front Benches that encouraged UKIP to such new heights in the recent European elections.</p>
	<p pid="c.520.0/7">The very title of the debate, which says that it is a general debate on the UK&#8217;s justice and home affairs opt-outs, is misleading. The UK has already exercised our opt-outs from the justice and home affairs provisions under the Lisbon treaty. This debate is about whether the Government should opt back in to 35 of these measures. Unlike what was agreed&#8212;it pains me to say this&#8212;about these provisions at Lisbon by the previous Government, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is proposing a major and permanent transfer of power from the UK to the EU: a transfer of more sovereignty which, nevertheless, escapes a referendum under the European Union Act. This is yet another example of politicians seeking to provide reassurance to voters without actually meaning it. The transfer includes a permanent commitment to the notorious European arrest warrant, which is intended to remove the recourse of a citizen of the UK to the courts in the event of such</p>
	<p pid="c.520.0/8">a warrant, whatever UK legislation is place, with the new provisions themselves vulnerable to being overridden by the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="c.520.0/9">The idea that any extradition arrangement we enter into with other EU states would necessarily be subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice is, in itself, an admission of how overreaching the European treaties have become. There are still parts of our law that are immune from the reach of the European Court of Justice. It should be possible to reach an agreement with the European Union that the European Court of Justice will not arbitrate in disputes between the United Kingdom courts and the European courts in such matters. The fact that there is an assumption that the European Court of Justice will preside over any dispute between the United Kingdom and the EU on any matter demonstrates how overarching the reach of the Court under these treaties already is. That goes to the heart of what we are tangentially discussing, which is the future of the UK&#8217;s relationship with our European partners.</p>

	<p pid="c.522.0/1">I agree with everything my hon. Friend is saying. In the United Kingdom, as compared with all the other 27 member states, we are in a unique position. Our European Communities Act is a voluntary Act. We do not have a written constitution. We are able to make the changes that are necessary to regain our sovereignty. When the Prime Minister says that our national Parliaments are the root of our democracy, he knows, and so do the Government, that we still retain the right to be able to make the changes in order to extract ourselves from situations that we regard as not being in our national interest.</p>

	<p pid="c.522.1/1">I agree with the Prime Minister and with my hon. Friend on that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/2">The Prime Minister recently told the &#8220;Today&#8221; programme that he wants to pursue a relationship with our European partners based on &#8220;trade and co-operation&#8221; and on being &#8220;an independent nation state&#8221;. I have to say that I cannot find any strand of consistency between the measures in this Command Paper and the aspirations expressed by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/3">May I remind my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, who is not in her place at the moment, of what we said in the House about the European arrest warrant when we were in opposition? My right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary, as shadow Home Secretary, said in 2009 that it &#8220;undermined civil liberties&#8221;. My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General, as shadow Justice Secretary, said in 2008 that</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/4">&#8220;once such things are subject to the European Court of Justice and the Commission&#8230;the Government will lose all control over standing up for United Kingdom interests in these areas&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-01-29.176"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 January 2008; Vol. 471, c. 176</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/5">He also pointed out that the European arrest warrant</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/6">&#8220;is very different from&#8230;an international treaty obligation that the United Kingdom could decide not to follow if it infringed the human rights of those affected. We will be surrendering the final say about that entirely to a supranational body.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-01-29.175"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 January 2008; Vol. 471, c. 175</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/7">The Foreign Secretary, as shadow Foreign Secretary, chided the previous Government for not keeping their promises on the EU when he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/8">&#8220;Time and again they have made promises that they would not hand over powers to Europe, particularly on justice and home affairs, and time and again they have done exactly that, not least through the treaty.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2008-03-04.1684"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 March 2008; Vol. 472, c. 1684</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/9">My right hon. Friend now has to eat those words.</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/10">The Conservative party manifesto of 2010 promised</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/11">&#8220;three specific guarantees&#8212;on the Charter of fundamental rights, on criminal justice, and on social and employment legislation&#8212;with our European partners to return powers that we believe should reside with the UK, not the EU.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/12">Why have we abandoned that? It was based on a speech the Prime Minister made when in opposition, in which he promised to negotiate the three guarantees, one of which was</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/13">&#8220;limiting the European Court of Justice&#8217;s jurisdiction over criminal law to its pre-Lisbon level, and ensuring that only British authorities can initiate criminal investigations in Britain.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/14">Why have we abandoned that?</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/15">Much more recently, the Prime Minister wrote in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-16">16 March 2014</phrase> that one of the key changes he would seek in a renegotiation with the EU was:</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/16">&#8220;Our police forces and justice systems able to protect British citizens, unencumbered by unnecessary interference from the European institutions&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/17">Why have we abandoned that already? What did he intend to convey to voters in advance of the European elections? Surely not that he intended to do exactly the opposite a few weeks after the close of poll.</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/18">This year&#8217;s Conservative European election leaflet stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/19">&#8220;We stand for a new relationship with the EU, bringing power back to Britain and away from Brussels&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/20">by, among other things,</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/21">&#8220;taking back control of justice and home affairs&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/22">If the UK intends to bring powers back in our renegotiation after the next election, it is a strange way for the Prime Minister to begin setting out his stall by giving up the very powers he said he would not give up.</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/23">That raises the question about the pressure on Ministers to continue supporting the process of EU integration because of coalition politics. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary&#8217;s blank denial that there could be any alternative to the European arrest warrant underlines that she may well have fallen prey to such pressures. Notwithstanding the fact that the main party in power has a different policy and was elected having opposed Nice, Amsterdam and Lisbon, Whitehall appears to be continuing to implement those treaties according to a policy of business as usual. More powers are being transferred from the UK to the EU, with EU legislation encroaching ever more on our justice system, as though there had been no change of Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/24">I do not doubt that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is acting on advice and with complete integrity, but it may help if I, as Chairman of the Public Administration Committee, remind the House how advice to Ministers works in a coalition. The civil service is enjoined to serve the Government as a whole, not individual party agendas or the different agendas of individual Ministers. It comes as no surprise, therefore, that no serious consideration has been given to any</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/25">alternative policy of negotiating a permanent bilateral agreement on these matters, like the 170 or so sovereign states that are not members of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.522.1/26">If my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary had been minded to ask for credible submissions to support such a policy and then to act on them, it is not only the status quo in her Department, the Foreign Office and elsewhere that she would have had to fight. She would certainly have had the support of the Conservatives in that&#8212;if we were a majority Government, I doubt she would have had the support to act in the way she is acting now&#8212;but in this coalition, the quad would have vetoed that policy. It is, therefore, hardly surprising, four years since her appointment, that little work has been done on any alternative policy.</p>

	<p pid="c.524.0/1">I think it is terribly important that we explain to the public what the quad is about, because it is Westminster-speak and I do not think the public understand that no policy is pursued by civil servants unless four individuals&#8212;the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Chief Secretary to the Treasury&#8212;sign off on them. Unless they do so, civil servants will not deal with those policies. That is what has stuffed us on the Conservative Benches.</p>

	<p pid="c.524.1/1">I am not suggesting for a moment that my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is not sincere in her belief. All I am saying is that the incentives against obtaining alternative advice are massive. If someone goes against the grain of the coalition, they are likely to be stopped at the end of the process anyway, so what is the point? And so we finish up in this position.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.1/2">That episode highlights how impossible it is to put any political will behind the Prime Minister&#8217;s stated aim of a renegotiated relationship with the EU as long as we remain in a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, who take a fundamentally opposite view to ours.</p>

	<p pid="c.524.2/1">I normally agree with everything that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40039" name="Gerald Howarth">the Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth)</phrase> says, but I wonder whether this quad thing is a bit of a myth. It is a convenient myth that the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Home Secretary find useful in explaining why they cannot pursue Conservative policies, but surely the Prime Minister or the Foreign Secretary can instruct their civil servants. I cannot believe it&#8212;I may be wrong; my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase> is the Chair of the Public Administration Committee&#8212;but it is an extraordinary way to run a country.</p>

	<p pid="c.524.3/1">It has been made clear throughout the civil service that there can be no policy except Government policy, and Government policy is filtered through the coalition arrangements, over which there is a mutual veto in that unless there is agreement, there is no policy. If the Home Secretary had started out on the premise of an alternative policy&#8212;of multilateralism or of a simple bilateral arrangement on such matters&#8212;she would have been up against not only the vested interests in the EU, with their determination to block this kind of thing and the residual resistance of the status quo, but the added pressure against attempting to do such a thing that exists in the way the civil service operates under the</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/2">coalition. I am afraid that that is just a fact. On some occasions, Ministers have asked for papers or legislation to be prepared on their behalf, and there has been a blanket refusal because it is not Government policy if it has not been approved by the coalition; that is a fact.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/3">The episode demonstrates that another year of coalition is another year of paralysis and inertia on EU policy, because the machinery of government is hostage to the coalition. That is another reason why we should either end the coalition in the run-up to the election or, indeed, call an earlier general election. I believe that we will rue the day that we voted&#8212;I did not, but the House did&#8212;for fixed-term Parliaments.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/4">The present paralysis also makes nonsense of the Government&#8217;s current policy on the EU. I admire the stand made by the Prime Minister over Mr Juncker, but it just shows that although the Prime Minister may get permission within the coalition to make what amount to grand gestures, he cannot get permission for any policy of substance that purports to advance the objectives he has so ably set out.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/5">The decision on the justice and home affairs opt-ins should be seen in that very serious context, because there are very serious implications. The way in which my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister&#8217;s challenge to Mr Juncker was dismissed at the Ypres summit indicates that the EU will resist any fundamental reform. That could not be clearer from the events at the summit. We saw not only how the ambiguity in the treaties will continue to be exploited by those who want to carry on the process of centralisation, but how the UK&#8217;s attempt to boost the role of national Parliaments&#8212;the fourth principle from the Bloomberg speech&#8212;was all but eliminated from the final conclusions, as was pointed out by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/6">There should be no need in this House to reiterate the importance of our national Parliament to our democracy, or to point out that under the UK&#8217;s constitution Parliament is, and must remain, supreme. However, the Ypres summit and its decisions underline how EU treaties and institutions deny such an essential element of the UK&#8217;s constitutional autonomy under the present terms of membership. Since Maastricht, we have seen that opt-outs, subsidiarity and talk of different degrees or speeds of EU integration make no difference to the direction of the EU. Consequently, the legal protections concerning disproportionality and dual criminality are potentially meaningless.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/7">Incidentally, the removal of the words &#8220;ever closer union&#8221; from the preamble of the EU treaties would make no change at all to how the European Commission, Court and Parliament behave. It would not remove a single treaty base of a single EU legal instrument or court ruling, and I emphasise that it would not prevent the European Court of Justice from setting aside any domestic protection that we may enact in respect of the European arrest warrant. That is because the EU treaties are not consistent with the UK&#8217;s constitutional position, or with the Prime Minister&#8217;s stated desire for the UK to be an independent nation state.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/8">The practical importance of addressing the issues set out by the Prime Minister&#8212;they include immigration, freedom of movement, the single market and energy prices&#8212;is self-evident. However, any concessions that</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/9">we obtain will be nugatory in their effect unless we also obtain recognition of the main principle at stake&#8212;namely, that of the supremacy of the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/10">In the UK, all EU laws and treaties rest upon the UK Parliament, which voluntarily agreed to the 1972 Act. This took place in the context of the unambiguous assurance that national sovereignty would be maintained after we joined. That was set out in the 1971 White Paper. Many subsequent treaties, and measures such as these, have been adopted by Act of Parliament, but the fundamental and ultimate role of the UK Parliament has never been vitiated. Had the UK adopted the EU constitution, that might have changed, but for now at least, the European Communities Act 1972 remains the foundation Act, and every EU law in the UK is subject to the constitutional principle of voluntary acceptance by the UK Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/11">Those final conclusions of the European Council, along with so many other statements from other EU leaders and from European institutions such as the Commissioner and the European Parliament, do not accept our view. They speak and act as though the European Parliament is paramount, and attribute only a subsidiary role to national Parliaments, including our own. This reflects the political reality, which we Conservatives spelled out at the time, that the Lisbon treaty is the EU constitution in all but name. This justice and home affairs decision demonstrates that the Government are doing nothing of practical value to challenge that. The lack of any specific constitutional provision in the Lisbon treaty to make it autochthonous&#8212;that is, dependent on its own provisions for its authority, like a constitution&#8212;does not prevent the majority of EU states or the EU institutions from behaving in that way.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/12">This question of constitutional supremacy has now reached a critical point. The point in the final Ypres conclusions about the need for &#8220;strong and credible&#8221; EU institutions but no more than</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/13">&#8220;closer involvement of national parliaments&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/14">underlines the fact that the EU is set against anything that seeks to reassert the supremacy of the UK Parliament in the European Union. It is beyond any doubt that such a proposal would even be considered, because it would take only one other member state to veto any such proposal.</p>
	<p pid="c.524.3/15">In these circumstances, it would be impossible for any leader of the Conservative party to campaign to vote to stay in the European Union, either in a referendum or at the next general election, without making it clear that he had a clear bottom line in the renegotiations that our new relationship with the EU must be based on the supremacy of our national Parliament, at least, and that otherwise, we would have to leave the treaties and seek that new relationship from outside.</p>

	<p pid="c.527.0/1">I am delighted to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase> and, indeed, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase>&#8212;a brother knight who had the responsibility of looking after my old school at Bloxham. I have always had great affection for my right hon. Friend the Member for Banbury, even though he has been somewhat unsound on European matters. No doubt he will be awarded some further grand honour by the Association of Chief Police Officers; I can see him as the guest of honour at a grand function, funded no doubt by G4S as there is no public money for such things.</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/2">I agree overwhelmingly with my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex, particularly on the sovereignty of this Parliament. Whereas it is entirely right that we should take into account the evidence of those who are operating at the coal face, such as members of ACPO, it is our duty here in this Parliament to look at the wider issues and the wider consequences.</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/3">I suppose that I take as my text the joint report of the European Scrutiny, Home Affairs and Justice Committees of <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-26">26 March</phrase>, which states in paragraph 1:</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/4">&#8220;Whether EU measures covered by the so-called &#8216;2014 block opt-out decision&#8217; continue to apply to the United Kingdom and become subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice from <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December 2014</phrase> is a profoundly significant issue.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/5">That is absolutely right and I pay tribute to the Chairmen and members of those three Committees for their detailed and measured response on this important matter. I also pay tribute to my right hon. Friends the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary, on whose shoulders rests the responsibility for charting a course that not only satisfies the coalition, but reconciles the need to protect our constituents and secure law and order in this country, and the need to preserve the rights of this sovereign Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/6">I will be brief, Madam Deputy Speaker, because I have just two key concerns and they are very straightforward. The first is that, by opting into these measures, we will lock ourselves into the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in perpetuity. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> said earlier, home affairs and justice was originally a third pillar matter that was decided on by sovereign nations and was not subject to qualified majority voting. My hon. Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex gave a litany of quotations, not least from my right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General, on the implications of signing up to these measures and subjecting ourselves to the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/7">We have no excuse any more. We have seen how the European Court of Justice has sought constantly to arrogate greater and greater powers, and even to overrule our Supreme Court. We would be failing in our duty to</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/8">the people we represent if we did not spell out to them the very real risks that lay before them if we continue to provide the European Court of Justice with further powers. By doing so, we undermine not only our position in this Parliament, but the interests of our constituents; for they will have no one to whom they can turn if the European Court of Justice continues to exercise these responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/9">My second concern is about the political message that will be sent out by the Government&#8217;s decision to opt back into 35 of the measures. As we approach the next general election, Europe is assuming greater and greater significance. Those of us who have banged on about Europe, to use a popular expression, have done so because European matters pervade our national life at every level. The biggest concern that the public have today is immigration. Why is that? It is because the issue of immigration is overwhelmingly about our ability to control our own borders.</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/10">I am sure that I am not alone in finding on the doorstep that our constituents do not believe the Prime Minister when he says that he will hold a referendum if we are returned as a majority Government at the next general election. That is the case, notwithstanding his efforts in vetoing the fiscal treaty, cutting the EU budget, supporting the European Union (Referendum) Bill and, most recently, tackling the issue of the presidency of the European Commission. He has demonstrated his commitment to trying to resolve those matters and addressing the real concerns of the British people, but because he suggested before the last election that we would have a referendum if we assumed power, that has been constantly brought up as though he has failed to deliver on a promise. That referendum was conditional on the Lisbon treaty not having come into force by 2010, but it did come into force and therefore there was no point in holding a referendum.</p>
	<p pid="c.527.0/11">As we talk about further negotiations with our European partners on reorganising Britain&#8217;s relationship with the EU, I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Harwich and North Essex: this sends a completely different message. We have had the battle with Mr Juncker and expressed the Prime Minister&#8217;s rejection of ever-closer union and of the whole project, yet we will be portrayed by our opponents and by the public as having signed up to a raft of measures that touch on some of the most sensitive issues around the protection of our people, such as the ability to deport foreign criminals or return those who have fled the country but are charged with offences in the UK. People are bound to say, &#8220;We hear what you say about having a referendum, but when you&#8217;re faced with a practical decision on whether to opt back into home affairs and justice measures, you opt back in. We know what that means in terms of the European Court of Justice&#8217;s jurisdiction&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="c.528.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that there is a sort of whiff of appeasement going on here? Basically, we do not want the jurisdiction of European institutions, including the Court, but on the other hand we do not want to resist their intrusion into our becoming more integrated into the European Union. When it comes to the balance between those two positions, the Government increasingly give the impression that they do not want to do that, but they go along with it in practice. That is a very dangerous path.</p>

	<p pid="c.529.0/1">My hon. Friend is right, and I set out earlier what I felt the dilemma to be. Undoubtedly, the Home Secretary and Justice Secretary are receiving shed-loads of advice from law enforcement agencies, saying that we must protect the European arrest warrant and all our ties with our European partners because to do otherwise would make our task of enforcing law and order more and more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.0/2">I understand where the Home Secretary is coming from, and again I will quote from the excellent European Scrutiny Committee, which is chaired by my hon. Friend the Member for Stone. In its report of <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-07">7 November</phrase> last year, it cited the Home Secretary as having said a year ago on:</p>
	<p pid="c.529.0/3">&#8220;We believe the UK should opt out of the measures in question for reasons of principle, policy, and pragmatism. And we should only seek to rejoin those measures that help us co-operate with our European neighbours to combat cross-border crime and keep our country safe.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2013-07-09.177"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 July 2013; Vol. 566, c. 177</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.529.0/4">Who could possibly disagree with that? We are all in favour of that and of arrangements that enable the efficacious management of our borders, and the return of criminals and so on, but other issues are at stake. How will the European Court of Justice interpret these matters, and how&#8212;as I said a moment earlier&#8212;will the public see that? Of course we need to protect the public, but I suggest, as my hon. Friends have done, that we also need to resist the risk of subjecting ourselves to further control by the European Court of Justice.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.0/5">How do we bridge the gap? I understand that it is entirely possible that we could have transitional arrangements that could apply from <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>. Come <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>, we opt out en bloc and at the same time opt back in on the 35 measures that are the subject of this debate. By then, it is possible to have transitional arrangements to extend our ability to have those measures in force, pending a final decision here in the UK. The Home Secretary has said that Denmark&#8217;s opt-out arrangements remain subject to the European Court of Justice. Why do we not have alternative arrangements that do not subject us to the ECJ? We do not need to follow Denmark&#8217;s example and can chart our own course. Surely this is a magnificent opportunity for Mr Junker and his cohort to demonstrate their commitment to recognising that the UK&#8217;s issues need to be addressed and to accommodate the UK&#8217;s concerns. We can provide them with an early opportunity. Come <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>, they can show us that, yes, they understand the nationwide concern in this country on these matters and come to an accommodation with the UK.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.0/6">These are massively important issues. I understand from Ministers that there will be a proper full-day&#8217;s debate later this year, followed by a substantive vote, and not in a deferred Division or anything like that, when the House can have its proper say.</p>

	<p pid="c.529.1/1">It is a great pleasure, as always, to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40039" name="Gerald Howarth">the Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth)</phrase>, who put the arguments succinctly. I agree with the comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase>. Both my hon. Friends summed up the flavour of the debate. As we approach the end of the debate, the arguments on both sides have been fairly put, so I will not detain the House for too long.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/2">As we saw in the recent European elections, there is a strong feeling in this country that we should have less interference from Brussels. The justice and home affairs opt-outs give us a golden opportunity to demonstrate to the British public that we are in tune with how they think about the European Union. They want less interference from Brussels, not more.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/3">There is a strong feeling that people thought they were entering a common market back in 1973, and they voted to remain members of it in 1975. It was referred to back then as the European Economic Community and the Common Market. Effectively, it was a free trade area. However, those behind the grand euro project were not satisfied with just a common market. They saw it as just the first step towards building a single European superstate. The European Economic Community soon became just the European Community&#8212;the word &#8220;economic&#8221; was dropped altogether, reflecting the wider and grander aims of the European project. The European Community swiftly became the European Union, as another step was taken towards creating a single superstate.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/4">Why did I start with that background? I did so because the European Union&#8217;s powers over justice and home affairs are an example of its growing power and influence. It has become far more than just a common market. It already has its own Parliament, its own flag, its own national anthem, its own civil service, its own foreign and diplomatic service and its own court. It has all the attributes of a state, so it is no surprise that those behind the European project want to develop a single European-wide system of justice and home affairs.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/5">At a time when there is a desire among millions of our fellow citizens for the European Union to have less influence, we should be taking this golden opportunity to take back powers. Let us be clear on what is at stake: above all else, this is a matter of principle. If we exercise an opt-in&#8212;voluntarily, because there is no obligation on this country to opt in&#8212;it will mean that yet again the powers of the institutions of this country will be reduced and power transferred to the institutions of the European Union. At a time when we are saying to the British public that we want powers back from Brussels, it is not, I would venture to suggest, a very good start to voluntarily give up power over these 35 different measures.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/6">As the Government themselves said when they gave evidence to the House of Lords European Select Committee:</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/7">&#8220;the practical effect of the ECJ gaining full jurisdiction in this area after the transitional period&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/8">which, of course, means from <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December 2014</phrase>&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/9">&#8220;is that the ECJ may interpret these measures expansively and beyond the scope originally intended. This concern is compounded by the fact that the ECJ has previously ruled in the area of Justice and Home Affairs in unexpected and unhelpful ways from a UK perspective&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/10">So there we have it. The Government know that there is a real risk that once these powers are handed over to the EU there is no turning back and the European Court of Justice can interpret them as they think fit.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/11">In the Government&#8217;s response to the European Scrutiny Committee&#8217;s November 2013 report on the block opt-out, the Government said the following about the rulings of the ECJ:</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/12">&#8220;We have also set out our concerns with the impact of these judgements on the domestic law. If we disagree with the ECJ&#8217;s interpretation of legislation, it will be impossible for the UK to</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/13">amend the law itself. Indeed, it would be very difficult to alter it at all as this would require the Commission to propose an amendment to the EU legislation itself, or a cohort of Member States to do so under the auspices of a Member State initiative.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/14">Such a cohort would have to consist of a quarter of all member states. The European Parliament&#8217;s agreement would also generally be needed to amend the relevant EU legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/15">We must not forget that the European Court of Justice, in determining cases, would start to apply its human rights jurisprudence, arising from the European Union&#8217;s own charter of fundamental rights, to the UK&#8217;s policing and criminal justice system. It would, therefore, be all very well for us to try to negotiate or even unilaterally opt out of the European convention on human rights, but the fact remains that if we remain members of the European Union, we would be bound by the European Court of Justice and its implementation of the EU&#8217;s charter of fundamental rights.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/16">Perhaps the most worrying of the measures that it is proposed to opt back into is the European arrest warrant. We have heard much about it this afternoon, but let us be clear about what the European arrest warrant means. It gives other countries in the European Union the power to demand that a British subject be removed from this country and incarcerated in a foreign jail without any evidence being placed before a British court. Worst of all, the European arrest warrant could be used for some act or omission that is not a criminal offence in this country, where the conduct is wholly within a foreign country. Indeed, that aspect&#8212;dual criminality&#8212;was one of the principal grounds that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister used to argue against the introduction of the European arrest warrant in the Extradition Act 2003. He voted against it.</p>
	<p pid="c.529.1/17">There is perhaps a silver lining to every cloud. As someone who thinks that this country would be better off outside the European Union, let me say this in conclusion. If the Government decide, as I am sure they will, to opt back into these measures&#8212;despite what those of us who have reservations might think, I am sure that in the fullness of time this House will vote to allow the Government to do so&#8212;they will hand over power to the European Union on these issues for ever more. However, in so doing, they will provide yet another reason why, I believe, in the fullness of time millions of our fellow citizens will decide that the only way for this country to regain its own sovereignty will be to vote to leave the European Union.</p>

	<p pid="c.531.0/1">It is a particular pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40134" name="David Nuttall">the Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall)</phrase>, although I am delighted that the Lord Chancellor will reply to the debate, because I believe he is the one person remaining in the Government who still believes what he believed in opposition. It is reassuring that at least some people do not find the trappings of office take them away from their previous beliefs.</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/2">As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase> mentioned, we have already looked at the falsehood that is in the title of this debate. We are meant to be debating the opt-outs, but they were decided a year ago. We are debating the opt-ins. That is all of a piece with the spin and the flimflam around this</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/3">issue. We are not trying to stick to the facts. We have had bold promises&#8212;promises raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>&#8212;about consultation with Parliament and how we would be kept fully informed: a fine promise and constitutionally proper, but regrettably ignored.</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/4">We found out some information about the Pr&#252;m declarations not from a statement to this House or from evidence given to a Select Committee, but via a website called Statewatch, which reproduces leaked documents. It reproduced a &#8220;Limit&#233;&#8221; document from the European Union. &#8220;Limit&#233;&#8221; documents from the European Union can be shared with the European Scrutiny Committee and we would then hold them confidentially. This one was not, perhaps because what it said was rather embarrassing. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/5">&#8220;The UK government has also indicated that in a number of other cases it will set in motion a process towards the subsequent opting in to certain other instruments of particular importance.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/6">So it is not 35 opt-ins; it is more than 35, which they are not willing to tell us about through proper processes. We find out through leaked documents. Actually, it is not 35 anyway, because 14 were already subject to the block opt-out. So we are starting at 49, not 35, and the spin around it tries to lessen the impact of what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/7">The failure to inform Parliament is, I think, even worse. There was a Council meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-24">24 June</phrase>, after which the European Union put out a press release stating that</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/8">&#8220;the Council noted the conclusion reached between the Commission and the UK on the list of non-Schengen ex-third pillar measures which the UK will seek to rejoin&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/9">I emphasise &#8220;conclusion&#8221;. The written statement from the Minister provided to the House about a week later&#8212;we should note the delay before we were informed&#8212;said that</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/10">&#8220;the UK Government and the Commission had reached an understanding&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wms/2014-06-30.48"><i>Official Report</i>, 30 June 2014; Vol. 583, c. 48WS</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/11">There is a significant difference between an understanding and a conclusion: one has a finality about it, which does not leave much room for parliamentary consultation, while the other implies a continuing process. We have thus had a series of failures properly to inform Parliament&#8212;a failure to be entirely straight with the British people.</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/12">The effects are severe. The change from the third pillar to Lisbon is a major transfer of sovereignty, as established by my hon. Friend the Member for Bury North, who quoted the Government&#8217;s own words in saying that. It is not, however, only the Government and the European Scrutiny Committee that make this clear, as it can be seen in the Home Affairs Select Committee, too. This is important because that Select Committee is not made up of shaven-headed Eurosceptics; it is chaired by a former Minister for Europe who views himself very much as a pro-European. His Committee&#8217;s report said:</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/13">&#8220;If the Government proceeds with the opt-in as proposed, we note that it will not result in any repatriation. Indeed, the increased jurisdiction of the ECJ may result in a net flow of powers in the opposite direction.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/14">Yet we have heard statements from Ministers saying precisely the reverse. There must be a thin line between on the one hand the point at which Ministers say things</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/15">that are different from what they say to House of Lords Select Committees and from what reports of respected Committees of this House have said and on the other hand the sin of misleading Parliament. I know we will watch like hawks to ensure that that thin line is never breached.</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/16">Of the much-trumpeted opt-outs of nearly 100 items, 43 never applied to the United Kingdom in the first place. I have a list of the remainder. I asked 190 parliamentary questions to establish this list and to find out how many of the items were of any importance. Thirty three have been implemented and will bring no change at all; 12 have been implemented de facto and, again, there will be no change; two have been implemented but never used; and two have not been implemented. That leaves one, the Council Act of <phrase class="date" code="1998-06-17">17 June 1998</phrase>, which has been implemented and will suffer from some change. Excluding Pr&#252;m, there is no repatriation of sovereignty at all from any of our opt-outs.</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/17">That leads us to the alternatives&#8212;those measures that the Government wish to remain within, as is clear from the treaties and from questions of international law. The treaties make it clear that provision is made for transitional arrangements. Hence, there need be no worry about a great chasm opening up on <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>, when this mass horde of 125 criminals will suddenly appear on our shores, about which we should be terrified. It will not be like that at all because of the transitional arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="c.531.0/18">Then there is the possibility of bilateral arrangements. The Home Secretary&#8217;s response on bilateral arrangements was so feeble: we know she has lost her much-respected special adviser, but I had not realised that the person on work experience was now writing her speeches. Just because the European Union does not like it&#8212;the Commission indicated that it would not accept it&#8212;are we saying that we should not use our power and influence as one of the great nations of the world and even try to negotiate what we want with an international body? Should we immediately kowtow and give in? What sort of a Home Secretary takes that approach?</p>

	<p pid="c.533.0/1">It seems from the stance adopted by the Government that we are being invited to believe that the European Union is a deeply unreasonable institution that holds very hard and fast positions on which it is not prepared to compromise even in its own interests, let alone the interests of its member states. Does my hon. Friend not think that we should have tried a bit harder?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.533.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" speakername="Jacob Rees-Mogg" colnum="533"  time="015:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0003.htm#140710-0003.htm_spnew38">
	<p pid="c.533.1/1">That is exactly the point I was making. It bodes ill for any proposal for renegotiation if that is the starting point. The moment the European Union says &#8220;We don&#8217;t like that very much, chaps&#8221; and we say &#8220;Oh, we&#8217;re frightfully sorry, m&#8217;lord&#8221;, we are not even going to try. We shall perform the kowtow, that wonderful act performed in front of Chinese emperors, whereby people would abase themselves three times before approaching the throne. That may be appropriate to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, enthroned in splendour as you are, but it is not, I think, the way in which Her Majesty&#8217;s Government should behave when dealing with international bodies.</p>
	<p pid="c.533.1/2">Then there is the European arrest warrant, and the so-called guarantees that we have. As has already been established during the debate, European law trumps Acts of Parliament. So we can say that the European arrest warrant must not apply unless there is dual criminality, but unless the European Union accepts it, that is not the case, and dual criminality does not have to be shown in relation to 32 specified crimes where the arrest warrant applies. What the Prime Minister said to my hon. Friend the Member for Bury North during Prime Minister&#8217;s Question Time yesterday was, I am sorry to say, not factually accurate.</p>
	<p pid="c.533.1/3">As for the numbers, I have banged on about them because of the hysteria that we hear from the proponents of the arrest warrant, who claim that our whole nation&#8217;s security is dependent on it. On average, 125 people are brought back to this country each year to face trial. In that context, the arrest warrant is to our benefit and in our interest. The people whom we expel we ought to be able to expel under our own law, and would be able to if only we had the gumption to pass our own laws. As was said earlier, we are now willing to sacrifice the fundamental principle of Magna Carta: that no one will be imprisoned, fined or held against their will without the judgment of a court. We are now willing to allow that principle to be abrogated by a Polish magistrate. Surely, wise and good though Polish magistrates may be, it is not worth the theft of a wheelbarrow to undermine something that has been our protector for 799 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.533.1/4">I want to deal with the politics of this as well, for where does it leave not only the Government but the Conservative party, which had, until a few weeks ago, a really sensible, logical, well-thought-through position on the European Union. It had a strong and sound and firm position, which was to go for renegotiation and repatriate powers. Repatriate powers? When we have just surrendered them? Wave the white flag, and then, two hours later, put up the Union Jack at half mast? Will anyone believe that we have a hope of repatriating powers if we surrender them now? Will anyone think that opting into 35 measures, 49 measures, and a few more secretly, is the beginning of a renegotiation? Will anyone believe the promises made by politicians or the policies on which we stood at the last election&#8212;as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury North revealed to us&#8212;or the soaring oratory of our Prime Minister, who in 2002, in opposing the European arrest warrant, said:</p>
	<p pid="c.533.1/5">&#8220;If someone came before him who had committed an offence that was not a crime in this country, according to the district judge, the Home Secretary would have to say, &#8216;I am sorry. You may spend time rotting in a Greek or Spanish jail&#8230;But there is nothing I can do about it.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-12-09.109"><i>Official Report</i>, 9 December 2002; Vol. 396, c. 109</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.533.1/6">So, in 2002, the Prime Minister was worried that this would lead to people rotting in Spanish or Greek jails. Now he thinks that rotting in Spanish or Greek jails seems to be a good thing. I do not see the logic in that, but I equally do not see how anyone can rely on what politicians say if in opposition they have backbone and in government they are jellyfish. It is an entirely hopeless way of attempting to run the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.533.1/7">Let me end with a reminder of Sir Robert Peel, a great Prime Minister and a distinguished man, one of the most intellectual figures ever to hold the office that he held&#8212;and he was Home Secretary as well. When he did his final papers&#8212;they were vivas, not papers&#8212;so</p>
	<p pid="c.533.1/8">clever was he, so intelligent was he, that the public went to listen to him answering the questions, and he got a first-class degree in classics and mathematics. In 1846, he split the Conservative party. He got through a measure that the Conservatives loathed on the back of Opposition votes&#8212;something that may happen with the European arrest warrant&#8212;but he stood boldly at the Dispatch Box and said, yes, he had changed his mind, yes, what he now thought was different from what he thought before, but it was essential for the good of the nation.</p>
	<p pid="c.533.1/9">Do we have that from this Front Bench? Do we have an avowal of the importance of this surrender to Europe, or do we have mealy-mouthed words about the difficulties of negotiation and the problems with coalition? There is not a bold, forthright, intellectual case for change, but merely the convenience of office, and it not only risks damaging the Government and splitting the Tory party, but it surrenders our sovereignty to a body from which we want to get it back. So I say to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government,</p>
	<p pid="c.533.1/10">&#8220;Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood . . . then imitate the action of the tiger.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.535.0/1">It is always a pleasure&#8212;nay, an honour&#8212;to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase>, who speaks with vigour and all the colour that we have come to expect from him. Those of us who have known him since long before 2010 know that he is characteristically forthright on these issues. Whether he is absolutely right on them is another matter, however, and it is to the issue about which he has rightly expressed concern today that I now turn, bearing in mind the time remaining and the need for other speakers to make their contributions.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.0/2">Yes, the opt-ins do involve some concession of sovereignty. To try and deny that would be wholly wrong. The issue, therefore, is one of competence and the extent to which the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg determines issues that fall to be decided as to the interpretation and operation of the measures, subject to the opt-in. On that, to some degree I share some of the concerns raised by my hon. Friends on the Conservative Benches.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.0/3">I am an opponent of judicial activism. As a politician who is philosophically of the centre-right, I do not believe that it is for judges to interpret treaties and other documents as living instruments which adapt according to their view of the world at any one time. We see that problem in the Court at Strasbourg and the Court in Luxembourg, but we also see that problem in the courts here in London, here in England, here in Wales, here in Scotland. This is not an issue that is particular to Europe and its institutions. That is a very important point when we remember the nature and scale of the task before us, because, to my mind, this is not a debate between Westminster and Brussels or Luxembourg; this is a debate about whether it is legislators&#8212;politicians&#8212;who ultimately determine the extent and ambit of our laws, or whether, as increasingly is the case, our laws are interpreted in different ways by judges.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.0/4">The old certainty of politicians passing and enacting the laws and judges implementing them and making determinations on a case-by-case basis gets more blurred</p>
	<p pid="c.535.0/5">with the passage of the years, and that worries me, as a Conservative, and I know it worries all my fellow Conservatives. I know it worries my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor. We discussed the matter only yesterday in the Justice Committee, and he made some very wise interventions about his concerns about judicial activism.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.0/6">Therefore, I thoroughly understand and embrace the concerns that are being expressed by my hon. Friends. What I take issue with them on is this: the full extent to which the European Court of Justice will have jurisdiction upon the general run of justice and home affairs in this country. I accept that on the opt-out issues it will have jurisdiction, and there are dangers that, as we have seen with other interpretations&#8212;for example, of the free movement directive&#8212;there could be judicial creep and an extension beyond the original intentions of those who framed the directives we are talking about. But when it comes to the fundamentals of English and Welsh justice, I see no threat to the long-established traditions, customs, laws and practices that we have in our criminal courts. I see no threat to the principle of trial by jury. I see no threat to the inferences that are to be drawn from the exercise by suspects of their right to silence.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.0/7">We have had debates on these things. I recall going with my right hon. Friend the Chair of the Justice Committee to Brussels to discuss a directive, which is now coming to the fore, about the inferences to be drawn from the exercise by the accused of the right to silence when arrested. We had a lively discussion in the justice directorate-general about the inappropriateness of that particular directive in its application to the criminal law of England and Wales. That sort of detailed case-by-case, directive-by-directive discussion will be the surest safeguard against the general creep that my hon. Friends and others fear.</p>

	<p pid="c.536.1/1">My hon. Friend asks the fundamental question we should always ask, about not just European legislation, but domestic legislation and the way in which we in this House have legislated in an unsatisfactory and ambiguous way that has opened the door to more and more judicial review, more and more challenge and more and more interpretation by domestic courts in ways that were perhaps not envisaged by the legislators.

	<p pid="c.537.3/1">But remembering that the competence of the ECJ deals with the application of EU law in the UK, we have to be very careful about the words we use, because very often people misunderstand the full ambit of that Court. Another example would be the way in which case law in Strasbourg is wrongly assumed to be the law of this land&#8212;it is not the law of this land and never has been, not even under the much-reviled Human Rights Act. There are little misunderstandings that germinate into a general feeling among the public that we have lost control.</p>

	<p pid="c.537.5/1">I disagree. It is up to us in this House and elsewhere to show leadership and to explain to people that we have not lost the degree of control that has been suggested. As much as I admire my hon. Friend, I sometimes think that his is a counsel of despair when it comes to the future of Britain in Europe. It is time for us to remind ourselves that we are still a country with huge influence and that we still have a massive part to play in the affairs and future of the European Union. We are one of the biggest economies in Europe, and there are very many strategic interests that make our membership of the EU good not only for us but for other member states.</p>
	<p pid="c.537.5/2">Before I resume my seat, I will return to the issues at hand. The European arrest warrant is not only in this country&#8217;s interest because we can repatriate UK citizens from other member states who are alleged to have committed crimes in this country; it also ensures that EU nationals who are fleeing and evading justice in their own country can be sent back. Those practical realities bring us back from the theoretical debate that we sometimes have here. We are talking about real lives and the tragedies that surround every criminal case about which we have heard this afternoon, which we know is a real issue for those involved. Let us not forget the human element.</p>
	<p pid="c.537.5/3">I have gone through the list of measures, and it seems that the principle of mutual recognition of criminal offences, for example, will be very important not because of the way in which we operate the courts in England</p>
	<p pid="c.537.5/4">and Wales but because of the way in which other member states recognise UK criminal convictions, which is an important point. If UK citizens go to other member states and commit offences, it is right and in the general interests of combating crime and properly reflecting criminality that their convictions recorded in the UK are properly recognised. Those are practical measures that not only address the need to combat crime but help to increase trade and commerce&#8212;all the efficacy arguments that are a natural part of what it is to be a member state of a developing Union that is the biggest market in the world. It is the continent of which we are a part. I think, therefore, that the practical realities reflected in the opt-in measures are a proper reflection of the absolute need for this country to work hand in hand with other member states and to ensure that we can have a criminal justice system that works well for all British citizens, not just here in the UK but in other parts of the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.537.5/5">The European arrest warrant has been properly criticised on the grounds of proportionality. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40253" name="Dominic Raab">the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab)</phrase> will shortly wax lyrical on the matter with his customary expertise and I look forward to his contribution with interest, but I would say that the introduction of the amendments on proportionality in recent legislation goes a long way towards addressing the concerns that he and others have repeatedly expressed. I have the same sorts of concerns about the disproportionate use of such a serious measure. The decision to extradite or to remove someone from one jurisdiction to another is a serious step to take.</p>
	<p pid="c.537.5/6">We have to be practical about this issue, and the Government have done everything they can to ensure that, although we have opted out of the general swath of measures&#8212;I think that was the right decision&#8212;we are, after looking at the evidence on a case-by-case basis, making the proper decision to opt in to the measures that we are debating today. On that basis, I am happy to support my right hon. Friends on the Front Bench.</p>

	<p pid="c.538.0/1">It is a great pleasure, as always, to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40555" name="Robert Buckland">the Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland)</phrase>. Although we do not see these issues in exactly the same way, he always provides a huge amount of food for thought, delivered with great style and panache. I apologise to Members on both sides of the House for arriving late to the debate. I gave advance notice to the Speaker. It was because of the two statements and an engagement that I could not get out of.</p>
	<p pid="c.538.0/2">I want to start the substance of my comments by welcoming the opportunity for Parliament to scrutinise this issue. Whatever one believes about the substance, we are getting far more scrutiny in this whole area than we ever did under the previous Government. I also want to say that I fully support the Prime Minister&#8217;s overarching strategy. In his article in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-16">16 March</phrase>, he made clear his intention to renegotiate Britain&#8217;s relationship with the EU, including, as he spelt out explicitly, in the area of crime and policing. I think that he is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="c.538.0/3">It is worth noting that polling commissioned by Open Europe has found that this matter, far from being some ivory tower issue with no resonance or relevance to the</p>
	<p pid="c.538.0/4">public, was the public&#8217;s fourth highest priority for renegotiation. It is therefore right not only in principle, but in terms of resonance and relevance to the great British public. Likewise, the Prime Minister showed tremendous moral clarity in fighting not only for Britain, but for an important democratic principle in relation to the next EU Commission President. I feel that we need to do the same now.</p>
	<p pid="c.538.0/5">I will avoid rehearsing points I have made in previous debates on the topic, which I know Ministers will have heard until they are blue in the face. I will instead confine my remarks to four key points. First, I believe that we must take a long-term view about the supranational direction of EU justice and home affairs policy, taking into account the evolution of policy and law, the ambitions of the Commission and the tidal direction of travel among EU member states. One does not have to buy into Viviane Reding&#8217;s dream of an EU-wide Minister of Justice to see that we are taking incremental steps, slowly but surely, like a slow tide, towards a single EU justice system. We can debate the pace, but I challenge anyone in the House to argue that that is not happening in practice.</p>
	<p pid="c.538.0/6">One need only look at Europol and Eurojust. Currently, colleges of national police and prosecutors collaborate on important cross-border work, such as combating drugs, human trafficking and terrorism. Originally they co-operated on an essentially intergovernmental basis, but national democratic control is slowly but surely being whittled away before our eyes, like salami-slicing. If we look at the detail of the two new regulations on Europol and Eurojust, we see a strengthened role for the Commission, additional duties of co-operation on national Governments and, most importantly, the eroding of national Governments&#8217; ability to decline requests for co-operation or to hand over data.</p>
	<p pid="c.538.0/7">Eurojust&#8217;s revised mandate will provide substantial co-operation with the new EU Public Prosecutor&#8217;s Office, which will grow in time, leading to more and more pressure for it to consume functions currently undertaken by Eurojust. That is inevitable. We can see it happening bit by bit. If we were truly drawing a line in the sand, would we not make it clear now that we will not be opting into those new measures?</p>
	<p pid="c.538.0/8">At the same time, if we opt into the basket of measures, as the Government propose doing, we will hand from the British Supreme Court to the European Court in Luxemburg the last judicial word on the scope of these swelling supranational powers and our corresponding national democratic duties. I, for one, am reluctant to see that happen because of the European Court of Justice&#8217;s record of judicial activism. In answer to my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon, the difference is that judicial activism in the UK can be overruled by elected and accountable Members in this House. That democratic control is not available in relation to decisions of the ECJ, which are being extended bit by bit.</p>
	<p pid="c.538.0/9">We saw that in the High Court last year, when Mr Justice Mostyn, hardly a right winger on the judicial benches, made it very clear that, to his great surprise, the ECJ had torn up our opt-out from the EU&#8217;s new charter of fundamental rights. We saw it with the ECJ&#8217;s attitude towards the extraterritorial application of the EU Tobin tax to Britain&#8212;although, those proceedings are still ongoing. And we saw it this year with the ECJ&#8217;s frankly ludicrous ruling on internet search engines, conjuring</p>
	<p pid="c.538.0/10">from thin air a &#8220;right to be forgotten.&#8221; That is important, because we can argue about the rights and wrongs of privacy and transparency, but that was patently judicial activism, and there is very little that we in this House can do about it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.540.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" speakername="William Cash" colnum="540"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0003.htm#140710-0003.htm_spnew51">
	<p pid="c.540.0/1">We are talking about not just one judge but several judges who are making similar remarks. They are genuinely demonstrating a frustration with the overarching jurisdiction of the European Court. In the past few months, we have seen Lord Mance and several others making similar comments. They are conscious of the difficulties that are arising.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.540.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40253" speakername="Dominic Raab" colnum="540"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0003.htm#140710-0003.htm_spnew52">
	<p pid="c.540.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right that this is a growing problem, and I think that that is recognised at senior levels of the judiciary. We should listen with as much vim and vigour to what the judges have to say as we do to what the Association of Chief Police Officers says.</p>
	<p pid="c.540.1/2">On the internet search engine ruling, it is important to say that there is a cultural and values issue at stake. It is not just some legal constitutional issue. A right to be forgotten may suit French privacy laws that gag the publication of the peccadilloes and crimes of the rich and powerful, but it directly cuts against our tradition of media freedom, transparency and free speech.</p>
	<p pid="c.540.1/3">Having seen the effect of ECJ judicial activism on this area of crime and policing, do we really want to allow the ECJ to determine the powers and responsibilities of British police forces, the British criminal process and even foreign forces, through joint operations, operating on British soil? That is a huge risk for us, and I fear that we risk the Luxembourg Court doing for British policing what the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg has done for UK border controls.</p>
	<p pid="c.540.1/4">One reason why I refuse uncritically to defer to ACPO on these issues is that it is ill-equipped to gauge the long-term threat to operations and ultimately public safety of these developments. These are constitutional developments, so it is not just a question of consulting on the administrative arrangements that we have in place now. If anyone in favour of opting back into these measures had listened to this debate, they would have thought that ACPO had been wholeheartedly in favour of opting into more measures than we are doing. If we look at the evidence it gave to the House of Lords Constitution Committee, we would see that it only recommended opting into 13 measures, which is substantially fewer than the number that we are planning to opt into.</p>
	<p pid="c.540.1/5">The second issue that I wish to address is the European arrest warrant. Many Members will have their own constituency horror stories, and I am afraid that I am no different. In fact, my constituency seems to attract problematic cases. The one that sticks in my mind and, frankly, in my throat is the case of Colin Dines, a former judge of impeccable character who was falsely accused of involvement in a major mafia-related Italian telecoms fraud. The story would be almost amusing if it were not so tragic. Without any evidence presented or any opportunity for him to explain his innocence to the Italian authorities, which he was confident that he could do, he was the subject of a European arrest warrant, which was nodded through by our courts, as they must be. He faced the prospect of incarceration or,</p>
	<p pid="c.540.1/6">at best, house arrest for months on end until his trial. Tragically, the only thing that temporarily saved him from being carted off was that he had a stroke from the stress of it, which meant that he was temporarily deemed not fit to travel. The case remains hanging over him like the sword of Damocles, which is totally unacceptable. It is also unacceptable for me as a law maker in this House to see the fate of citizens across this country.</p>
	<p pid="c.540.1/7">That case is not an isolated injustice. If Members want to grasp the scale of the justice gap under the EU law and the European arrest warrant, they should listen again to our senior judiciary, such as our top extradition judge who gave evidence to the independent inquiry into extradition carried out by Sir Scott Baker. Lord Justice Thomas said that the European arrest warrant system is &#8220;a huge problem&#8221;&#8212;his words. He did not say that it was a small problem, or that there were isolated incidences, but that it was a huge problem that had become &#8220;unworkable&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.540.1/8">I pay tribute to the Home Secretary who has looked very carefully at what can be done within the EU framework decision. Additional safeguards were introduced by the Government in the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 and they are positive steps in the right direction, and the Government deserve great credit for looking at the matter so carefully. In my opinion, the safeguards do not go far enough. That is also the opinion of Fair Trials International. In particular, the bar on extraditing suspects when the case is not trial-ready could be made tighter. I fear that the new leave to appeal requirement undercuts all the safeguards introduced. Above all, it is a shame that we were not allowed any time on the Floor of the House to debate those clauses, important and positive as they were, because they were introduced late in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.540.1/9">I understand from Ministers that there is no appetite in Brussels to revise the EU framework decision itself, a point that I make to my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon. That is a sad reality that we have to accept. The question is what we do next. I believe the preferable option would be to opt out of the European arrest warrant and a renegotiate a bilateral extradition treaty with a limited number of extra safeguards&#8212;the few modest additions that we need to make it safe for our citizens. We would still have fast-track extradition, but we would stop the justice system in effect selling our citizens out, which is what it does at present.</p>

	<p pid="c.541.3/1">I shall address that point squarely in a moment. I need to move on fairly swiftly.</p>
	<p pid="c.541.3/2">In the meantime, between the renegotiation and the opt-outs, we could temporarily continue the EAW arrangements for, say, a year to allow the conclusion of the negotiation. In the worst-case scenario, if partner states in Brussels refused, we would have to fall back on</p>
	<p pid="c.541.3/3">the Council of Europe conventions that predated the European arrest warrant. It has rather breathlessly been suggested that without the EAW, we would risk letting people such as Jeremy Forrest or terrorists such as Osman Hussein go scot-free. That is irresponsible nonsense, and it must be addressed head on. Ideally, we would negotiate a bespoke extradition treaty, as I have suggested. We want something between the old cumbersome conventions and the current automaticity, but even under the Council of Europe treaties, the main temporary effect would be to delay extradition proceedings from weeks to months. That would not mean any fugitive or suspect going free or any increased risk to the British public.</p>
	<p pid="c.541.3/4">I have asked a range of parliamentary questions and written to Ministers on this, and I am grateful for the replies that I have received. The evidence is clear. There certainly are gaps under the Council of Europe conventions. They do not apply to some tax offences, but that is not the same as dangerous criminals threatening public safety. Even then, fewer than 0.4% of prosecutions for tax offences last year were facilitated by a European arrest warrant. The second gap is that Council of Europe conventions would require us to respect the statute of limitations on crimes in other EU jurisdictions. Again, that is hardly the kind of loophole that would stop the hot pursuit of dangerous fugitives. The third gap relates to EU countries that limit extradition of their own nationals, except under an EAW. That would affect extradition requests to Latvia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Belgium and Germany.</p>
	<p pid="c.541.3/5">It is a very odd argument that we must accept the injustice of the European arrest warrant for British nationals because a few other countries have stronger safeguards protecting their citizens in their normal extradition arrangements. In any case, it will have become clear to the House that none of these temporary gaps under the Council of Europe conventions would apply to people such as Jeremy Forrest and Osman Hussein. It is irresponsible scaremongering to suggest that they would. Opting out of the European arrest warrant, on the Government&#8217;s own evidence to me, might for a relatively short period delay EU extradition proceedings while we conclude a better arrangement, but the risk of dangerous fugitives going free is negligible. Public safety is a perfectly respectable, reasonable and legitimate argument to weigh against the threat to individual liberty. We do it in the House all the time. Administrative convenience is not.</p>
	<p pid="c.541.3/6">The third issue I wish to address is that the Government are considering opting into Pr&#252;m measures on data sharing, which would cover fingerprints, DNA, car registration details and so on. There are serious reservations about the impact of this on British citizens, and serious risks. The UK DNA database is far bigger than any other EU database, and innocent British citizens are far more likely to find their samples caught up in a foreign criminal investigation. EU authorities are more likely to assume that the availability of UK DNA samples is a strong indicator of previous criminal behaviour. We know that the EU standard for matching DNA samples is 40% less accurate than the UK standard, which accentuates the risks. Taken together, the Pr&#252;m data sharing, the European investigation order and the European arrest warrant make up a rather dangerous cocktail for an unprecedented number of future miscarriages of justice. The House should have no illusions about that.</p>
	<p pid="c.541.3/7">My final point is about the alternative to opt-ins. The EU has legal personality in the JHA field, so, to answer the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>, if we were refrain from opting back into any of these measures we can negotiate with one party and not 27. So that we understand that it is a practical right and not a theoretical one, let me explain that the EU has already done that with 24 other non-EU countries in JHA, so there is no reason in principle or practice why Britain cannot do the same. I ask Ministers whether that question has been raised in Brussels and what precisely the objections were. If the Government do not feel that that is feasible, has a marker at least been laid down in Brussels about future British renegotiation, making it clear that we will want to return to the whole area of JHA in the round, given what has been said?</p>
	<p pid="c.541.3/8">I suggest that at the very least the Government, or perhaps even the Prime Minister, should make the context behind the decisions clear by letter to the new Presidents of the Commission and of the Council. If not, I fear that this, our best opportunity to demonstrate that we can deliver renegotiation in Europe, runs the risk of being perceived both at home and across the EU as a signal that when push comes to shove our deeds do not match our words.</p>

	<p pid="c.543.0/1">This has been a good debate. By the time we finish, it will have lasted for more than four hours. We have had some excellent speeches, and even some from hon. Members who are not lawyers or Chairs of Select Committees. All 12 speeches have done the important job of holding the Executive to account. They have all been passionate, demonstrating huge expertise on and experience of the issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.0/2">Let me begin, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase> did, by saying that I support most of what the Home Secretary said. Both she and my right hon. Friend made the point that it is no longer the case, if it ever truly was, that tackling crime and keeping the public safe can be achieved solely within our own borders. Crime and the criminals who perpetrate it do not abide by the borders of nation states. Both Front-Bench speakers gave examples of organised crime, terrorism, cybercrime, big drugs cases and serious sexual offences that crossed borders. The world is increasingly interconnected by the movements of people and the movement of trade, and that is all made even more complex as technology moves ahead at a fast pace. We need to ensure that the systems we have in place to prevent crime from taking place and catch those who commit it keep up with that fast pace.</p>

	<p pid="c.543.2/1">I have only a short time in which to speak, but I will give way later if I can.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/2">We owe it to the victims of crime to do what we can to prevent further victims and to bring to justice those who have inflicted harm and misery on others. Part of that involves working closely with our European partners across the European Union to establish working relationships that allow each member state to tackle crime and the community as a whole to cut crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/3">As I said, we have heard 12 speeches. The Chairs of the three Select Committees&#8212;the European Scrutiny Committee, the Select Committee on Home Affairs and the Select Committee on Justice&#8212;all reported extensively on the Government&#8217;s proposals and their concerns about the process, as well as some of their concerns about the substance of the measures. There has been criticism of the fact that the past two debates have been general debates without a vote. In particular, we have discussed whether Parliament will be given a vote on the Government&#8217;s decisions, how many votes there will be, when they will take place and the format in which they will take place, as well as whether each of the measures will be debated and voted on.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/4">Let me be clear that the Opposition will consider all the measures on the basis of what helps the fight against crime. We will not allow anti-European Union feelings to cloud our view of what works. What is needed is a considered response on the issues raised by Back Benchers on the important role that European institutions can and do play in fighting crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/5">The first speech was from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase>, who reminded us of his &#8220;mild interest&#8221; in matters European over the past three decades. Towards the end of his speech, he read out a list of questions that he asked the Justice Secretary to answer. We also look forward to hearing the answers.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/6">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> admitted to being a usual suspect. He asked&#8212;I am looking forward to the answer&#8212;whether there will be a separate vote on the European arrest warrant, about which his Select Committee has raised serious concerns. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">The right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> explained that this process has taught him how difficult it is to get blood out of a stone. He said that notwithstanding his concerns about the process, he supports the measures that assist in fighting crime.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40369" name="Michael Connarty">the Member for Linlithgow and East Falkirk (Michael Connarty)</phrase> reminded us that the European arrest warrant is not perfect and gave an example of one of his constituents who is suffering as a consequence. He explained how it had helped to bring back to this country one of those alleged to have been involved in the <phrase class="date" code="2014-07-21">21 July</phrase> bombings who was subsequently charged and convicted and is currently behind bars.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40040" name="Richard Shepherd">The hon. Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Sir Richard Shepherd)</phrase> reminded us of his experience of seven Parliaments and expressed concern about the European arrest warrant. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">The right hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase> told us how thrilled he was to be sharing his birthday with his brother knights and the rest of us; the sad thing is that he was not joking. He also told us about the evidence from ACPO and its concerns about the European arrest warrant.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">The hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase> is also the Chair of a Select Committee. I am sorry that I missed his performance in the choir last night with German colleagues. He reminded us&#8212;this is a really important point&#8212;that, unlike Lisbon, the opt-ins are permanent and therefore a transfer of power. He reminded us of what the Justice Secretary, when shadow Home Secretary, told us about his views on the European arrest warrant, and of what the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary said about it, and asked whether they would now be eating their words.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40039" name="Gerald Howarth">The hon. Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth)</phrase> reminded us, and his party, of what political message it would send if we opted into all 35 measures. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40134" name="David Nuttall">The hon. Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall)</phrase> expressed his concern about the European single market morphing into a European superstate. He was particularly concerned, like many other colleagues, about the European arrest warrant, and reminded us, as have many others, of what the Prime Minister said about it previously.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/11">I must confess&#8212;I hope my Whips are not listening&#8212;that I always enjoy the speeches by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase>. His 13 minutes were magnificent. I admit that I did not agree with most of what he said, but his speech was a tour de force in terms of quality. He was confident, as only he could be, that the trappings of office would not mean that the Justice Secretary no longer espoused all the views he held on the European arrest warrant only five years ago. We will wait to see what he says in five or six minutes&#8217; time.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/12">The hon. Gentleman reminded us that we are opting into not 35 measures, but 49, and referred to the other 14. He also wondered whether people who are considering voting Conservative would have confidence in a Prime Minister and a party who went into the election promising to repatriate rights from 2015 onwards if they were giving up rights in the preceding 10 months. His message to the Prime Minister, if I understood him correctly, is that there is a danger of having a backbone in opposition but being a jellyfish in government.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40555" name="Robert Buckland">The hon. Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland)</phrase> expressed concern, as have many others, about judicial activism and too much intervention. He also pointed out that the fundamentals of British courts and justice are not necessarily threatened by the ECJ having jurisprudence.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/14">The last speech was made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40253" name="Dominic Raab">the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab)</phrase>, who has huge expertise in this area. He made four key points. He warned about a single European justice system and said that sooner or later we may end up with that destination if concerns are not expressed now. Again, he highlighted concerns about the European arrest warrant, and referred to individual cases.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/15">Six of the 35 measures relate to justice, my area of responsibility, and the Chair of the Justice Committee touched on most of them: the data protection secretariat, the data protection framework decision, the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties, prisoner transfers, the European supervision order, and trials in absentia.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/16">For the sake of brevity, I will touch on only one of those issues, namely prisoner transfers. From his time as a Minister in the previous Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for Delyn knows full well the importance of transferring foreign prisoners to their home countries to serve out their custodial sentences. He negotiated many of the agreements that are still in place. However, since 2010, only four further agreements have been negotiated by the current Government, compared with the 50 negotiated by my right hon. Friend and other colleagues in the previous Government. One in eight of those behind bars in England and Wales is a foreign national, and the Chair of the Home Affairs</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/17">Committee reminded us that the cost to the British taxpayer is &#163;300 million a year. That is why it is so important that we get this right.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/18">The Home Secretary was right to refer to the case of the Latvian prisoner who was sent back to Latvia last month, but the numbers transferred are still pitifully low. When the Justice Secretary responds, will he tell us what progress he has made in persuading other countries to take their own prisoners back from the UK? I appreciate that Poland has a derogation, but the other countries do not.</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/19">I will not refer to the measures we are not going to opt into, except to ask whether the Government are considering having impact assessments on them. That question has been asked by Members of the other place. I appreciate that we now have impact assessments on those measures that we are going to opt into, but will there be impact assessments on those that we are not going to opt into?</p>
	<p pid="c.543.2/20">Lots of colleagues have made interventions and 12 Members from both sides of the House have made speeches. They have asked many questions and I, like them, am looking forward to hearing some answers from the Justice Secretary.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.546.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40250" speakername="Chris Grayling" speakeroffice="The Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice"  colnum="546"  time="016:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0004.htm#140710-0004.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.546.0/1">This has been an important debate and I have listened very carefully to the strong opinions expressed. We have heard some passionate speeches and views. My hon. Friends the Members for Aldridge-Brownhills (Sir Richard Shepherd), for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin), for Bury North (Mr Nuttall) and for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth) set out very strongly the views they hold and their concerns about these matters. We heard some contradictory views from my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase>&#8212;I wish him a happy birthday&#8212;and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40555" name="Robert Buckland">the Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland)</phrase>, who made an important point about unlimited jurisprudence and the way in which international treaties can take us into new areas beyond the intention of those who created them. That point was also made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40253" name="Dominic Raab">the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab)</phrase> on that very important issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.546.0/2">It is always important to remember how we reached the position we are in. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> reminded us that, prior to the Lisbon treaty, these matters were all outside the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. They used to be intergovernmental matters. Of course, it was the previous Labour Government who took the decision to put us in the position we are in now. They sold us down this river in a way that should never have happened and left us in the legal position we are in today. It is really important that we as Conservatives always remember the previous Labour Government&#8217;s contribution. They accepted a treaty that was supposed to be subject to a referendum, but it never took place, and we in this House were asked to accept a package that I do not believe the British people wanted, although they were not given the opportunity to decide whether to accept it or not.</p>
	<p pid="c.546.0/3">That treaty allowed the UK to decide whether to opt out of all the pre-Lisbon justice and home affairs measures, and then to seek to rejoin any that it believed were in the national interest. That process, which we went through last year, had to be carried out en bloc, which meant that it was clunky and could not involve negotiating and debating on a measure-by-measure basis, as with new measures. But that is what the treaty provides for.</p>
	<p pid="c.546.0/4">Last year, after extensive discussions within the Government, we agreed that we would exercise that opt-out and seek to rejoin a list of 35 measures. We also agreed that as a Government we wanted to participate in measures that contributed to the fight against international crime, but did not wish to be part of those that sought to create a European justice system. As the House knows, I strongly disagree with the previous Commissioner and others in Brussels who want the creation of such a system.</p>
	<p pid="c.546.0/5">It is particularly important for us in this country to maintain the distinctiveness of our justice system, not just because of the core role it has played in our society for 800 years but, to be frank, because of the important competitive advantage it gives our legal services sector around the world. That point was well made by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton. We are not going to be, and we should not seek to become, part of a Europeanised justice system. I do not believe in such a development, and I certainly do not want this country to be part of it.</p>
	<p pid="c.546.0/6">The 35 measures we are discussing are mostly to do with international policing and the fight against international organised crime. As the Chair of the Justice Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>, pointed out, the changes made to the list have not altered the balance we discussed earlier this year. The measures are on the list because the Home Office, with its officials and those who work with them, has clearly advised the Government that they are essential to our work in fighting international crime in particular and are therefore in the national interest. That advice has formed a fundamental part of the Government&#8217;s strategy.</p>

	<p pid="c.547.0/1">I understand very well where my right hon. Friend is coming from and I think I know where he would like to go, but may I put it to him that when he speaks about not wanting to Europeanise our justice system the truth is that by acquiescing in rejoining the measures&#8212;the 35 up to 49 measures&#8212;we are submitting ourselves to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which means doing exactly that? It will Europeanise our position irrevocably, unless in due course we repeal the legislation in this House unilaterally.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-10c.547.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40250" speakername="Chris Grayling" colnum="547"  time="016:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140710/debtext/140710-0004.htm#140710-0004.htm_spnew4">
	<p pid="c.547.1/1">The Prime Minister set out some of the areas for renegotiation in his article earlier this spring. I hope and believe that a majority Conservative Government will be able to take forward such a renegotiation after the next general election, and the whole area of justice and home affairs needs to be part of that renegotiation process.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/2">After we secured Commons approval for the opt-out&#8212;I was very pleased that the opt-out was exercised last year&#8212;we left time for the Select Committees to consider the proposed list before we embarked on negotiations</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/3">with the Commission and other member states. I am acutely aware that the Select Committees said that Parliament was not involved early enough in the process, and we are now seeking to rectify that. The negotiations with the Commission reached a conclusion last month, though some matters are still outstanding in the Council and we are still to get final confirmation about the overall package. Once we reach that point, we can address the question about the process to be followed this autumn.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/4">My hon. Friend the Member for Stone asked whether there will be another debate. Yes, of course there will. It would be inconceivable to have a vote without a debate. It is worth saying that the Home Secretary and I brought forward publication of the Command Paper because we both believed that it was necessary to give Parliament a further opportunity to engage with the issue. I regret the fact that some information appeared before we could bring it to Parliament. However, that it makes it all the more necessary to ensure that Parliament has access to such information now, and that is why the Command Paper was produced and this debate is taking place. We want to give hon. Members and the Select Committees sufficient time to consider that work before we get to the last lap of this process.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/5">At this point, it is appropriate for the House to recognise the very hard work done on this issue by the Home Secretary. These were difficult negotiations, and success was by no means guaranteed. Her efforts in particular have been vital in getting us to where we are, and I am sure the House is grateful to her.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/6">As I have said, we still have to complete some areas of discussion in the Council, so I cannot say that we have finally resolved all the issues in Brussels. However, this is still the opportune and appropriate moment for Parliament to look at where we have got to. We listened very carefully to the concerns expressed earlier this year by the three Select Committee Chairs, and I hope that they feel we have done the right thing by starting the dialogue with Parliament now, even though we have yet to complete the process fully.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/7">As the House will know, the list of measures relating to my Department forms only a small part of what we are debating, but I want to touch on one measure that does not appear in the list. The House will recall that I have previously set out why we chose not to rejoin the probation measure. I explained that, to our knowledge, the measure has not yet been used, and that there are serious questions about how it might work. I do not believe that it is in our national interest to join the measure at this time and leave the European Court of Justice as the potential arbiter of such questions.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/8">The Commission and other member states, by contrast, were keen for us to rejoin the measure because they see it as part of a package that accompanies the prisoner transfer agreement. Despite that, we have said that we will not join at this time.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/9">Our concerns centre on the implications of the measure for our courts, prisons and probation system. What would happen, for example, if someone who had already been transferred breached their licence conditions? Unlike many other member states, the UK does not specify penalties for breaches of community orders or probation. The measure would allow member states to return to us the person we had extradited, but we could not do the same to them. That would place significant potential burdens on our courts and probation system.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/10">Of course, all of us are very happy to see foreign national offenders returned to their home countries. I have no principled objection to sending prisoners back to serve their probation or community sentence in their home country. However, the measure appears to have potential problems that may materialise once it is in operation.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/11">We have indicated to the Commission, as I said in our last debate on this matter, that we will take another look at the measure when there is enough evidence of it working and of its impacts to see whether there would be benefits to the UK in taking part. To support that decision, we will publish for Parliament an assessment of the potential impacts. Clearly, we will not agree to join this or any further JHA measure unless it is in our national interest to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/12">It is important to stress again that this debate has been designed to give the House an update on where we have got to and an opportunity to launch more detailed scrutiny of the process that we have gone through. It has been designed to address the concerns that were raised the last time we debated these issues in the House, which was back in April. We still have work to do in the European Council, in Brussels and in both Houses of Parliament. We will come back to this House when that work is complete. Of course, the two Departments will work closely with the relevant Select Committees to answer questions and discuss the issues in the weeks ahead.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/13">I hope and believe that the House will accept that we have done the right thing in starting this conversation today, in setting out where we have got to in the negotiations and in setting out a process that will allow the kind of scrutiny that we were challenged over earlier in the year. I hope that the three Select Committees feel that we are taking things in the right direction. We have a bit of work left to do. This has been a valuable debate. These are serious issues and the House will have to reach a conclusion about our direction on them before too long. I hope that this debate will be the start of a valuable dialogue that helps Members on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/14" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/15" class="italic">Resolved,</p>
	<p pid="c.547.1/16">That this House has considered the UK&#8217;s Justice and Home Affairs opt-outs.</p>

	<p pid="c.550.2/1">Social care is changing. All parties in this House are rightly committed to giving disabled people more choice and control over where and how they live.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.2/2">If I were to acquire a serious disability, I would hope to spend as long as possible in my own home. I would hope that the care system would provide me with high quality care that allowed me to enjoy a good quality of life close to my friends and family. That is an increasingly normal model, but it has not always been that way.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.2/3">For decades, it was conventional for most severely disabled people to move into a residential home. Today, some disabled people prefer to live in a residential home where they can be part of a community of staff, relatives and other residents. There will always be some people whose condition is severe enough to rule out other options of care.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.2/4">Residential home closures, whatever the motivation behind them, pull apart existing communities. They are people&#8217;s homes. It may be that many disabled people wish to move from their existing setting, but others do not.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.2/5">Robert Holmes is 39. I met his mother, Grace, two months ago when out knocking on doors in my constituency. She told me about the excellent quality of care that Robert, who has cerebral palsy, receives at Scope&#8217;s residential home, Hampton House in Northampton.</p>

	<p pid="c.550.3/1">Grace also told me of Scope&#8217;s proposals to close Hampton House and relocate the residents apart from one another. She said:</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/2">&#8220;All of the residents there are like brothers and sisters to Robert&#8212;and some have been there for 39 years. The staff are brilliant. Even when residents go to hospital they have a staff member with them 24-7&#8230;I felt happy knowing that if anything happened to me Robert was in a place where he was loved and cared for, but now I worry constantly about it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/3">Ann and Richard Fensome are also my constituents in Luton South. Their daughter, Joanne, is also 39. Ann and Richard report that Joanne, who has cerebral palsy and is severely disabled, does not wish to move from Wakes Hall in Essex&#8212;another Scope home earmarked for closure. They are not alone, and I thank the families who have taken time to contact my office to share their personal and emotional experiences of support for their loved ones at this time.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/4">Scope has proposed to close eight residential homes and modify another three in the coming years, but it is not alone in pursuing such proposals. We are seeing the same thing happen with the Guinness Partnership, Home Farm Trust and other smaller charities who feel that residential homes are no longer in step with the Government&#8217;s decision and direction on care provision. This debate is important because we must ask: what</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/5">about the voice of those disabled people who wish to live in such facilities, but who lose that right because of home closures? What happens when these homes no longer provide the same kind of care they would once have done? Who ultimately steps in?</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/6">I do not have one of the proposed home closures in my constituency, but I easily found families who will be profoundly affected by Scope&#8217;s decision, and in that sense I suspect that every Member in this place will be affected in some way. The two families I spoke of earlier came to Parliament last month to lobby MPs along with Labour&#8217;s parliamentary candidate for Northampton North and former Member of this House, Sally Keeble. She has been tireless in her work on this issue, but she has not been alone. Indeed, I have spoken to a number of Members from across the House who have raised their concerns directly with me.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40456" name="Michael Ellis">The hon. Member for Northampton North (Michael Ellis)</phrase>, who is in his place, has challenged the decision to consult on shutting Hampton House in his constituency. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40664" name="Priti Patel">The hon. Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase> has shared her concerns with me about the decision to consult on the closure of Wakes Hall in the nearby constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40303" name="Bernard Jenkin">the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Mr Jenkin)</phrase>, and I know that she spoke at a lobby on that issue last month. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40498" name="Nigel Evans">The hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr Evans)</phrase> and former Deputy Speaker spoke with me about his concerns for the residents affected. In my constituency office in Luton, Grace Holmes and the Fensomes highly praised Scope&#8217;s approach to care. They spoke of the quality of support that their children receive, and the relationships that they have built with the staff over the years. As an example of their gratitude for the charity&#8217;s work, they shared how they have actively supported Scope for a number of years. Perhaps that is why they are so disappointed by Scope&#8217;s proposals. They raised concerns with me about the consultation process, the upset it was causing residents, and a number of process issues. At the core of their argument, however, was the issue of choice.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/8">Peter Walker, Scope&#8217;s regional director, recently told a local newspaper that the charity was looking to close care homes such as these,</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/9">&#8220;because we don&#8217;t think this kind of old-fashioned care home offers disabled people the kind of say that everyone else has over where they live, who they live with and how their money is spent&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/10">Scope states that the closures are necessary in order to comply with the direction of Government policy, which is to encourage those with physical and learning difficulties to enjoy independent living and choice about the care they receive. I have no reason to doubt that assertion, and that Scope&#8217;s desire is to give future service users an experience that reflects their expectations. I am fully supportive of the move towards more independent living for those who believe that they will be able to lead better lives in that way. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40360" name="Liz Kendall">the Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall)</phrase>, the shadow Minister for care and older people, has similarly expressed her support for those laudable aims in correspondence with Scope&#8217;s chief executive, but for Joanne and Robert, who do not wish to move, their choice is not being enhanced; it is being taken away. I understand that they are among the most vulnerable of Scope&#8217;s clients. They are the people that the charity was set up to care for. For them, round-the-clock care does not come towards the end of their lives, and they will continue to need such care for decades to come.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/11">The Department of Health website looks towards a new system under the Care Act 2014 that will be</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/12">&#8220;built around each person&#8212;what they need, how they can best be cared for, and what they want.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/13">The tone is very purposely set to encourage patients to have more confidence in the choices available to them, yet the most important expression of choice is that of my constituents&#8212;their choice is to stay in the home that they know and love, and they want their families to be assured that their loved ones continue to receive good quality care by those whom they trust.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/14">Scope has made efforts to bring residents on board with its new strategy. Hampton House residents have had the opportunity to visit the type of independent housing that Scope envisages&#8212;small clusters of individual properties. Although that will appeal to some, the overwhelming feedback was concern. They fear that the move will result in the residents becoming more isolated, and in a loss of the easy mobility and companionship that they currently enjoy. The move will appeal to some, but we should take note of that overwhelming feedback.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/15">I would appreciate the following response from the Minister. First, I should like him to review that broad issue and report to the House. The review should set out what work the Government have done on the changing culture&#8212;the shift from residential care home settings for disabled people while at the same time preserving the rights and choices of people such as Joanne and Robert to stay in residential home settings.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/16">If the care home residents were tenants in the housing market, they would have tenure rights, exercisable through the courts. As customers of a business or clients of a charity, they can lose their homes on the whim of a change in strategy by the organisation. That could happen even in the case of Hampton House, where one resident has lived for some 39 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/17">The review should examine the issue of choice. Questions have been raised about the working of the Mental Capacity Act 2005, and about the exercising of choice by people who have profound learning difficulties. Who is best able to interpret and assist in their choices: the charity that provides their accommodation or their family members?</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/18">The review should examine the accountability of charities and the private sector. If those homes were run in the public sector, there would be a statutory requirement for public consultation. The issues and information would be public, and the results would be open to legal challenge. In the case of Hampton House, Scope has said there will be a consultation, but it has told family members verbally that that is unlikely to change the decision to close the home. The decision is not open to scrutiny or challenge in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/19">The review should also examine a national framework of safeguards. People with very complex needs require security in their housing and care arrangements throughout their lifetime, which may extend well beyond the lives of their parents or other close relatives. We know that age is a key factor in the argument. Some charities say that younger disabled people want to live independently and, anecdotally, I have been told that more independent living is a trend that is better reflected among some younger disabled people. However, that leaves us with a challenge, particularly for some older disabled people, such as those in their 40s or 50s. In some cases, the intentional communities in which they live have been</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/20">their homes for all their adult lives. The Government should examine whether their sectoral needs are being well met, and what safeguards should be appropriately awarded to them.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/21">Will the Minister review Scope&#8217;s proposed consultation and examine whether more can be done to protect the rights of disabled people who wish to live in these residential settings right now? Indeed, a number of families, accepting Scope&#8217;s position that it does not wish to continue actively supporting these institutions, ask whether facilities could be transferred to another charity to run. That would provide continuity of service. I understand that Scope&#8217;s position is that it is not an economic concern that has led it to take this route of consultation and closing homes, so it is credible to believe that another organisation could absorb them.</p>
	<p pid="c.550.3/22">I do not doubt the Minister&#8217;s sincerity in seeking to move to a care system where disabled people have greater choice, voice and control over their own lives. It would, however, be the greatest of ironies if, in undertaking such a shift, we were to leave a generation or a group of severely disabled people behind.</p>

	<p pid="c.553.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40380" name="Gavin Shuker">the hon. Member for Luton South (Gavin Shuker)</phrase> on securing this debate. I am grateful to him, and to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for permitting me to contribute to this important Adjournment debate, as the regular proceedings do not normally allow for that. The hon. Gentleman spoke very well and advocated his position very effectively. I agree with much of what he said.</p>
	<p pid="c.553.0/2">I admire Scope, as I am sure the hon. Member for Luton South does. It is an excellent charity and its staff do wonderful work. They clearly care about the people in their charge, for whom they are duty bound to care. Hampton House, in my constituency, should not close. It should not close for the very reason that it is not an institution, but a home for more than a dozen people. We are told that this is not about economics, Government policy or local authority decisions; it is a policy shift. There has been a decision to move away from a residential setting to more of a care home setting. This may well work in many cases&#8212;the hon. Gentleman alluded to them&#8212;especially for those who are disabled who are entering this kind of care arrangement, but it does not work, and is not working, for those who have lived in Hampton House in my constituency for literally decades, and in one case nearly four decades.</p>
	<p pid="c.553.0/3">In the very short time allowed to me in this instance, I want to put on record my suggestion that we work together with Scope to find an alternative to its proposal to close Hampton House, and ask it to please look again and please think again. Those who have lived there for decades are firmly wedded to its atmosphere, staff and ambience&#8212;to everything about home&#8212;as you or I, Madam Deputy Speaker, would be. There must be alternatives.</p>

	<p pid="c.553.1/1">The point is that the sense of community is being destroyed. Whatever arrangement we come to with Scope, we have to find a way of keeping that sense of community for the people who want to keep it.</p>

	<p pid="c.554.0/1">I agree: it is a sense of community and a sense of belonging. It is very easy for those outside that community to think that this is an institution that needs change&#8212;that we need to modernise and move forward. There may be&#8212;indeed, there is&#8212;room for such modernisation and moving forward in many cases, but not in every case and not by taking a broad-brush approach. There must be alternatives. I would respectfully ask Scope to work with us across the political divide and with the residents. Let us find an alternative.</p>

	<p pid="c.554.1/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40380" name="Gavin Shuker">the hon. Member for Luton South (Gavin Shuker)</phrase> for securing this debate and for speaking in a reasonable tone about issues of enormous concern to some of his constituents. I very much noted the fact that they have told him that they have experienced good care. They regard the care home as their home. In a way, that demonstrates the conflict that sometimes arises, in that there is a general trend towards more people wanting to live in their own communities with support, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said. He described his sense that he would want to remain in his own home were he to be disabled, but at the same time there are those who regard a care home as their home and they have no desire to change that. It is right to recognise that that conflict exists, and it creates a dilemma.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/2">The hon. Gentleman suggested that, in a way, Scope was closing the home because of Government policy. Government policy, as enshrined in the Care Act 2014, is to put people in charge&#8212;to focus on well-being, which is the central theme of the Care Act. As far as possible, it should be the individual who determines where they want to be. I have spoken to Richard Hawkes, the chief executive of Scope. Scope is very clear that this is its decision: it wants to do it and is doing so for what it regards as a good purpose. However, the Government&#8217;s focus is simply on the individual&#8212;on ensuring that, as far as possible, we enable people to make the decision that is right for them, recognising, however, the conflict that can arise.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/3">Care homes often look after some very frail people, but also individuals with quite complex needs. It is understandable and reasonable that, should there be a possibility of a care home closing, residents and their families will be extremely concerned about the future, particularly with the upheaval of having to move. It will inevitably be an unsettling and potentially stressful time. The decision to close a care home voluntarily is taken by the owner or operator&#8212;either the local council, where that remains the case, or, if it is an independent home, the proprietor, whether the home is in the private or the voluntary sector. Of the approximately 17,000 care and nursing homes in England these days, over 90% are in the independent sector&#8212;that has been the case for many years&#8212;and are owned and operated by private companies or charitable and voluntary sector organisations such as Scope.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/4">Homes may close for a variety of reasons, including lack of financial viability and/or insufficient demand for places, retirement of the owners, the sale of premises for alternative use and even the de-registration of unsuitable or unsafe services as a result of the Care Quality Commission&#8217;s intervention. In the case of Scope, the organisation is looking to redesign the services it provides</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/5">to support people. It is important that people who need care and support are accommodated in appropriate settings that are based, critically, on their choice as far as possible. It is clearly not desirable if someone has to move from a care home where they are settled and happy and where their needs are being met.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/6">Local authorities have a responsibility, through good commissioning strategies, to ensure a healthy local care home sector. Through the Care Act 2014, which will come into force next April, we are giving local authorities a core duty to promote their local care market, with a particular focus on ensuring diversity, quality and sustainability. Importantly, they should ensure that sufficient high-quality services are available to meet the needs of individuals in their local area. However, although local authorities should make all reasonable efforts to ensure that good care homes remain viable and stay open, there will be situations where homes have to close or where the proprietors choose to close them. We have to face this. What is most important is that any decision to close a home should be handled sensitively and appropriately. It is essential that person-centred care planning identifies the best possible alternative for each individual. Adequate time should be allowed for the process, so that residents and their relatives can be properly involved and be given plenty of time to make decisions and arrangements in a way that minimises stress.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/7">I must emphasise that, should a home have to close, local authorities have a statutory duty to arrange suitable alternative accommodation for those residents who are assessed as being in need of residential care, so it should never be the case that someone who needs residential care will not be provided with it. I fully appreciate, however, that that does not reassure someone who regards a particular building and set of care workers as their home and their home environment.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/8">I am aware that some providers of residential care for disabled people&#8212;including the charity for disabled people, Scope&#8212;are reviewing their residential services and are consulting users of services and their families. I appreciate, as I have said, that this can be an extraordinarily worrying time and a stressful situation both for the people in those homes and for their families. Parents of adult disabled people are often themselves quite elderly, which can cause additional stress. The hon. Gentleman touched on that when he talked about his constituent. I would encourage the residents and their families fully to engage with the consultation process and ensure that their views are taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/9">Scope has given an assurance to the Department of Health that it is committed to ensuring that all users of its services who may be affected are properly consulted and supported. It has promised to provide any individual who needs it with advocacy so that every resident of its homes can understand what the proposals mean for them and can make it clear what they want for the future. Richard Hawkes told me that Scope has even provided care workers to come down to Parliament to support people who were lobbying their MPs against the closures. It says that it has tried to be as reasonable as possible. This process will not, Scope says, be rushed or hurried. It has informed the Department that the consultation will take place over a period of three years.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/10">Scope runs many other care homes that will remain open. There is a particular focus on the larger care homes, but there are also many smaller care homes that</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/11">it intends to keep open&#8212;eight of them, as I think the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Scope appreciates that many residents are happy in its homes, but has to face the fact that there is a lessening demand for large, traditional residential care services.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/12">Richard Hawkes as chief executive, made the point to me that more people are taking on personal budgets&#8212;a concept substantially and rightly developed under the previous Government and one that is continued by this Government and now legislated for in the Care Act 2014. The concept was designed to put the individual in charge, so that they can determine how the money available for their care is spent to meet their particular priorities. As people take on personal budgets, according to Richard Hawkes, they are increasingly voting with their feet and choosing not to go into larger care homes, which often have long corridors, shared bathrooms and so forth. They are increasingly choosing to remain in supported living if possible with a package of care built around their individual needs. Scope is reviewing its services now, so that decisions can be made and, if need be, homes closed in a controlled, planned manner before vacancy levels make them unviable.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/13">Richard Hawkes also told me about an experience that Scope has been through in Southampton. It proposed to close a care home, leading to the same totally legitimate anxieties and concerns. It went through the process and all the individuals in the home have been relocated in circumstances that suit those individuals, with their having a central say in where they are going to go. He tells me&#8212;I base my comments just on what he says&#8212;that all now appear to be happier with their new circumstances and are finding a new sense of freedom that they did not experience in the past. Although these changes to circumstances can be traumatic and difficult, the end-result, as demonstrated in the experience of Southampton, can sometimes be a good one for the individuals involved. I realise, though, that elderly parents in particular will sometimes find that quite hard to recognise.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/14">It is worth taking a moment to look at the history of this issue. Many traditional, large residential care homes are quite old now. A number of Scope&#8217;s homes date back to the 1970s. They were developed in&#8212;and designed to suit the needs and demands of&#8212;a different era. By modern standards, they lack privacy, and they do not allow residents the degree of freedom, choice and control that we rightly expect and demand nowadays. As a result, many Scope homes are under-occupied. The increasing availability of new models and types of care, support and accommodation means that traditional large care homes are no longer the default or only option when it comes to providing care and support for people with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/15">Innovations and developments in supported living, and the various types of housing with care that are available these days, offer disabled people far more choice than they ever had in the past, and control over their lives. I am sure that, ultimately, we should all welcome that. Scope has informed us that, owing to the newer options that have become available, local authorities do not automatically make routine new placements in residential care, and it expects the number of empty places in its older homes to continue to rise. In the long term, it can only be a good thing that people have so many more choices when it comes to the care that is</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/16">available to them, but, as I have said, I entirely appreciate that, as with any change, the process is not without its short-term challenges.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/17">The Government want to give people more control over their health and social care services, and, therefore, over their lives. That is the central ambition of the Care Act. Personalisation means building support around individuals and providing more choice, control and flexibility in the way in which they receive care and support, regardless of the setting in which they receive it. There is no central policy, incidentally, that says care homes are bad: absolutely not. It is a question of what is right for the individual involved.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/18">The Care Act provides a new legislative focus on personalisation, increasing opportunities for greater choice, control and independence, so that people can choose the services that are best suited to meet their care and support needs. The Act provides that adults who are eligible for care and support must receive services that</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/19">meet their individual needs. It also requires that they must be involved in care planning. Some, of course, will need and benefit from residential care. There will always be an important job for care homes to do. However, for others a different model of care may now be more appropriate to their needs, and, most importantly, to their aspirations and desire to lead the sort of independent life that all the rest of us take for granted.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/20">We are committed to ensuring that people who wish and are able to live in their communities are given the support that they need in order to do so. Everyone, especially younger adults&#8212;including those with a learning disability&#8212;should have the opportunity to make informed choices about where and with whom they live, and to have greater choice and control over their lives and support to help them to lead a fulfilling life of their own.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/21" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="c.554.1/22" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
