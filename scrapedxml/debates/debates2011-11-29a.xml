	<p pid="a.779.12/1">It is not very secure. We absolutely agree with the Turkish Government. Indeed, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister called in August for President Assad to step aside. We believe that the regime has lost all legitimacy, certainly in the eyes of the world, but clearly in the eyes of millions of its own people as well. So the regime should now understand that it has no future, that democracy should be introduced in Syria, and the regime should leave office.</p>

	<p pid="a.780.1/1">There is no doubt that Iran has been involved in trying to prop up the Syrian regime. Iran is a country that has supported popular revolution in other parts of the middle east but then has been happy to collude in trying to repress such revolution in Syria&#8212;its ally. It has helped with technical equipment, expertise and advice on how to help the regime to deal with the situation, and it shows a hypocritical approach to events in the middle east.</p>

	<p pid="a.780.2/1">Turkey is a vital ally of the United Kingdom and, indeed, the European Union. What discussions did the Prime Minister have with the Turkish President last week on what further specific measures Turkey can take to exert additional pressure on the Syrian Government?</p>

	<p pid="a.780.3/1">We discussed this at some length&#8212;the Prime Minister with the President&#8212;and I discussed it with the Turkish Foreign Minister in the margins of the state visit. We are all working closely&#8212;Turkey and the European Union nations&#8212;with the Arab League. Turkey is considering a range of measures that it could take on Syria, but, as the hon. Lady knows, the Arab League has led the way at the moment in announcing sanctions. I would not be surprised if further measures now follow from Turkey, on the basis of the discussions that we had last week.</p>

	<p pid="a.780.4/1">I very much welcome the EU sanctions and, indeed, those from the Arab League, particularly in the light of the very grim UN report, showing that Syrian Government forces have killed at least 256 children. Following the recent visit to London by Syrian opposition representatives, what more can the UK and our EU partners do to support the development of a cohesive and peaceful political opposition in Syria?</p>

	<p pid="a.780.5/1">Cohesive and peaceful are two very important words. I met two separate groupings of the Syrian opposition last week: the Syrian National Council and the national co-ordinating body&#8212;a different grouping of the opposition. I encouraged them to find a common and cohesive platform together&#8212;at this extreme moment in their nation&#8217;s history, it is important for them to work together&#8212;and to maintain non-violent resistance to the Assad regime, to maintain their support around the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.780.8/1">I have had a number of recent meetings with representatives of British business who have emphasised the immediate need for eurozone countries to act to restore stability to their currency and the need for the entire European Union to adopt policies to encourage growth and job creation through open markets and less-costly regulation.</p>

	<p pid="a.781.1/1">My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer made it quite clear at the most recent ECOFIN meeting that we would reject an EU financial transfer tax, and he was supported in his opposition by 11 other member states.</p>

	<p pid="a.781.3/1">I have discussed this in the past two weeks with senior members of the Commission, and I have encouraged them to introduce measures under the Single European Act. Yesterday, in Berlin, other Ministers and I talked to our German counterparts about joint action both to deepen the single market and to reduce the cost of regulations, especially for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

	<p pid="a.781.4/1">What discussions has the Minister had with his continental cousins about the fact that the euro is burning while Brussels is fiddling? Would it not be much better to have an orderly withdrawal from the euro, rather than the crisis that we have at the moment?</p>

	<p pid="a.781.5/1">I think, as my hon. Friend would admit in private, the idea that the eurozone can somehow be dismantled in an orderly manner is rather far-fetched. The collapse of the euro and a prolonged recession in the eurozone would do profound damage to hopes for growth and job creation in the United Kingdom. It is our largest single trading partner.</p>

It is not a NATO conference, for example, and we hope that it will be possible for Pakistan to send representatives, as its future security is intimately bound up with that of Afghanistan.</p>

We have made representations over a lengthy period to the Government of Afghanistan to ensure that their own delegation includes a significant number of women representatives, which it will do, and they will voice their aspirations. Our delegation has also ensured that those issues are well up on the agenda, and it is important that the advances made by women in recent years, including that of 2.5 million girls now going to school, are not knocked backwards.</p>

	<p pid="a.787.7/1">Yes, of course. There are many dangers in a nuclear-armed Iran, the prime one being that Iran is a signatory to the non-proliferation treaty, that it would be a great breach of that treaty, and that nuclear proliferation throughout the middle east might then multiply greatly and become a threat to the peace of that region and to the world. The hon. Gentleman is also correct to argue, however, that a nuclear-armed Iran could feel in a stronger position to pursue other activities that were against the peace and the human rights of other countries in the region.</p>

Those countries have certainly played their part in this. It is true, however, that they are not currently in favour of further tightening of the sanctions regime on Iran.

	<p pid="a.791.8/1">We are clear that more needs to be done on Gaza. Israel&#8217;s decision to move from a list of 120 permitted goods to a list of specific prohibited items was a positive step, but there has been no fundamental change in the crossings regime or in the economic stagnation of Gaza. We are working alongside our colleagues in the European Union to try to achieve some real changes on the</p>

We are very clear about that and have condemned recent decisions to accelerate settlement building, and I condemn them again today. That is a mistake by Israel, which does not bring peace any closer or help us arrive at a two-state solution. The right approach for Israel now is to embrace the negotiations of which I have spoken, and to do so in a decisive and generous spirit.</p>

The UK and Colombia signed a joint statement on human rights during the president&#8217;s visit, so we never underestimate the importance of this issue.

	Autumn Statement
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.799.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40599" speakername="George Osborne" speakeroffice="The Chancellor of the Exchequer"  colnum="799"  time="012:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0001.htm#11112951002190">
	<p pid="a.799.1/1">Let me start by placing squarely before the House of Commons and the British public the economic situation facing our country. Much of Europe now appears to be heading into a recession caused by a chronic lack of confidence in the ability of countries to deal with their debt. We will do whatever it takes to protect Britain from this debt storm while doing all we can&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i>&#8212;all we can to build the foundations of future growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/2">Today we set out how we will do that by demonstrating that the country has the will to live within its means and keep interest rates low; by acting to stimulate the supply of money and credit to ensure that those low interest rates are passed on to families and businesses; by matching our determination on the deficit with an active enterprise policy for business and lasting investment in our infrastructure and education so that Britain can pay its way in the future; and at every opportunity by helping families with the cost of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/3">The central forecast that we publish today from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility does not predict a recession here in Britain, but it has unsurprisingly revised down its short-term growth prospects for our country, for Europe and for the world. It expects gross domestic product in Britain to grow this year by 0.9% and by 0.7% next year. It then forecasts 2.1% growth in 2013; 2.7% in 2014; followed by 3% in 2015 and 3% again in 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/4">The OBR is clear that this central forecast assumes that</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/5">&#8220;the euro area finds a way through the current crisis and that policymakers eventually find a solution that delivers sovereign debt sustainability&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/6">If they do not, the OBR warns that there could be a &#8220;much worse outcome&#8221; for Britain. I believe that it is right. We hope that this can be averted, but if the rest of Europe heads into recession, it may prove hard to avoid one here in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/7">We are now undertaking extensive contingency planning to deal with all potential outcomes of the euro crisis. Like the Bank of England and the OECD yesterday, the OBR cites the chilling effect of the current instability as one of the central reasons for the reduction in its growth forecast. I want to thank Robert Chote and his fellow committee members, Stephen Nickell and Graham Parker, and their team for the rigorous work that they have done. Their forecast today demonstrates beyond any doubt their independence, but&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> This is an important point for the House. If we accept their numbers, we must also pay heed to their analysis. In addition to the eurozone crisis, the OBR gives two further reasons for the weaker forecasts. The first is what it calls the &#8220;external inflation shock&#8221;&#8212;the result, in its words, of</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/8">&#8220;unexpected rises in energy prices and global agricultural commodity prices&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.1/9">The OBR&#8217;s analysis&#8212;independent&#8212;is that this explains the slow-down in growth in Britain over the past 18 months. Secondly, the independent OBR&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.800.1/1">Secondly, the OBR today has shown new evidence that an even bigger component of the growth that preceded the financial crisis was an unsustainable boom, and that the bust was deeper and had an even greater impact on our economy than previously thought. The result of that analysis is that the OBR has significantly reduced its assumptions about spare capacity in our economy and the trend rate of growth. That increases the OBR&#8217;s estimate of the proportion of the deficit that is structural&#8212;in other words, the part of the deficit that does not disappear even when the economy recovers. Our debt challenge is therefore even greater than we thought, because the boom was even bigger and the bust even deeper, and the effects will last even longer. Britain has had the highest structural budget deficit of any major economy in the world and the highest deficit in the entire history of our country outside war&#8212;and the last Government left it to this Government to sort that mess out.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/2">The OBR&#8217;s analysis feeds directly through to borrowing numbers that are falling, but not at the rate that had been forecast. In 2009-10, the last Government were borrowing &#163;156 billion a year. During the first year of this Government, that fell to &#163;137 billion. This year the OBR expects it to fall again, to &#163;127 billion, then to &#163;120 billion next year, followed by &#163;100 billion in 2013-14, &#163;79 billion in 2014-15, then &#163;53 billion in 2015-16 and &#163;24 billion a year by 2016-17. However, I can report that because of the lower market interest rates that we have secured for Britain, debt interest payments over the Parliament are forecast to be &#163;22 billion less than predicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/3">The House might also like to know, given the economic events described by the Office for Budget Responsibility, what would have happened to borrowing without the action that this Government have taken. The Treasury today estimates that borrowing by 2014-15 would have been running at well over&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="a.800.2/1">Order. I am sorry, I know that the Chancellor is proceeding, but his statement must be heard. There are strong passions on this subject.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.800.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40599" speakername="George Osborne" colnum="800"  time="012:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0001.htm#11112951002194">
	<p pid="a.800.3/1">The Treasury today estimates that borrowing by 2014-15 would have been running at well over &#163;100 billion a year more and that Britain would have borrowed an additional &#163;100 billion in total over the period. If we had pursued that path, we would now be in the centre of the sovereign debt storm.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/2">The crisis we see unfolding in Europe has not undermined the case for the difficult decisions we have taken; it has made that case stronger. We held our deficit-reduction Budget on our terms last year, not on the market&#8217;s terms this year, as so many others have been forced to. In that Budget we set out a tough fiscal mandate: that we would eliminate the current structural deficit over the five-year forecast horizon. We supplemented the mandate with a fixed debt target: that we would get national debt as a proportion of national income falling</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/3">by 2015-16. To be cautious, I set plans to meet both those budget rules one year early. That headroom has now disappeared, but I am clear that our rules must be adhered to, and I am taking action to ensure that they are. As a result, the OBR&#8217;s central projection is that we will meet both the fiscal mandate and the debt target.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/4">The current structural deficit is forecast to fall from 4.6% of GDP this year to become a current structural surplus of 0.5% in five years&#8217; time, and the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is forecast to stand at 67% this year, is now set to peak at 78% in 2014-15 and to be falling by the end of the current Parliament. So borrowing is falling, and debt will come down. It is not happening as quickly as we wished, because of the damage done to our economy by the ongoing financial crisis, but we are set to meet our budget rules, and we are going to see Britain through the debt storm.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/5">There is a suggestion from some in the House that if you spend more, you will borrow less. That is something-for-nothing economics, and the House should know the risks that we would be running. Last April, the absence of a credible deficit plan meant that our country&#8217;s credit rating was on negative outlook and our market interest rates were higher than Italy&#8217;s; 18 months later, we are the only major western country whose credit rating has improved. Italy&#8217;s interest rates are now 7.2%, and what are ours? They are less than 2.5%. Yesterday we were even borrowing money more cheaply than Germany. Those who would put all that at risk by deliberately adding to our deficit must explain this.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/6">Just a 1% rise in our market interest rates would add &#163;10 billion to mortgage bills every year: 1% would mean that the average family with a mortgage would have to pay &#163;1,000 more; 1% would increase the cost of business loans by &#163;7 billion; 1% would force taxpayers to find an extra &#163;21 billion in debt interest payments, much of it going to our foreign creditors. In other words, 1% dwarfs any extra Government spending or tax cut funded by borrowing that people propose today&#8212;and that is the cost of just a 1% rise. Italy&#8217;s rates have gone up by almost 3% in the last year alone. We will not take this risk with the solvency of the British economy and the security of British families.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/7">The current environment requires us to take further action on debt to ensure that Britain continues to live within its means. This is what we propose to do. First, there is no need to adjust the overall totals set out in the spending review. Taken all together, the measures that I will set out today require no extra borrowing and provide no extra savings across the whole spending review period. Secondly, I am announcing significant savings in current spending to make the fiscal position more sustainable in the medium and long term; but in the short term&#8212;over the next three years&#8212;we will use these savings to fund capital investments in infrastructure, regional growth and education, as well as help for young people to find work. Every pound spent in this way will be paid for by a pound saved permanently. That includes savings from further restraint on public sector pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/8">For some work forces the two-year pay freeze will be coming to an end next spring, and for most it will be coming to an end during 2013. In the current circumstances, the country cannot afford the 2% rise assumed by some Government Departments thereafter, so instead we will</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/9">set public sector pay awards at an average of 1% for each of the two years after the pay freeze ends. Many people are helped by pay progression&#8212;the annual increases in salary grades to which many are entitled even when pay is frozen. That is one of the reasons why public sector pay has risen at twice the rate of private sector pay over the last four years. While I accept that a 1% average rise is tough, it is also fair to those who work to pay the taxes that will fund it. I can also announce that we are asking the independent pay review bodies to consider how public sector pay can be made more responsive to local labour markets, and we will ask them to report back by July next year. This is a significant step towards the creation of a more balanced economy in the regions of our country which does not squeeze out the private sector. Mr Speaker</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/10" class="italic">&#8212;[Interruption.]</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/11">Departmental budgets will be adjusted in line with the pay rises I have announced, with the exception of the NHS and school budgets, where the money saved will be retained in order to protect those budgets in real terms. This policy will save over &#163;1 billion in current spending by 2014-15.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/12">The deal we offer on public sector pensions is also fair to both taxpayers and public servants. The reforms are based on the independent report of John Hutton, a former Labour Pensions Secretary, and he says:</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/13">&#8220;It is hard to imagine a better deal&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/14">than this. I would once again ask the unions why they are damaging our economy at a time like this and putting jobs at risk. I say call off the strikes tomorrow, come back to the table, complete the negotiations and let us agree generous pensions that are affordable to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/15">Let me turn to other areas of public spending, starting with overseas aid. This Government will stick by the commitments they have made to the poorest people in the world by increasing our international development budget&#8212;and the whole House should be proud of the help our country is providing to eradicate disease, save lives and educate children&#8212;but the spending plans of the Department for International Development meant that the UK was on course to exceed 0.7% of national income in 2013. That I do not think can be justified and so we are adjusting those plans so we do not overshoot the target.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/16">Turning to welfare payments, the annual increase in the basic state pension is protected by the triple lock introduced by this Government. This guarantees a rise either in line with earnings, prices or 2.5%, whichever is greater. It means that the basic state pension will next April rise by &#163;5.30 to &#163;107.45&#8212;the largest ever cash rise in the basic state pension and a commitment of fairness to those who have worked hard all their lives. I wanted to make sure that poorer pensioners did not see a smaller rise in their income, so I can confirm today that we will also uprate the pension credit by &#163;5.35 and pay for that with an increase in the threshold for the savings credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/17">I also want to protect those who are not able to work because of their disabilities and those who, through no fault of their own, have lost jobs and are trying to find work, so I can confirm that we will uprate working-age benefits in line with September&#8217;s consumer prices index inflation number of 5.2%. That will be a significant boost to the incomes of the poorest, especially when inflation is forecast to be considerably less than that by</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/18">next April. We will also uprate with prices the disability elements of tax credits, and increase the child element of the child tax credit by &#163;135 in line with inflation too. But we will not uprate the other elements of the working tax credit this coming year; and given the size of the uprating this year, we will no longer go ahead with the additional &#163;110 rise in the child element, over and above inflation, that was planned. By April 2012, the child tax credit will have increased by &#163;390 since the coalition came into power. The best way to support low-income working people is to take them out of tax altogether, and our increases in the income tax personal allowance this year and next will do that for over 1 million people.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/19">Let me turn to future public spending. Today, I am setting expenditure totals for the two years following the end of the spending review period: 2015-16 and 2016-17. Total managed expenditure will fall during that period by 0.9% a year in real terms&#8212;the same rate as set out for the existing period of the spending review, with a baseline that excludes the additional investments in infrastructure also announced today. These are large savings and we will set out in future how resources will be allocated between different areas of government.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/20">I am also announcing a measure to control spending which is not for today or next year, or even for the next decade, but it directly addresses the long-term challenge Britain and so many other countries face with an ageing population. Our generation has been warned that the costs of providing decent state pensions are going to become more and more unaffordable unless we take further action.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/21">Let us not leave it to our children to take emergency action to rescue the public finances; let us think ahead and take responsible, sensible steps now. Starting in 2026, we will increase the state pension age from 66 to 67, so that we can go on paying a decent pension to people who are living longer. Australia, America and Germany have all taken similar steps. This will not affect anyone within 14 years of receiving their state pension today. By saving a staggering &#163;59 billion, it will mean a long-term future for the basic state pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/22">We are showing a world that is sceptical that democratic western Governments can take tough decisions that Britain will pay its way in the world. That is the first thing that the Government can do in the current environment: keep our interest rates low and protect our country from the worst of the debt storm. But we need to make sure that those low interest rates are available to families and to businesses. It is monetary and credit policy that is, in a debt crisis, the principal and most powerful tool for stimulating demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/23">Last month, the Bank of England&#8217;s Monetary Policy Committee decided to undertake further quantitative easing, and I have authorised an increase in the ceiling on its asset purchases to &#163;275 billion. This will support demand across the economy, but we must do more to help those small businesses who cannot get access to credit at an affordable price.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/24">We have already extended the last Government&#8217;s enterprise finance guarantee scheme, and we are today expanding it to include businesses with annual turnovers of up to &#163;44 million and accrediting new lenders, such as Metro Bank. But this scheme is by itself not nearly ambitious enough and never will be within the constraints of state aid rules, so the Government are launching a</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/25">major programme of credit easing to help small business. We have set a ceiling of &#163;40 billion. At the same time, I have agreed with Mervyn King that we will reduce by &#163;40 billion the asset purchase facility that the previous Government gave the Bank to buy business loans. Only a small proportion of the facility was ever used. I am publishing my exchange of letters with the Governor today.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/26">We are launching our national loan guarantee scheme. It will work on the simple principle that we use the hard-won low interest rates that the Government can borrow at to reduce the interest rates at which small businesses can borrow. We are using the credibility that we have earned in the international markets to help our domestic economy. New loans and overdrafts to businesses with a turnover of less than &#163;50 million will be eligible for the scheme, so that it stays focused on smaller companies. We expect that it will lead to reductions of 1 percentage point in the rate of interest being charged to these companies, so a business facing a 7% interest rate to get a &#163;5 million loan could instead see its rate reduced to 6% and its interest costs fall by up to &#163;50,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/27">We have developed with the Bank of England a mechanism to allocate funding to different banks based on how much they increase both net and gross lending to firms. There will be a clear audit trail to ensure the banks comply, for we will use the experience of the European Investment Bank&#8217;s loans for SMEs programme here in the UK to ensure that it works. We are getting state aid approval, so that the national loan guarantee scheme will be up and running in the next few months. Initially, &#163;20 billion-worth of these guarantees will be available over the next two years. Alongside it, we are also launching a &#163;1 billion business finance partnership. That is aimed at Britain&#8217;s mid-sized companies&#8212;a crucial part of our economy, neglected for too long and now identified by the CBI director general and others as a future source of growth. The Government will invest in funds that lend directly to these businesses, in partnership with other investors such as pension funds and insurance companies. It will give these mid-cap companies a new source of investment outside the traditional banks.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/28">If the business finance partnership takes off, I stand ready to increase its size; and we will develop further partnerships ideas and ideas for new bond issuance to help Britain&#8217;s small and medium-sized companies. No Government have attempted anything as ambitious as this before. We will not get every detail perfect first time round, but we do not want to make the best the enemy of the good. With the strain on the financial system increasing, the important thing is to get credit flowing to Britain&#8217;s small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/29">The Government can use the low interest rates that we have secured to help young families, too, who want to buy a home but cannot afford the very large deposits that banks are now demanding. We will use mortgage indemnities to help 100,000 such families to buy newly built homes. We will also help construction firms that cannot get bank finance with a &#163;400 million fund that will kick-start projects that already have planning permission; and we are going to reinvigorate the right to buy. This was one of the greatest social policies of all time. It brought home ownership within the reach of millions of aspiring families. It was slowly and stealthily strangled by the last Government, as discounts were cut</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/30">and cut again. We will bring it back to life. Families in social housing will be able to buy their own homes at a discount of up to 50%. We will use the receipts to build, for every home purchased, a new additional affordable home&#8212;so new homes for families who need them; new home ownership for families who aspire to it; and new jobs in the construction industry, so that we get Britain building. That is what our new right to buy will bring.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/31">In the years leading up to the crash, our economy became dangerously over-dependent on the success of a poorly regulated City of London. Meanwhile, employment by businesses in a region such as the west midlands actually fell. By 2007, the previous Government were relying on finance for &#163;1 in every &#163;8 raised in taxation. That left Britain completely exposed when the banks failed, and I can confirm that, next month, we will publish our response to the report that we commissioned from John Vickers to protect taxpayers better.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/32">It is this Government&#8217;s policy to ensure that we remain the home of global banks and that London is the world&#8217;s pre-eminent financial centre. That is why we will not agree to the introduction of an EU financial transaction tax. It is not a tax on bankers; it is a tax on people&#8217;s pensions. Instead, we have introduced a permanent bank levy to make sure that the banks pay their fair share. I have always said that we wished to raise &#163;2.5 billion each and every year from this levy. To ensure we do that, I need to raise the rate of the levy to 0.088%. That will be effective from l January next year. We will also take action to stop some large firms using complex asset-backed pension funding arrangements to claim double the amount of tax relief that was intended. This will save the Exchequer almost &#163;500 million pounds a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/33">Financial services will always be a very important industry for the UK, but we have to help other parts of the private sector in other parts of the country to grow. That means uncongested roads and railways for businesses to move products that cannot be reduced to a screen on a City trading floor. It means providing secure power sources at reasonable prices. It means creating new superfast digital networks for companies across our country. These do not exist today. If we look at what countries such as China or Brazil are building, we see why we risk falling behind the rest of the world. So today we are publishing the national infrastructure plan. For the first time, we are identifying over 500 infrastructure projects that we want to see built over the next decade and beyond: roads, railways, airport capacity, power stations, waste facilities and broadband networks. We are mobilising the finance needed to deliver them, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/34">The savings that I have announced in the current Budget have enabled me today to fund, pound for pound, &#163;5 billion of additional public spending on infrastructure over the next three years. New spending by Network Rail, guaranteed by the Government, will bring &#163;1 billion more. We are committing a further &#163;5 billion to future projects in the next spending period, so that the planning can start now. This is public money. By exploring guarantees and letting city mayors borrow against future tax receipts, we are looking for new ways to deploy it. But we need to put to work the many billions of pounds that British people save in British</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/35">pension funds and get those savings invested in British projects. You could call it British savings for British jobs, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/36">The Government have negotiated an agreement with two groups of British pension funds to unlock an additional &#163;20 billion of private investment in modern infrastructure. We can today give the go-ahead around the country to 35 new road and rail schemes that support economic development. In the north-west, we will electrify the trans-Pennine express between Manchester and Leeds, build the Manchester airport and Crewe link roads and work with Merseyside to turn the vision of the Atlantic gateway into reality. In Yorkshire and Humber, there will be new stations and new tram capacity, and we will halve the tolls on the Humber bridge. I want to pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart) and for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy), and indeed other local MPs who have campaigned for years to make this happen. Under this Government it has.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/37">In the north-east, we will bring forward investment on the Tyne and Wear Metro. In the midlands, the A45, the A43, the A453, the Kettering bypass, the Ml and M6 will all be improved. In the south-west, the Bristol link road and the A380 bypass will go ahead. For families across the south-west facing the highest water charges in Britain, the Government will cut the household bills of all South West Water customers by &#163;50 a year. In the east of England, we are going to make immediate improvements to the Al4. In the south-east, we will build a new railway link between Oxford, Milton Keynes and Bedford that will create 12,000 new jobs. We are going to start working on a new crossing of the lower Thames, and we will explore all the options for maintaining the UK&#8217;s aviation hub status, with the exception of a third runway at Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/38">Here in London, we will work with the Mayor on options for other new river crossings, for example at Silvertown. We are going to support the extension of the Northern line to Battersea, which could bring 25,000 jobs to the area. Devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will get their Barnett share, and we are working with them to improve the links between our nations, such as the M4 in south Wales and the overnight rail service to north of the border.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/39">This all amounts to a huge commitment to overhauling the physical infrastructure of our nation. We will match it by overhauling the digital infrastructure, too. The Government are funding plans to bring superfast broadband to 90% of homes and businesses across the country, and extend mobile phone coverage to 99% of families. This will help to create a living, economically vibrant countryside.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/40">Our great cities are at the heart of our regional economies, and we will help bring world-leading, superfast broadband and wifi connections to 10 of them, including the capitals of all four nations. We will go ahead with the 22 enterprise zones already announced, plus two further zones in Humber and Lancashire confirmed today. I can also confirm that capital allowances of 100% will be available to encourage manufacturing and other industries into the zones in Liverpool, Sheffield, the Tees valley, Humber and the black country. Those allowances will also be available to the north-eastern enterprise zone, and we will consider extending to the</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/41">port of Blyth to create new private sector jobs there, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/42" class="italic">[</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/43" class="italic">Interruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/44" class="italic">]</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/45">This Government&#8217;s new regional growth fund for England has already allocated &#163;1.4 billion to 169 projects around the country. For every one pound we are putting in, we are attracting six pounds of private sector money alongside it. I am today putting a further &#163;1 billion over this Parliament into the regional growth fund for England, with support as well for the devolved Administrations. If we do not get the private sector to take a greater share of economic activity in the regions, our economy will become more and more unbalanced, as it did over the last 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/46">Government should not assume that this will happen by itself. We must help businesses to grow and succeed, and we can do that at a national level too, with our commitment, for example, to British science. At a time of difficult choices, we made ours last year when we committed to protect the science budget. Today we are confirming almost half a billion pounds for scientific projects, from supercomputing and satellite technology to a world-beating animal health laboratory, and Government can encourage many more of our small firms to export overseas for the first time. We are doubling to 50,000 the number of SMEs we are helping, and extending support to British mid-caps, who sometimes lack the overseas ambition of their German equivalents.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/47">We will make it easier for UK-based firms to compete for Government procurement contracts and make new applications out of government data. We will provide funds for smaller technology firms in Britain that find it difficult to turn their innovations into commercial success. We have listened to the ideas from business groups about encouraging innovation in larger companies, and we will introduce a new &#8220;above the line&#8221; research and development tax credit in 2013 that will increase its visibility and generosity.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/48">We will give particular help to our energy-intensive industries. I have not shied away from supporting sensible steps to reduce this country&#8217;s dependency on volatile oil prices and reduce our carbon emissions. I am the Chancellor who funded the first ever Green investment bank and introduced the carbon price floor. Our green deal will help people to insulate their home and cut their heating bills. I am worried about the combined impact of the green policies adopted not just in Britain but by the European Union on some of our heavy, energy-intensive industries. We are not going to save the planet by shutting down our steel mills, aluminium smelters and paper manufacturers. All we will be doing is exporting valuable jobs from this country, so we will help them with the costs of the EU trading scheme and the carbon price floor, increase their climate change levy relief and reduce the impact of the electricity market reforms on those businesses, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/49">This amounts to a &#163;250 million package over the Parliament, and it will keep industry and jobs here in Britain. It is a reminder to us all that we should not price British businesses out of the world economy. If we burden them with endless social and environmental goals, however worthy in their own right, not only will we not achieve those goals, but the businesses will fail, jobs will be lost, and our country will be poorer.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/50">Our planning reforms strike the right balance between protecting our countryside while permitting economic development that creates jobs, but we need to go further to remove the lengthy delays and high costs of the</p>
	<p pid="a.800.3/51">current system, with new time limits on applications and new responsibilities for statutory consultees. We will make sure that the gold-plating of EU rules on things such as habitats do not place ridiculous costs on British businesses. Planning laws need reform. So too&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.808.0/1">Order. The House needs to calm down. One hon. Member has probably shouted enough for one day.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.808.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40599" speakername="George Osborne" colnum="808"  time="012:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0001.htm#11112951002196">
	<p pid="a.808.1/1">Planning laws need reform, and so too do employment rules. We know many firms are afraid to hire new staff because of their fear about the costs involved if it does not work out. We are already doubling the period before an employee can bring an unfair dismissal claim and introducing fees for tribunals. Now we will call for evidence on further reforms to make it easier to hire people, including changing the TUPE regulations; reducing delay and uncertainty in the collective redundancy process; and introducing the idea of compensated no-fault dismissal for businesses with fewer than 10 employees.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/2">We will cut the burden of health and safety rules on small firms, because we have regard for the health and safety of the British economy too. This Government have introduced flexible working practices and we are committed to fair rights for employees. But what about the right to get a job in the first place or the right to work all hours running a small business and not be sued out of existence by the costs of an employment tribunal? It is no good endlessly comparing ourselves with other European countries. The entire European continent is pricing itself out of the world economy. The same is true of taxes on business. If we tax firms out of existence, or out of the country, there will not be any tax revenues for anyone. We have set as our ambition the goal of giving this country the most competitive tax regime in the G20. Our corporate tax rate has already fallen from 28% to 26%, and I can confirm that it will fall again next April to 25%.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/3">We are undertaking major simplification of the tax code for businesses and individuals, including, this autumn, consulting on ideas to merge the administration of income tax and national insurance. We are publishing next week rules on the taxation of foreign profits, so that multinationals stop leaving Britain, and instead start coming here, and we will end low-value consignment relief for goods from the Channel Islands, which has been used by large companies to undercut shops on our high streets. We have supported enterprise by increasing the generosity of the enterprise investment scheme. Today, we are extending this scheme specifically to help new start-up businesses to get the seed investment they need. Even at the best of times they can struggle to get finance, and in the current credit conditions that struggle too often ends in failure. From April 2012, anyone investing up to &#163;100,000 in a qualifying new start-up business will be eligible for income tax relief of 50%, regardless of the rate at which they pay tax, and to get people investing in start-up Britain in 2012, for one year only, we will also waive any tax on capital gains invested through the new scheme. We can afford this with a freeze on the general capital gains tax threshold for next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/4">I also want to help existing small businesses which find the current economic conditions tough. Business rates are a disproportionately large part of their fixed</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/5">costs. In the Budget, I provided a holiday on business rates for small firms until October next year. I am today extending that rate relief holiday until April 2013. Over half a million small firms, including one third of all shops, will have reduced rate bills or no rate bills for the whole of this year and for the whole of the next financial year too. To help all businesses, including larger ones, with next year&#8217;s rise in business rates, I will allow them to defer 60% of the increase in their bills to the two following years.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/6">I also want to help any business seeking to employ a young person who is out of work. The OBR forecasts that unemployment will rise from 8.1% this year to 8.7% next year, before falling to 6.2% by the end of the forecast. Youth unemployment has been rising for seven years and is now unacceptably high. It is little comfort that this problem is affecting all western nations today. The problem is, of course, primarily a lack of jobs&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption</i> <i>.]</i> But it is made worse by a lack of skills. Too many children are leaving school after 11 years of compulsory education without the basics that they need for the world of work.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/7">Our new youth contract addresses both problems with the offer of private sector work experience for every young person unemployed for three months. After five months, there will be weekly signing on. After nine months, we will help pay for a job or an apprenticeship in a private business. Some 200,000 people will be helped in this way but, as the Deputy Prime Minister has said, this is a contract. Young people who do not engage with this offer will be considered for mandatory work activity, and those who drop out without good reason will lose their benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/8">If we are to tackle the economic performance of this country and tackle Britain&#8217;s decades-long problems with productivity, we have to transform our school system too, so that children leave school prepared for the world of work. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education is doing more to make that happen than anyone who ever had his job before him. The previous Government took six years to create 200 academies. He has created 1,200 academies in just 18 months. Supporting his education reform is a central plank of my economic policy, so today, with the savings that we have made, I am providing an extra &#163;1.2 billion&#8212;as part of the additional investment in infrastructure&#8212;to spend on our schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/9">Half of that will go to help local authorities with the greatest basic need for school places. The other &#163;600 million will go to support my right hon. Friend&#8217;s reforms and will fund 100 additional free schools. These schools will include new maths free schools for 16 to 18-year-olds. This will give our most talented young mathematicians the chance to flourish. Like the new university technical colleges, these maths free schools are exactly what Britain needs to match our competitors and produce more of the engineering and science graduates so important for our long-term economic success.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/10">To ensure that children born into the poorest families have a real chance to become one of those graduates, we will take further steps to improve early education. Last year, it was this coalition Government who not only expanded free nursery education for all three and four-year-olds, but gave children from the poorest fifth of</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/11">families a new right to 15 hours of free nursery care a week at the age of two. I can tell the House today that we can double the number of children who will receive this free nursery care: 40% of two-year-olds&#8212;260,000 children&#8212;from the most disadvantaged families will get this support in their early years.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/12">On education and early years learning, this is how we change the life chances of our least well-off and genuinely lift children out of poverty and that is how we build an economy ready to compete in the world. It will take time. The damage that we have to repair is great. People know how difficult things are and how little money there is, but where we can help with the rising cost of living, we will. I have already offered councils the resources for another year&#8217;s freeze in the council tax. That will help millions of families, but I want to do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/13">Commuters often travel long distances to go to work and bring an income home. Train fares are expensive and they are set to go up well above inflation to pay for the much needed investment in the new rail and new trains that we need, but RPI plus 3% is too much. The Government will fund a reduction in the increase to RPI plus 1%. This will apply across national rail regulated fares, across the London tube and on London buses. It will help the millions of people who use our trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/14">Millions more use their cars to go to work, and pick up the children from school. It is not a luxury for most people; it is a necessity. In the Budget I cut fuel duty by 1p. The plan was for fuel duty to be 3p higher in January and 5p higher by August next year. That would be tough for working families at a time like this, so despite all the constraints that are upon us, we are able to cancel the fuel duty increase planned for January, and fuel duty from August will be only 3p higher than it is now. Taxes on petrol will be a full 10p lower than they would have been without our action in the Budget and this autumn. Families will save &#163;144 on filling up the average family car by the end of next year. At this tough time, we are helping where we can.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/15">All that we are doing today&#8212;sticking to our deficit plan to keep interest rates as low as possible, increasing the supply of credit to pass those low rates on to families and businesses, rebalancing our economy with an active enterprise policy and new infrastructure, and providing help with the cost of living on fuel duty and rail fares&#8212;all that takes Britain in the right direction. It cannot transform our economic situation overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/16">People in this country understand the problems that Britain faces. They can watch the news any night of the week and see for themselves the crisis in the eurozone and the scale of the debt burden that we carry. People know that promises of quick fixes and more spending that this country cannot afford at times like this are like the promises of a quack doctor selling a miracle cure. We do not offer that today.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/17">What we offer is a Government who have a plan to deal with our nation&#8217;s debts to keep rates low; a Government determined to support businesses and support jobs; a Government committed to take Britain safely through the storm. Leadership for tough times&#8212;that is what we offer. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.811.1/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/2">Let me start by thanking the Chancellor of the Exchequer for advance notice of his statement, and the Office for Budget Responsibility for ensuring that the Chancellor is today setting out to the House the truth about the state of the British economy and the truly colossal failure of the Chancellor&#8217;s plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/3">Let us be clear about what the OBR has told us today, which the Chancellor could not bring himself to say: growth is flatlining and will be down this year, next year and the year after; unemployment is rising; and there will be well over &#163;100 billion more borrowing than he planned a year ago, and more than was set out in the plan he inherited at the general election. As a result, his economic and fiscal strategy is in tatters. After 18 months in office, the verdict is in: plan A has failed, and failed colossally. With prices rising and unemployment soaring, families, pensioners and businesses already know that it is hurting. With billions of pounds more in borrowing to pay for rising unemployment, today we find out the truth that it is just not working.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/4">The Prime Minister likes to say, &#8220;You can&#8217;t borrow your way out of a crisis.&#8221; Will the Chancellor confirm that that is exactly what he has been forced to do? He has been forced into higher borrowing to pay for the crisis in growth and jobs in Britain, the higher unemployment and higher benefits bill that his failing plan has delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/5">The Chancellor&#8217;s out-of-touch and complacent hubris of a year ago now seems such a distant memory. The Prime Minister boasted that Britain was out of the danger zone and the Chancellor claimed that the UK was a safe haven, but we know the truth: cutting too far and too fast has backfired and all his claims of a year ago have completely unravelled. It is not as if they were not warned, including by their coalition colleagues. Before the election, we said that, like every country after the global financial crisis, we had to get our deficit down, which meant tough decisions on tax and spending cuts. The question is not whether that should be done, but how. That is why the Opposition warned that trying to cut spending and raise taxes too far and too fast risked choking off recovery and pushing up unemployment and borrowing. We said that the Chancellor&#8217;s plan was reckless, not cautious, and that he was ripping out the foundations of the house, leaving our economy not safe, but badly and deeply exposed to the growing global storm.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/6">Let me remind the Chancellor what the managing director of the International Monetary Fund warned this summer. She said that</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/7">&#8220;slamming on the breaks too quickly will hurt the recovery and worsen job prospects.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/8">What has happened? Consumer and business confidence has slumped in the past year. Our recovery was choked off over a year ago. Since then, Britain has had slower economic growth than any G7 country other than Japan, and it had an earthquake. Unemployment is at a 17-year</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/9">high and over 1 million young people are out of work. Today we hear that growth this year will be not the 2.3% he so confidently predicted in the June Budget this year, but just 0.9%. It will be even lower next year and lower than forecast the year after. It is the fourth time the OBR has downgraded his growth forecasts in just 18 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/10">Today we learn that the Chancellor, even when judged by the one objective he set himself&#8212;getting the deficit down&#8212;is failing. With lower growth and rising unemployment pushing up the cost of failure, will he confirm that he will now have to borrow not &#163;46 billion more than set out in his autumn statement last year, as he said in March, but a staggering &#163;158 billion more? Will he also confirm that, despite the pain of the &#163;40 billion of extra spending cuts and tax rises he boasted about a year ago, because the recovery has been choked off and unemployment is higher he will be borrowing more at the end of this Parliament than he would be under the balanced plan inherited from the Labour Government at the last election? That is a fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/11">A year ago the Prime Minister told the CBI:</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/12">&#8220;In five years&#8217; time, we will have balanced the books.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/13">That was not some kind of dodgy rolling target, but a clear commitment to eliminate the deficit by 2015. Can the Chancellor tell the House whether he will meet that fiscal mandate? Is not the truth that, with unemployment and borrowing up, going further and faster has been utterly counter-productive and self-defeating and has backfired? We have had all the pain, but none of the gain.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/14">The OBR forecasts show that the Chancellor&#8217;s entire economic and fiscal strategy is now in complete disarray, yet all we get are excuses. He has blamed anyone and anything, including the Labour Government, the snow, the royal wedding, the Japanese earthquake, higher inflation, VAT, the eurozone and low-paid dinner ladies and teaching assistants&#8212;anybody but himself. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> It is he who is to blame. It is his failing plan that has pushed up unemployment and borrowing. It is his reckless gamble that has made things worse here in Britain, not better.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.1/15">If eurozone countries continue to fail to sort out their problems, of course that will have an impact here. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Ah.&#8221;] However, Britain&#8217;s economic recovery was choked off a year ago, before the euro crisis. The OBR has downgraded growth in Britain this year but upgraded growth in the euro area. Of the 27 countries in the EU, only Greece, Portugal and Cyprus have grown more slowly than Britain in the past year. Not only is it not too late for the Chancellor to change course, but the deepening euro crisis makes it even more important that he sees sense. Instead he is still clinging to the fantasy that any change of course would make things worse. He still clings to the illiterate fantasy that low long-term interest rates in Britain are a sign of enhanced credibility and not, as they were in Japan in the &#8217;90s and in America today, a sign of stagnant growth in the economy. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> This summer the head of the IMF warned the Chancellor&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.813.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" speakername="Edward Balls" colnum="813"  time="012:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0001.htm#11112951002201">
	<p pid="a.813.0/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker. They do not like it, but this is the truth. The Government set up the OBR, so maybe they should listen to its forecasts.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/2">This summer the head of the IMF warned the Chancellor that</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/3">&#8220;growth is necessary for fiscal credibility&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/4">but he said that a change in his plans would lead to a loss of credibility, even though he has been forced to confirm today that his growth and borrowing targets are wildly off track. Last month the IMF advised the Government that</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/5">&#8220;If (economic) activity were to undershoot current expectations and risk a period of stagnation or contraction, countries that face historically low yields (for example, Germany and the UK) should also consider delaying some of their planned consolidation.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/6">With the world darkening and with today&#8217;s news that here in Britain we are set to see stagnant growth not just this year, but next, is it not time the Chancellor listened to the IMF? How much worse does it have to get? How many more young people have to lose their jobs, how many more businesses have to go bankrupt, and how many more times does he have to come here to downgrade his growth forecast and upgrade his borrowing forecasts? How many more billions in borrowing do we need to pay for failure before he finally sees sense?</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/7">These would be difficult times for any Chancellor, but our fear is that once again in his statement today the Chancellor is making a catastrophic error of judgment. He is refusing to learn the lessons of history or economics; he is refusing to switch to a more balanced plan; he got it wrong 18 months ago, and he is getting wrong again today. Repeating the mistakes he made last year will only make things worse. Is it not now time to listen to the IMF, to cut taxes and to have a slower pace of spending reduction? Is it not time for him to change course before it is too late?</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/8">What do we have instead? We have a cobbled together package of growth measures, which the Chancellor must know, and the OBR forecast confirms, do not address the fundamental problem&#8212;that his rapid, reckless and deflationary plan is choking off recovery and pushing up borrowing. We have been here before. This is the third emergency growth package in a year, so the last thing our economy needs is yet another fantasy growth package.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/9">Hon. Members do not have to take my word for it. Let us look at the OBR&#8217;s own forecast. Does the OBR think that the Chancellor&#8217;s plans are going to boost growth? No, it has revised growth down next year, from 2.5% to 0.7%; and for the following year it has revised growth down from 2.9% to 2.1%. Does the OBR think that the Chancellor&#8217;s plans are going to increase employment and cut unemployment? Let me tell the House two things from the OBR forecast which the Chancellor chose not to tell the House. Unemployment is not only higher next year than this year, but higher the year after than this year; and employment is expected to fall by 100,000 next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/10">We were promised a game-changer of a statement and a growth plan that would secure recovery. Instead, we have a plan for growth which leads to lower growth and higher unemployment. It is not a game-changer; it is just more of the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/11">Let me turn to the measures that the Chancellor has announced. He has announced a new youth jobs fund, but why did he abolish the future jobs fund in the first place? The Government abolished it in their first month in office; their new plan will not be up and running until the middle of next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/12">The Chancellor claims to have increased the bank levy, so why is he cutting taxes on banks this year compared with last year&#8212;down from &#163;3.5 billion last year to &#163;2.5 billion this year? Why will he not repeat the bank bonus tax and do something proper about youth jobs?</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/13">The Chancellor has announced a sensible halt to January&#8217;s fuel duty rise, but will he confirm that, as a result of last January&#8217;s VAT rise, motorists are paying 3p a litre more on petrol? He has belatedly announced a plan on Labour&#8217;s enterprise finance guarantee, relabelled as credit easing, but why did he wait so long, and why did he put his faith in Project Merlin, which has patently failed and, as the Bank of England confirms today, seen net bank lending to small businesses fall over the past year? As for his equally belated decision to set up a new infrastructure fund, this is from the same Chancellor who abolished the Building Schools for the Future programme at a cost of tens of thousands of construction jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/14">How much of this new investment has been pre-announced? How much will happen this year and next year? How much of it is pre-announced funding from the next spending review after the next general election? Will the Chancellor confirm that the new off-budget infrastructure fund will be subject to a National Audit Office value-for-money test to ensure that projects are not more expensive to the taxpayer than direct Government borrowing?</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/15">The Chancellor has also announced a rebate for energy intensive industries to correct the chaos caused by his botched carbon floor price. He has reinstated just 10% of his planned &#163;4 billion cut in housing, but even in the past few minutes, as we have studied the small print, and despite all the bluster of the new measures, we have found that because this Chancellor is so determined not to break from his failing plan, he is once again giving with one hand and taking with the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/16">How are these new growth measures being paid for? By hitting families and savers. How much will the Chancellor&#8217;s cut in tax credits cost a working family on average incomes? With inflation so much higher, is he still meeting the Prime Minister&#8217;s pledge to deliver real-terms rises in NHS spending in this Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/17">As a result, and taking into account pre-announced measures in the Chancellor&#8217;s Budget and spending review, are the Government still hitting women harder than men? Are they still increasing child poverty and not reducing it? Given that he has already cut child care support by more than &#163;1.5 billion, is he helping women who want to go out to work, or is he making it harder?</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/18">If we are all in this together, why with this Government is it always families, women and children who pay the price? It is clear: the Chancellor&#8217;s plan is not working. The OBR knows it, the markets know it, the IMF knows it, we know it and so, increasingly, do the Chancellor&#8217;s coalition colleagues. His arch rival, the Mayor of London, certainly knows it.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/19">We all know why the Chancellor cannot change course. We know why he cannot accept the IMF&#8217;s advice. We all know why&#8212;even as the euro crisis deepens and he is borrowing &#163;158 billion more than he planned&#8212;this oh-so political Chancellor will not budge because to change course now would be to admit that he has got the key economic judgments of this Parliament absolutely, catastrophically wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/20">If, after just 18 months, the Chancellor&#8217;s plan is leading to falling growth, rising unemployment and &#163;158 billion more in borrowing, the country needs either a new Chancellor or a new plan&#8212;a balanced and credible plan on jobs, growth and the deficit. We need real tax cuts, real investment, a real plan for jobs, growth and deficit reduction: Labour&#8217;s five-point plan for jobs, growth and deficit reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.0/21">Protecting our economy, businesses, jobs and family finances is more important than trying to protect a failed economic plan. For his sake, for his party&#8217;s sake, and in the national interest, the Chancellor needs to change course, and he needs to do so now.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.815.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40599" speakername="George Osborne" colnum="815"  time="012:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0001.htm#11112951002202">
	<p pid="a.815.0/1">As far as I can tell, the shadow Chancellor complains that we are borrowing too much&#8212;and then proposes that we borrow even more. It is completely unconvincing and a reminder to Government Members why we are so pleased that he is in the job that he is doing, for he is a constant reminder of everything that went wrong with Labour&#8217;s economic policy&#8212;a permanent advertisement for why we should never trust Labour with our money again.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/2">Let me answer the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s specific questions. He welcomes the fact that we have open and honest figures from the OBR. When did we never get them when he was at the Treasury? He complains about the bank levy. He was the City Minister, so why did he not introduce a bank levy? It will raise &#163;2.5 billion a year. In the Labour policy document on the bonus tax that he proposes, his party costs its measure at &#163;2 billion a year. That is less&#8212;a tax cut for banks, if can I put it like that.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman complains about off balance-sheet borrowing. That is from Mr PFI. He says that we should have kept the future jobs fund, but 50% of all people who left that scheme were unemployed within 12 weeks, which is in part why we have an unemployment problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/4">Yes we are committed to real increases in the health budget, and yes the OBR confirms that we will meet our fiscal mandate and our debt target&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> In the terms set out by me in the emergency Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman told the House this extraordinary thing&#8212;that the OBR forecasts that growth in the UK will be less than in the euro area. That, I am afraid, is simply not true. I am not going to use unparliamentary language, but it is in the OBR document in black and white: 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015&#8212;every single year, growth unfortunately is slow in the eurozone and slower than in the UK. That is one of the problems we are facing.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/6">Let me respond to the three arguments that the right hon. Gentleman advanced in his reply. First, he said that we should try to borrow our way out of a debt crisis; he talked about extra borrowing. His plans&#8212;the plans of the previous Government&#8212;would have led to</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/7">an additional &#163;100 billion on top of borrowing over the course of the Parliament. Let us look at the facts. There is not a single credible political party in the entirety of Europe that is proposing more spending at the moment, apart from&#8212;and it is not credible&#8212;the Labour party. This is what Tony Blair said this morning on the radio&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/8" class="italic">[</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/9" class="italic">Interruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/10" class="italic">]</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/11">Go on&#8212;have a go at booing him! Tony Blair said on the radio this morning:</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/12">&#8220;frankly whatever government is in power it is going to be pursuing a pretty tough programme at the moment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/13">Blair or Balls&#8212;I think the British public made their mind up on Labour politicians long ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/14">The second astonishing argument that the right hon. Gentleman deployed was to say that low interest rates in Britain were a sign of failure. Presumably that means that he wants interest rates to be higher in Britain. Presumably the fact that Italian interest rates are over 7% is a sign of success. Presumably the fact that Greek interest rates are 30% is an economic miracle. His policy for higher interest rates would put families&#8217; mortgage bills up, increase debt interest charges for taxpayers, increase the cost of loans for small businesses, and put people out of work. Now people know&#8212;you vote Labour, you get higher interest rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/15">The third and final argument that the right hon. Gentleman advanced is that the events happening in Europe will have almost no impact on anyone in Britain or on the British economy. [Hon. Members: &#8220;That&#8217;s not what he said.&#8221;] He mentioned it once in passing. That flies in the face of what the Bank of England says and what the OECD said yesterday. He quoted the IMF. The IMF supports our deficit reduction plan. It explicitly asked itself the question, &#8220;Should Britain change course?&#8221;, and said no. He quoted the independent OBR&#8217;s numbers, but he refuses to accept its analysis. Anyone who turns on the television and listens to the news knows that his argument is completely absurd, so we have to ask ourselves why he advances it. Why does he alone advance the argument that Britain is not affected by what has been going on in the world&#8212;by the external oil shocks, by the size of the financial crisis, by the eurozone crisis? There is a very simple reason: because if he admits that we are in a debt crisis, then he has to admit that we borrowed too much when he was in office, that the crash here was deeper than anywhere else, and that the effects were longer lasting. It would be an admission of his personal failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/16">The right hon. Gentleman was the City Minister who let the City explode. He is the author of the golden rules that failed. He does not have the excuse of the Leader of the Opposition that he was only photocopying orders: he gave the orders; the orders came from him. Labour&#8217;s economic credibility will never recover while he remains the shadow Chancellor.</p>

	<p pid="a.816.0/1">The whole country, I think, will welcome the supply-side measures announced today, which are an essential counterpart to the deficit reduction plan. Britain&#8217;s recovery depends on thousands of small businesses in our constituencies that need the confidence and the cash to invest and grow. That is why the credit easing package that has been announced today is so welcome. Does my right hon. Friend agree, though, that the recovery can be secured in the long term only when we have banks that are operating normally &#8212;when we have a return to more normal lending</p>

	<p pid="a.817.0/1">I agree with the Chair of the Treasury Committee that the impact of the financial crisis and the deleveraging in the British financial system and other financial systems are having a huge impact not just on our recovery but on recoveries around the world. I completely agree that we need to try to clear the impaired balance sheets of the banking system. We need to try to get new lenders on to the high street. That is why we took the decision we took on Northern Rock&#8212;to get Virgin Money out there on the high street. I will have more to say on the banking system next month when I respond to the Vickers report and to the very good report from the Treasury Committee.</p>

	<p pid="a.817.1/1">I welcome the announcement of more investment in infrastructure, but the more I hear about the proposal, the more it sounds like PFI by any other name. Pension funds will invest in public projects only if it is a good deal for them. As with PFI, any sweetener that the Chancellor offers to the private sector will be at the expense of the taxpayer, both in the short term today and for future generations, so what precisely is he offering and proposing to attract pension fund investment, and how is he going to ensure that his scheme represents value for money for the taxpayer?</p>

	<p pid="a.817.2/1">Let me explain to the right hon. Lady that what we are seeking to do is to get the pension funds investing in British infrastructure. We are not proposing to provide, in this respect, guarantees for these projects. There are some guarantees set out for specific Government infrastructure projects such as the Thames tidal waste tunnel. What I am talking about with the pension funds is not guaranteed projects like PFI; it is simply about trying to get private sector money invested in British infrastructure. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Let me explain, briefly.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.2/2">We have Canadian and Australian pension funds investing in Britain, but not British pension funds investing on a sufficient scale. We are going to try to bring them together, through a private sector agreement, into vehicles where they can co-operate and then invest in infrastructure. This is not about the Government underwriting those investments; it is about trying to get the industry together to make private sector investments. There is a memorandum of understanding which sets out how this is done.</p>

He has rejected the argument for a job guarantee and instead embraced wage subsidies, which he says will help about 53,000 young people. For the sake of those young people, will he look at the similar scheme announced by his right hon. and learned Friend the current Secretary of State for Justice, in 1995? That scheme promised 130,000 jobs, but only 2,300 applications came forward.

This is a problem that all western countries are facing at the moment. Frankly, in Britain youth unemployment has been going up for the past seven years. A subsidised job in the private sector is part of the answer. The work experience places are already working well, and we are adding to those. Of course, there is some conditionality in all this, so we are introducing, for example, weekly signing on after five months.</p>

Is not his core &#163;5 billion infrastructure package&#8212;just 0.7% of current expenditure&#8212;merely tinkering at the edges and completely incapable of pulling Britain out of its deepening slump?</p>

	<p pid="a.819.0/1">As I said in my statement, I believe, particularly in a debt crisis, that monetary policy is the most powerful tool for supporting demand. The Bank of England has undertaken the quantitative easing programme, which the previous Government thought was the right policy as they authorised the Monetary Policy Committee&#8217;s request. We can also do a lot to try to improve the credit conditions for small businesses, which do a huge amount to employ people in our country. That is why we have taken action on credit easing. The right hon. Gentleman has to balance the cost that a 1% rise in interest rates would have for mortgage bills, debt interest bills, family business loans and the like, which I set out, with the need for the additional billions of pounds of borrowing that he is proposing on top of the borrowing that we are already doing and what that might do to the credibility of this country in international markets.</p>

I am very happy to sit down with her, and indeed other Members from Staffordshire, to work with them on what we can do to make the proposal a success.

	<p pid="a.824.6/1">The Treasury is very clear that in the precise way in which child poverty is measured against the baseline, it has gone up. We have been honest about that in the document. However, there is also an inflationary increase in the child tax credit and other benefits, so the picture is more mixed and better for tackling child poverty. I would also make the broader argument that investing in early years education and schools, and so transforming people&#8217;s life chances, will do more to lift people out of poverty.

Does he accept responsibility for the catastrophic 99% collapse in affordable house building in the past six months, which is 187% in the west midlands? Does he agree that today he is restoring but 10% of what he cut, when the need for building homes and jobs has never been greater?</p>

Later today, I will be going to another meeting of European Finance Ministers in Brussels to try to get a better resolution of the problems.</p>

There is also the expansion of the north-eastern one to the Port of Blyth, which is warmly welcomed on the Opposition Benches. I am happy to meet the hon. Gentleman to discuss the problem. On the national loan guarantee scheme, he is right to say that we have to get the audit trail right. We are looking very closely and seeking to model a lot of what we are doing on the European Investment Bank&#8217;s scheme, which already delivers lower rates to small businesses in Britain. It is a small scheme but the procedures are already in place. I can confirm that the credit risk of the small business loan sits with the banks.</p>

It has to be tolled to be paid for, however, as I am sure people understand, but I would draw a distinction with the Humber bridge: the debt on the Humber bridge was paid for many years ago and so the tolls were unreasonable. However, when providing new infrastructure, we have to find a way of funding it. It has to come either from general taxation&#8212;we are providing tax support&#8212;or out of the tolls.

	<p pid="a.840.4/1">The seed enterprise investment scheme will provide 50% tax relief for all who invest in a qualifying start-up, even if they do not pay the 50% rate of income tax. The investment can be up to &#163;100,000, although of course it can be much less. The companies involved can receive a maximum of &#163;150,000. Those who have a capital gain can invest up to &#163;100,000 of it in the scheme, and the amount will be tax-free for the next financial year. The scheme is aimed at small as well as slightly larger investors, and is designed to help start-up companies to obtain the finance they need.</p>

It is important that we do not price our industry out of the world market. That would do nothing to reduce our carbon emissions, but it would damage our economy. We have worked with the energy-intensive industries and the business organisations to develop our package, and I think that it achieves the right balance between ensuring that those industries remain competitive and meeting our international environmental obligations.</p>

It will provide work experience after three months for the unemployed, it will require weekly signing on after five months, and it will provide subsidised jobs in the private sector, encouraging businesses to get people into work and offer apprenticeships. In return, it will ask those young people actively to look for work, and there are sanctions if they do not do so. That is what we are offering the young people of Lewisham, who were so badly betrayed by a Labour Government.</p>

Will he confirm how many people nationally he expects the mortgage indemnity scheme to help, when it might start and how many jobs it is likely to create?</p>

	<p pid="a.845.1/1">From memory, I think it is going to help 100,000 people, and that is a real boost. With the other housing measures we are taking, including the support for stalled sites&#8212;the &#163;400 million package we are providing&#8212;we hope that that is going to create several hundred thousand jobs in the construction industry over the period going forward. The 50% right-to-buy discount we are introducing revives one of the most effective social policies of the past few decades&#8212;one that the Labour leader recently had to admit had worked and that the Labour party was wrong to oppose. A crucial additional element is that we are going to use the money to build social housing, which is why I think it is a policy appropriate to the modern age.</p>

	<p pid="a.845.3/1">I can absolutely assure my hon. Friend that we are going ahead with the cap on housing benefit, which is an important part of controlling costs. It is not</p>
	<p pid="a.845.3/2">fair that working people pay taxes to fund the rent for people who live in houses that those working people could never afford out of their salaries. It is quite right to introduce a cap to try to control those costs. Of all the benefits provided under the previous Government, this was one that really went through the roof, so to speak. Dealing with it and controlling it is a very important policy and it is a tragedy that the Labour party opposes the measure and no doubt wants to get rid of it at the next election.</p>

	<p pid="a.847.1/3">Mr Speaker, have you received any indication from the Secretary of State or the Minister as to why they did not seek the opportunity to make that statement at yesterday&#8217;s DWP questions, during Report of the Welfare Reform Bill in the House of Lords, or at any point during the progress of that Bill through the House of Commons, but instead waited to give a statement to <i>The Times</i>?</p>

	<p pid="a.847.3/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for her point of order. The short answer to her inquiry is no, I was not given any indication by any Minister on that matter. Naturally, the timing of Government statements is a matter for Ministers, as is whether a Minister chooses to make an announcement via oral questions or during a debate in the House. However, the basic point stands that policy announcements should first be made in the House and not through the newspapers. I understand the very real concern that exists on this matter because it is shared by me, and I have discussed it with the Leader of the House.</p>

I know that the Chancellor would accept that as being entirely right and proper. The issues have been explored very fully. That, at least, is a satisfactory state of affairs.</p>

	<p pid="a.849.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to introduce a requirement that electoral registration be a condition of access to public services; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/3">I am introducing this Bill because I believe in the power of democracy. Earlier this summer, we saw the consequences of alienation. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions described</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/4">&#8220;a divided society, with a destructive minority apparently detached from notions of right and wrong&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/5">Of course, the riots were individual acts of criminality, but I agree with him that a large number of people feel so detached from society that they have nothing to lose. There is a democratic deficit. I therefore believe that we should actively include our whole community in our democracy, to combat such alienation.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/6">At present, registering to vote is just about the nearest thing that we have to a social contract. It is an acknowledgement that we live in a democracy and that we abide by the outcome of that democracy, yet around 3.5 million people are not registered to vote. According to the Electoral Commission that minority, who are not engaged, are likely to be made up of the disadvantaged: young people, people on low incomes, private sector tenants, some but not all ethnic minorities, and people with disabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/7">My Bill aims to bridge the gap between that excluded group and the rest of our community because social breakdown takes place in that gap. If someone wants to access housing benefits, a state pension, a national insurance number or even a driving licence, they will need to be on the electoral register if the Bill is passed. I do not think that that is a great imposition. After all, if someone needs to be on the electoral register to get a credit card, why is it a problem to be on it to get a driving licence?</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/8">Linking access to public services with the electoral register will increase participation and provide an explicit link between the democratic process and the benefits that we enjoy because we live in a democracy, and, yes, it is tough love. It will mean that if people want the benefits of living in a democracy, they need to sign up to democracy. If they do not like living in a democracy, fine, they need not sign, but they should not expect all the good things in return.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/9">Already, the electoral register has many useful purposes &#8212;for instance, it is the source of deciding who does jury service&#8212;and it is already possibly the country&#8217;s most cost-effective anti-crime database. The police use it if they want to catch up with someone or need to find out who a suspect might live with or know. Banks and credit companies use it to prevent fraud. Many councils already use it to check that people are paying their council tax or are on the right benefits. Charities and direct marketing companies use it to help their businesses and to raise funds for countless good causes. Finally, of course, its most important role is to give people a chance to vote. It is therefore in everyone&#8217;s interests for the electoral register to be as comprehensive as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/10">My Bill will target precisely the people who are unlikely to register, to bridge the 3.5 million gap. Sadly, we also need the Bill now to remedy a number of other measures being introduced by the Government that every commentator expects will widen that gap. First, they plan to make registering to vote optional. That is a dangerous step. It will legitimise disengagement and institutionalise an underclass. In countries where registration is optional, the already disadvantaged are those most likely to lose out. In the US, only six in 10 people on incomes below $20,000 register, and registration rates are just as low among under-25s and people who rent their homes&#8212;precisely the demographic of those who were involved in our riots.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/11">The Government have suggested that councils might not need to chase up electoral registration forms with an annual canvass of every property. Again, I think that that is a retrograde step. My council, Merton, has told me that its canvass is effective. Before it took place, only 65% of homes returned their forms; afterwards, 97% did so. Finally, the Government have said that they would stop mums and dads registering their children to vote. When individual registration was introduced in Northern Ireland, the register collapsed by 11%, and the Electoral Commission said that that adversely affected disadvantaged groups&#8212;just the sort of people with whom we most need to engage to prevent exclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/12">Combined, the Government&#8217;s measures are likely to take about a third of voters off the register&#8212;more in areas of deprivation. People on the edge of society will further disengage, and we will institutionalise the underclass. What is worse, because the register will be less accurate and comprehensive, far from preventing fraud the proposals will increase it. The Government&#8217;s own papers admit that fraudulent electoral registration is &#8220;rare&#8221;, and that 20 times more people are satisfied with how they register to vote than dissatisfied. Only 2% of us think that registering to vote is &#8220;very unsafe&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/13">There is little incentive to register fraudulently, because councils such as mine already use the electoral register to ensure that everyone pays council tax. In fact, the electoral register is widely seen as more accurate and less prone to fraud than virtually any other data set. A number of councils have looked at using other databases to improve the electoral register, but the consensus seems to be that the electoral register is already the best. They have told the Select Committee on Political and Constitutional Reform that other databases</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/14">&#8220;tell us what we do know, rather than what we don&#8217;t&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/15">Many other databases are terrible by comparison. The Department for Work and Pensions database, for instance, includes people who are dead or who have left the country, and it does not include any information about nationality. As the information industry and crime fighters have known for years, the electoral register is the most accurate, because it is based on better intelligence from the people who actually live at each address and know who else does. Instead of undermining the electoral register in the mistaken belief that fraudulent voting is widespread, we should place greater emphasis on it in order to tackle other fraud.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/16">The problem with our electoral register is not that there are too many people on it; it is that there are still 3.5 million who are not. My Bill is therefore a remedy for the Government&#8217;s proposals. It will reinstate those missing millions, the majority of whom may be eligible</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/17">for benefits, tax credits, a state pension, a driving licence and so on. It will make the register even more accurate, and it will ensure that even more disadvantaged people engage in the democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/18">In the past few months, I have heard many speeches about social breakdown and an excluded underclass without a stake in their community. I have not heard anyone calling for a &#8220;something for nothing&#8221; society. What this Bill says is that we should live in a &#8220;something for something&#8221; society: public services in return for a civic duty. Registering to vote might seem like a small thing, but if we send the message that people have to sign up to democracy if they want the rewards of living in a democracy, who knows, we might even strengthen it.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.2/19">Registering to vote is a symbol of engagement, and recognition that people are not on the margins but a full part of our society. We do not need to take millions of people without a stake in their community off the electoral register&#8212;that will only institutionalise the underclass. We need an explicit social contract, and the Bill will achieve that. It will tackle fraud and reduce social exclusion, but more than that, it will ensure that more people have a chance to vote. If they do not like what is going on in their community, they will not have to destroy local shops&#8212;they can get rid of us. On that positive note, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.852.4/1">The amendments address a technical concern raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.4/2">Hon. Members will recall that the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006 provides for the making of advertising and trading regulations. Under the Act, all such regulations, including amending regulations, are subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. The Bill, when we debated it earlier this year, would have amended the 2006 Act to provide that advertising and trading regulations, apart from the first set, could be made via the negative resolution procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.4/3">The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, in its report of <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-14">14 October</phrase>, accepted the need to amend the 2006 Act to facilitate the amendment of the regulations via the quicker negative resolution procedure.</p>

	<p pid="a.852.5/1">I wonder whether the Minister has heard of the controversy surrounding the sponsorship of the Olympics by the Dow Chemical Company. As we approach this Friday, the 27th anniversary of Bhopal, there is concern among Indian athletes and Indian parliamentarians about the issue. Will it affect the regulations? If, for example, Dow withdraws its sponsorship or is asked to withdraw its sponsorship, will these regulations affect that in any way?</p>

	<p pid="a.852.6/1">The short answer is no. I am entirely aware of the controversy that the right hon. Gentleman mentions. I believe the Indian Olympic committee is meeting this week and plans to make a decision. I am told that it is not planning a boycott or anything like it, but clearly that is a matter for the Indian Government and their Olympic committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.6/2">It is recommended that the Bill be amended to provide that the affirmative resolution procedure must be used unless the Minister considers it necessary, by reason of urgency, to use the negative procedure. As I made clear when clause 2 was debated in this House, it was always my intention that the negative resolution procedure would be used only when there was an urgent need to do so. As such, the Government were happy to accept the Committee&#8217;s recommendation and to provide the additional clarification, and tabled amendments in Committee in the other place accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.6/3">The effect of these amendments is that advertising and trading regulations will be made via the negative procedure only if the Minister considers that that is necessary by reason of urgency. In such a case, the regulations will confirm, on their face, that this is the</p>
	<p pid="a.852.6/4">Minister&#8217;s view. They also provide for the corresponding procedure in the Scottish Parliament, for advertising and trading regulations made by Scottish Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.6/5">What we mean by &#8220;urgency&#8221; is that, for reasons of time, it would be impractical to use the affirmative procedure and necessary instead to use the negative procedure. This is likely to be because the amending regulations have to take effect quickly, before the earliest date that affirmative regulations could practicably be made. In essence, then, the amendments simply provide further assurance that the negative procedure would be used only when there is an urgent need to do so, and as a result provides extra assurance to Parliament. That was always the intention.</p>

	<p pid="a.853.0/1">I am pleased to support the Government&#8217;s technical amendments, which I think strike the right balance between parliamentary accountability and the need to be able to respond flexibly to urgent changes in situations. As we draw this process to a close, I will take the opportunity to commend all the officials who worked on the earlier legislation with me when I was Secretary of State and now support the Minister in taking it forward. This legislation is important for protecting the essential vision and ambition shared by Members on both sides of the House for our Olympic games. It relates to protection against ticket touting and the need to ensure the smooth operational running of the servicing for Olympic and Paralympic venues.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.0/2">There are just eight months until the start of the Olympics. They are under budget, the venues and the Olympic village have been built on time and the torch relay has been announced. There is a real sense of excitement across the country. There may not be many other opportunities allowed by the long title or any other event to debate the Olympics, but I know that the Minister is always available to discuss matters of outstanding concern, such as that raised by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> and the legacy. I can assure the Minister that all those discussions will be in the spirit of the cross-party support that has been such an important feature of the preparation for the games.</p>

	<p pid="a.853.3/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">The right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> rightly praises the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Tessa</p>
	<p pid="a.853.3/2">Jowell), who praised the Minister, and I would like to praise them both for the excellent work they are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.3/3">It is interesting that we are debating two minor technical amendments to a Bill we debated not long ago. On Second Reading I pointed out that the explanatory notes stated that the Bill</p>
	<p pid="a.853.3/4">&#8220;makes a small number of technical amendments to the advertising and trading, ticket touting, and traffic management provisions of the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.853.3/5">We are now debating minor amendments to a Bill that itself made minor amendments to another Bill, but they are none the less important, because they reflect the spirit of what the Minister said when we debated the Bill. In relation to the advertising regulations contained therein, I think that we were all encouraged to hear that he is keen to introduce those as sensibly as possible. Indeed, on Second Reading he said that the advertising regulations would be treated with a &#8220;light-touch approach&#8221;. He later said that they would be handled &#8220;sensitively&#8221;, and on another occasion he said that they would be dealt with &#8220;proportionately&#8221;. We are grateful for all three assurances.</p>
	<p pid="a.853.3/6">We are also grateful for the assurance that if, for example, the venue or timing of an event need to be altered, we have the ability to debate the matter in Parliament if those necessary changes relate to advertising. We all recognise that if, for example, a major burst water main causes a change in venue or timing at short notice, it is important, as others have suggested, that we have the power to ensure that we can continue to do what the Act is for: protecting the main sponsors of the event so that people do not leap on to a sudden change in order to introduce ambush marketing, for example. They are small amendments, but they are sensible and important and we certainly support them.</p>

	<p pid="a.855.5/1">The Bill returns to the House after its consideration in the other place. It was subject to lengthy and detailed scrutiny here in the summer, with 10 sittings in Committee, a Report and a Third Reading, all of which were characterised by a high standard of debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/2">Their lordships have now given the Bill the full benefit of their expertise, and I am pleased to say that its main provisions are largely as they left this House, reflecting an acceptance that, however unfortunate this might be, there are a small number of individuals involved in terrorism whom we cannot successfully prosecute or deport, and the measures in the Bill are needed to deal with such individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/3">The Bill returns from the other place subject to 11 Government amendments, which are largely minor and technical changes to clarify drafting and better to reflect the policy intention. I will briefly explain why we have made those amendments, dealing first with Lords amendments 1 to 10 before moving on to Lords amendment 11 and Opposition amendment (a).</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/4">Lords amendments 1 and 2 make a small but necessary change to clause 8. The clause provides that the court must, when granting permission to impose a terrorism prevention and investigation measure notice&#8212;a TPIM notice&#8212;at the outset of the process give directions for a directions hearing in relation to the automatic full review of the case. As the Bill was originally drafted, that directions hearing would have had to have taken place within seven days of the TPIM notice being served, unless the individual agreed to postpone it.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/5">The programming of such hearings is, of course, a matter for the courts. It became clear that the original provision had unintentionally introduced a restriction on the discretion available to the courts to manage similar directions hearings in the control order context. We were therefore asked by Her Majesty&#8217;s Courts and Tribunal Service to make a change to the Bill in order to provide the courts with a degree of flexibility in that respect and to facilitate effective management of court time.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/6">We have therefore amended clause 8 so that the court may programme the directions hearing later than seven days after service of the TPIM notice, if it so directs. Of course, the intention is that directions hearings will be listed within those seven days where possible, but when the court is unable to do so, for example over a holiday period, the amendment will give the court the discretion to list the hearing slightly later.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.5/7">Clause 8 still ensures, at subsection (5), that directions given at the hearing must provide for the substantive review hearing to be held as soon as reasonably practicable.</p>

	<p pid="a.856.0/1">How much later might it be possible to review the decision? The period is one week to start off with, but could it amount to 28 days, three months, or will it be flexible, with the court having the jurisdiction to decide that issue as well?</p>

	<p pid="a.856.1/1">It is the purpose of the amendment to give the court discretion, although a practice has been established through the jurisprudence on control orders which informs that process.

	<p pid="a.856.2/1">May I probe and press my hon. Friend a little further on this point?

Does he accept that the amendments to clause 8 will increase that level of uncertainty for people who are put under TPIMs? Does he agree that there is scope for providing, if not a seven-day limit, at least a definitive statement about for how long, at each stage of the process, such individuals will be detained?</p>

	<p pid="a.856.4/1">I greatly appreciate the Minister&#8217;s clarification. I fully accept that this is not a request by the Government. I am saying, from a political perspective on that role of the courts, that we are talking about the start of a process that imposes penalties on people and that, at almost every stage, has a level of indeterminacy about what is being put in place for them and how long it will last. Will my hon. Friend give some perspective on the suggestion that this change, even though it has been requested by the courts, further exacerbates the uncertainty in the imposition of such controls?</p>

	<p pid="a.856.5/1">I do not accept that it provides uncertainty. It provides the courts with the ability to operate the regime effectively. As this matter was raised in the Lords, we are seeking this House&#8217;s consideration to ensure that the measure is properly applied. That is the basis on which we have introduced the amendment. I think it is appropriate to provide flexibility in the way that has been proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/2">Amendment 10 relates to the police reporting measure. It makes it clear that in addition to requiring the individual to report to a police station at specified times and in a specified manner, the Secretary of State may require the individual to comply with directions given by the police in relation to such reporting. That is necessary to ensure that the individual can be required to co-operate with the practicalities of reporting&#8212;for example, requiring</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/3">him to report to the front desk of the police station, to speak to the officer there, and to sign to confirm his attendance. That has always been the intention behind the measure, and it is the current practice for control orders. It is necessary to ensure that the provision reflects the reality of how the measure is intended to operate. It is also in line with the general procedures for individuals required to report to a police station for any other reason&#8212;for example, individuals on police or court bail. Lords amendment 3 is necessary in consequence. It specifies that the definition of &#8220;TPIM decision&#8221; at clause 17(3) includes such a direction given by a constable in relation to the reporting measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/4">Lords amendments 4 and 5 are essentially technical amendments which are necessary in consequence of changes to other legislation currently before Parliament. Section 154(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, which has not been commenced, increases the maximum sentence on summary conviction in England and Wales from six months to 12 months. When the Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill was drafted, the intention was that that provision would be repealed by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill. Because of this, clause 23 provides that the maximum sentence on summary conviction for contravening a measure specified in a TPIM notice is six months. However, section 154(1) of the 2003 Act will not now be repealed. On that basis, these amendments are needed to revert to the previous practice when legislating for offences that are tried summarily. They provide for a maximum 12-month term in England and Wales, but include a transitional provision limiting the sentencing power to six months pending commencement of section 154(1) of the 2003 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/5">Lords Amendments 6 and 9 relate to the overnight residence measure. That is intended to ensure that the individual can be required to reside at a specified address and to remain there for specified periods overnight. The clear purpose of that is to manage risk. As part of that measure, it may be necessary to require the individual to remain within the residence and to prohibit them from entering any garden or outside area that forms part of the property or any communal area in a shared property during the specified hours overnight.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/6">As it was drafted, the provision did not necessarily make it clear that the measure could be applied in that way. These are essential drafting amendments to remove that uncertainty and to make clear the policy intention. They put it beyond doubt that the individual may be required to remain within their residence&#8212;that is, essentially, behind their front door&#8212;during the specified overnight period. I should make it clear that, where individuals are required to remain at their residence or are electronically monitored in other contexts, they will usually be required to remain in their house or flat and will not be allowed out into their garden. The particular requirements imposed by the Secretary of State in each case must, of course, always be necessary and proportionate. The court will subsequently consider the proportionality of each measure as part of its review of the notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/7">On the point about directions hearings that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> made, I should add that clause 8(5) still provides that the substantive hearing is to take place as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/8">I just wanted to reassure him in case he thought that the proposal was open-ended. That is certainly not the intention. I hope that the need to act expeditiously in this regard is clear to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/9">Lords Amendment 7 deletes subsection (11)(a) of clause 26, which allowed a temporary enhanced TPIM order to amend any enactment. That subsection was drafted on the basis that the temporary enhanced TPIM order would need to amend other legislation to ensure that the enhanced TPIM system would function correctly. The Government considered it further following an amendment helpfully tabled in Committee in the other place by Baroness Hamwee. We concluded that the subsection was not necessary for this purpose and therefore amended the Bill on Report to remove it.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/10">Lords Amendment 8 is necessary to ensure that the power to make a temporary enhanced TPIM order does not impinge inappropriately on devolved matters in Scotland. Clause 26, as amended, provides that a temporary enhanced TPIM order may not make any provision relating to devolved matters in Scotland, other than those already contained in the Bill, without the consent of the Scottish Government. In relation to those provisions touching on devolved matters that are already contained in the Bill, I can confirm that the Scottish Parliament passed a legislative consent motion on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-17">17 November</phrase>. I am grateful to Scottish Ministers and officials for their help in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.856.5/11">Finally, Lords Amendment 11 relates to the transitional period provided by schedule 8. In the period following the coming into force of the Bill, the control orders in force immediately before the commencement of the Bill will remain in force, unless revoked or quashed before the end of that period. Such a period is needed to ensure that there can be a safe, orderly and managed transition of individuals from the old system to the new system. As the Government have consistently made clear, the police have confirmed that extensive preparations are being made and that arrangements will be in place to manage the move from the control order system to the TPIMs system.</p>

	<p pid="a.858.2/1">I am delighted that the Minister did not give way when I sought to intervene, because he has been able to enlighten the House and demonstrate that Opposition Members who have been pressing him for months on whether the police and Security Service would be ready have partly been proved correct. Let us look at the bigger picture, however. With the Olympic</p>

	<p pid="a.859.0/1">I certainly do not accept that characterisation, and I am very happy to come on to amendment (a). We regard national security as a top priority. The right hon. Gentleman has heard me say that, and I stand by those words. He will know the responsibilities that Ministers hold in dealing with such matters, and the very careful consideration that we apply when considering changes to legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.859.0/2">Amendment (a) to Lords amendment 11, which stands in the names of the right hon. Gentleman and other Opposition Members, would replace the 42-day transitional period with one of 365 days. It brings us back to an issue that was debated at length during the Bill&#8217;s passage through this House and the other place. To that extent, it takes us back over a number of points that have been debated and discussed in great detail, and my response is unchanged: I believe that the amendment is simply not necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.859.0/3">As I have repeatedly made clear, the Metropolitan police and the Security Service have confirmed to the Home Secretary and myself that extensive preparations are being made and that arrangements will be in place to manage the move from the control orders system to the TPIMs system effectively. Indeed, the Home Secretary received a detailed briefing from the Metropolitan police only last week on the transitional plans that it has drawn up. However, the police recently advised us that a slightly longer transitional period was needed, as it will fall over the Christmas and new year period. We have consequently increased the transitional period to 42 days, which will assist in the effective management of the process of transition in individual cases. It was for that reason that the Lords amendment was introduced.</p>

	<p pid="a.859.1/1">I would not in any way wish to accuse the Minister of being soft on terrorism, but equally, given the relatively small number of people who are currently subject to control orders&#8212;about nine&#8212;does he not see that it might be more sensible to have an overlapping system of control orders and TPIMs for the difficult period of unknown threat around the Olympic games? There is some sense in that, given that at most nine people would be affected.</p>

	<p pid="a.859.2/1">We have considered the issue very carefully, and as I said on Report, we have received assurances from the police and Security Service that effective arrangements will be in place to manage the transfer to TPIMs when the new regime comes into effect. What I said on Report remains the case: the police and Security Service have been developing the additional capacity and capability needed to prepare for the transition to the new TPIMs regime. That preparation has been ongoing for a considerable time.</p>
	<p pid="a.859.2/2">I should be absolutely clear that the additional resources are not simply about providing additional human surveillance capacity. The police and the Security Service are using the additional money to enhance their use of a range of covert investigative techniques, including human and technical surveillance. Inevitably, some of the benefits</p>
	<p pid="a.859.2/3">from the additional resources will take time to be fully realised, as it will be necessary to take the time to train and deploy additional staff in order to derive full benefit from technical investment. However, the key point is that at the point of the transition to the new TPIMs arrangement, effective arrangements will be in place in both the police and the Security Service.</p>

	<p pid="a.860.0/1">Can the Minister explain the exact thinking behind that relatively modest extension of the transitional period to 42 days? I do not quite understand why its coinciding with the Christmas and new year period makes it difficult to introduce what will presumably be a simpler system than the one that we currently have.</p>

	<p pid="a.860.1/1">Christmas and the holiday season obviously have operational impacts, and we are therefore simply adding those 14 days to the 28 days for which the Bill originally provided to assist in the effective transition and management at that time. It is not about readiness; it is simply to aid the transition process for those people who are already on control orders and who may subsequently move on to terrorism prevention and investigation measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.860.1/2">On Report and Third Reading, I was told, &#8220;Well, you say that the police are prepared and that appropriate arrangements are in place to manage the transfer effectively from control orders to TPIMs&#8221;, and I heard clearly the comments that were made then. I will put in the Library a letter from Assistant-Commissioner Cressida Dick, which sets out the preparedness of the Metropolitan police and underlines that arrangements will be in place to manage the transfer effectively. I note that the Opposition have consistently made several points about that. Again, I underline that effective arrangements will be in place to manage the transition. In the light of my continued assurances on the matter, I hope that Opposition Members will be willing to withdraw amendment (a).</p>

	<p pid="a.860.2/1">I thank the Minister for clearly setting out the bulk of the amendments. Having read the transcripts of the evidence sessions in Committee, it is clear that the Government were pushed and pressed, as is right, through effective scrutiny from all members of the Committee and Members in the other place, to table amendments to clarify the Bill&#8217;s intention. On that basis, the Opposition are satisfied with Lords amendments 1 to 10.</p>
	<p pid="a.860.2/2">However, I want to comment on Lords amendment 11 and amendment (a) to it. As the Minister said, the Lords amendment increases the transitional period for which schedule 8 provides, during which a control order that is enforced immediately before the commencement of the Bill will remain in force, unless revoked or quashed before the end of that period, from 28 days to 42 days. The Opposition Front Benchers&#8217; amendment would increase that transitional period to 365 days. It is worth pointing out that those who have put their names to the amendment include two former police and terrorism Ministers and a former Minister who dealt with terrorism in Northern Ireland in the previous Government. Those Members clearly have a lot of detailed information and experience in dealing with such matters, and they thought it appropriate to put their names to the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.860.2/3">Why have we tabled amendment (a)? It is because we want to support the Government in keeping the country as safe as possible as they move to the new regime of TPIMs. I heard clearly the Minister&#8217;s comments about his commitment to national security being a top priority. Of course, the Opposition support that priority. However, we believe that a more flexible approach would be a better way forward on the transitional period that is in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.860.2/4">I certainly do not wish to reopen the debate on control orders, but we know that nine people are currently subject to them&#8212;a small number of people who are intent on doing grave harm to this country. It is not possible to prosecute them, but to keep the country safe, we need to impose intrusive restrictions on them. I think that there are 11 control orders in total, but nine have the power to relocate as one of the conditions. We know that the Home Secretary has used control orders with relocation provisions in cases CD and BM. In the case of CD, a challenge to the decision to relocate went to the High Court. It was dismissed and the relocation was upheld.</p>
	<p pid="a.860.2/5">It is important to quote the Mayor of London, who obviously has a keen interest in those matters. He said on the case of CD:</p>
	<p pid="a.860.2/6">&#8220;It&#8217;s clear from the court papers that he rejects and would like to destroy everything that makes this a great city. We don&#8217;t want this man in London.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.860.2/7">In moving to the new TPIMs regime, the relocation provisions will not be available to the Home Secretary in future. We want to ensure that no unnecessary risks are taken over the next 12 months. As hon. Members have already said, we will have major events in our city, including not only the Olympics and the Paralympics, but the diamond jubilee. So we need to ensure that London is kept as safe as possible in 2012.</p>

	<p pid="a.862.2/1">It is important that the evidence is not taken out of context. My hon. Friend the Minister subsequently received assurances&#8212;as he will no doubt be able to confirm&#8212;from the security services and the Metropolitan police that there would be no problem with the Government&#8217;s proposed timetable for the introduction, and I am therefore surprised that the hon.

	<p pid="a.862.3/1">It is important that evidence given to the Committee, which I read out verbatim from the transcript, is put before the House when we are debating the amendment on 365 days. The hon. and learned Gentleman has clearly put his point on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.862.3/2">Evidence was also given by Lord Carlile, and he talked about the cost of the new surveillance techniques that would have to be employed. He said that the costs would be between &#163;11 million and &#163;18 million per person per year, and he also mentioned that as far as he was aware the cost of a control order was &#163;1.8 million per person. So a huge amount of money will need to be invested in ensuring that these new surveillance techniques are properly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.862.3/3">Given the evidence put before the Committee and in the other place, we know that some senior police officers still have concerns about the readiness&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Well, in recent weeks there have been reports that senior police officers are not satisfied. I understand what the Minister said, and I shall ask him to address the point in a moment, but while we welcome the Government&#8217;s move from 28 days to 42 days&#8212;and I understand what the Minister says about that being appropriate during the holiday period&#8212;it is sensible to reconsider where we are at this stage. Given that some senior police officers feel that we are not prepared enough, that the Mayor of London has made his views clear and asked the Government to think again on this issue and that the Olympics, Paralympics and diamond jubilee celebrations are ahead of us, it is appropriate for the Minister to reflect on what the provision will mean. We have a two-week extension. Would it not be sensible to give the police and the security services more time and some flexibility to ensure that we have the resources, the people and the training in place? Is it not better to legislate now to keep control orders for that flexible period until we are absolutely certain and confident that surveillance is fully in place and all systems are operational?</p>
	<p pid="a.862.3/4">I acknowledge the difficulty that the Minister is in in dealing with these matters, which are very sensitive, and information has to be kept confidential, so I ask him, first, to make available to the independent reviewer all details about what resources have been allocated to the new TPIMs regime, the budget allocation, the personnel recruitment figures and the training that has been provided. Secondly, can the independent reviewer have all progress reports on the preparation that has been undertaken to date? Thirdly, will the independent reviewer have the opportunity to look at all the cases, decisions and information that is made available about what to do with the current controlees? Fourthly, will the Minister seek from the police and security services their views about the readiness to deal with the changes that the new regime brings in? Fifthly, will he consider the costings for the new measures and whether sufficient resources have been set aside?</p>
	<p pid="a.862.3/5">Given that the coming year is so important, that getting the transitional proposals correct is vital and that we all have a commitment to national security, I would like to press our amendment (a) to Lords amendment 11 to a Division to test the opinion of the House. I know other Members wish to speak so I will conclude my remarks.</p>

	<p pid="a.863.0/1">Let me make a few brief comments in relation to a couple of amendments. On amendment 10, subject to any security requirements, will the Minister confirm whether the requirement to report to a police station will not be so onerous in terms of the timing that it actually precludes someone subject to TPIMs being able to undertake employment or coursework? If we want them to integrate, we must allow that to happen, subject to the appropriate security requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.863.0/2">My other point is in relation to amendment 11. When I saw a reference to 28 days being changed to 42, I had concerns that we were re-running a completely different debate. I welcome the fact that the Minister and the Government have responded positively to the Metropolitan police&#8217;s request that for operational reasons a longer period is needed to enable the transition from control orders to TPIMs to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.863.0/3">I congratulate the Minister on not listening to the siren voices on the Opposition Benches who are tempting him to abandon TPIMs all together and to stick with control orders.</p>

	<p pid="a.863.2/1">In one minute. It is regrettable that the paperwork that has been produced to support the contention that control orders should remain in place, or that the implementation of TPIMs should be delayed, relies on evidence from Mr Osborne. I am sure that the evidence was appropriate at the time but things have moved on. I do not know whether Mr Osborne is now actively engaged in the process of ensuring that the appropriate measures are in place. If he is, it might be worth asking him whether he feels that suitable preparations have been made. If he is not actively engaged, it might be that he is now somewhat removed from what is happening in practice.</p>

Does he not accept that people who are on control orders, and people in future who will be on TPIMs, are some of the most dangerous people in our country and they would not be on those orders if they did not pose a significant and substantial threat to the life, health and safety of our citizens?</p>

She is right that some&#8212;potentially all&#8212;of them will undoubtedly present a serious threat, but in practice some of them might not be quite as guilty as she believes.</p>

	<p pid="a.864.4/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that control orders are a very serious and very great power used against people who have not been convicted? This is state power against an individual on the basis of suspicion, not evidence or conviction, so it is a serious matter. Does he also agree that TPIMs&#8212;despite my reservations about them&#8212;are an improvement on control orders and ought to be introduced as soon as practicably reasonable? I do not understand why they should be delayed for a year on the basis of the Olympic games. Presumably other events are approaching in 2013, 2014 and so on that would provide the same opportunity.</p>

	<p pid="a.864.5/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention. One wonders why, having suggested that 365 days might be appropriate, the Labour party, excluding <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>, has not considered other significant events coming down the line for which it might feel that control orders should also be available.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.5/2">I want to rephrase what I said about the Labour party playing for headlines in the <i>Daily Mail</i> and the <i>Daily Express</i>. It might be more appropriate to deploy that argument in relation to the populist policing agenda rather than this serious issue of security.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.5/3">In conclusion, I think that these amendments are sound, and I am happy to support them. I understand why the Minister has, in response to the Metropolitan police, chosen to extend from 28 to 42 days the transitional period for the implementation of TPIMs, but I hope that he will confirm that there will be scope, subject to security requirements, to allow people subject to TPIMs to undertake work or coursework where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.865.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to say what I hope will be a few words in this debate&#8212;we have been over this territory several times already. I want to place on the record my thanks to the Minister for the inclusive way in which he dealt with the Committee stage and to other Members on both sides of the House who had the opportunity to contribute. It is not often that people feel able to take such a role in Committee, and I think that the Bill was all the better scrutinised because of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.0/2">The Minister knows how strongly and personally I and my right hon. and hon. Friends feel about this matter, and the debate in Committee was nuanced and balanced. It was not simply about seeking draconian powers to last for ever as part of an anti-civil libertarian agenda. The debate has genuinely been driven by the concern of Members on both sides of the House for our national security and by the recognition that in Olympic year, when the eyes of the world will be upon London and when there will therefore be a heightened threat, the pressures on the capacity and ability of the security services and police to deal with some of the most dangerous people in the country will be significant.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.0/3">The Minister has attempted to meet the arguments by talking about additional resources. We have heard the evidence of DAC Osborne, who said that relocation was probably the single most useful power under the previous regime and that it would take a year to get the assets and surveillance in place, and I think it perfectly legitimate, even at this late stage, to press the Minister on some of the practicalities of how that coverage will be ensured and maintained during the Olympics.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" name="Diana Johnson">the Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson)</phrase> said that those who have signed our amendment obviously have some experience in this field. The Minister has heard today from me, and from his hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40172" name="Mark Field">the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40679" name="Paul Goggins">the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul Goggins)</phrase>, all members of the Intelligence and Security Committee. We all share the same dedication to trying to ensure the security of our country, which is a very serious matter indeed. All we are asking for in our amendment (a) to Lords amendment 11 is to get us over the period in which we face the most heightened threat, which is a simple, straightforward, common-sense thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.0/5">The Government have every right to move to the TPIMs regime. They have a majority in the House, together with their coalition partners. If the Government want to change the law from control orders, they have every right to do that. I am not objecting to that; all I am saying is that, when we face this heightened threat, with pressure upon pressure on our security and police services, is it not basic common sense to say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s tide it over until after the Olympics&#8221;? There will still be a threat&#8212;we will face a threat for years to come&#8212;but it will not be as great as the threat that we face at the time of the Olympics.</p>

	<p pid="a.865.1/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for giving way; she is being generous with her time. If there is a threat, it must obviously be dealt with, but does she not accept that one deals with threats by using the law, in particular the criminal law? We do not always descend into special measures such as those that we are discussing, which have a dangerous tone to them of the unaccountable</p>

	<p pid="a.866.0/1">My hon. Friend has always taken a principled stand on these issues, and I respect him for it. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have recognised that in a tiny number of cases we will not be able to prosecute, because that would lead to disclosure and therefore, because it is based on intelligence, a risk to agents and techniques. I said in Committee that I wanted to see the figure reduced to the smallest irreducible number possible, because I accept that we are talking about special measures that are outwith the normal framework of our legal system and transparent justice. I therefore accept my hon. Friend&#8217;s concern, but it is the case, I am afraid to say, that there are people who pose a significant and substantial threat to us who cannot be prosecuted at the current time, and some measures have to be taken to protect the public against them. None of us goes down this path with relish. I have said it before, but let me say to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase>, who intervened earlier, that this is not a matter of Labour Members rubbing their hands with glee and wanting to put people under house arrest. Rather, it is about saying, &#8220;What is the absolute necessity to protect the public?&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.866.1/1">I very much support most of what the right hon. Lady is saying. None of us in this House wants control orders or TPIMs, but we do not have a choice. However, it is much better that we legislate for these matters and deal with them properly under the law, rather than have what happens in some nations, where people are just lifted and then disappear. That is what we are trying to do. The people concerned are very dangerous&#8212;or apparently very dangerous: we cannot prove it, but we do not want to take the risk&#8212;and I am afraid that we have to put up with this lack of liberty.</p>

He understands that, although we are all reluctant to go down this path, on occasion it is necessary.

	<p pid="a.867.0/1">I do not accept the premise that the TPIMs regime will be more effective. DAC Osborne said in evidence that control orders were effective, that the police were used to dealing with them and that relocation was the single most useful power. He also said that control orders provided not only surveillance, but disruption, and were therefore more effective. DAC Osborne recognised that the TPIMs regime would involve a greater level of risk. The Minister said that that risk would be dealt with by the extra resources. We must wait and see, but the police themselves said that, far from being more effective, the move from control orders to TPIMs would be less effective because it would increase the measure of risk.</p>

	<p pid="a.867.1/2">In view of all the risks that will face us next year and the fact that an entirely new system is being introduced involving additional officers, can my right hon.

	<p pid="a.867.2/1">I am afraid that this is one of the rare occasions when I cannot help my right hon. Friend. I cannot for the life of me think why, if I were a Minister faced with this level of risk and if I had a practical solution that would not cost me a great deal of extra money, I would not seek the House&#8217;s agreement to an extension of the transitional period as a precautionary, preventative measure, just to get us through what I believe will be a time of heightened risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.867.2/2">I am grateful to the Minister for placing information from the police in the Library to reassure us about their readiness, but I want to ask him a question. What provision exists to cover the&#8212;possibly&#8212;six people who are currently subject to control orders and to relocation provisions, and who are likely to return to London? In Committee, I raised an issue that has still not been resolved. Paragraph 1 of schedule 1 allows a TPIM to be applied which specifies a residence where a person must reside, but paragraph 3 contains a power to exclude a person from a locality. I believe that there is still a contradiction between a person&#8217;s right to reside at his or her own residence and the power that would allow that person to be excluded from, for example, east London. What if the person&#8217;s residence is in east London? Which power will have priority, the power to exclude under paragraph 3 or the power relating to residence in paragraph 1?</p>
	<p pid="a.867.2/3">I have still not received an answer to my question, and I am very worried about the position. If those six people, many of whom may well have residences in east London, choose to live there, will the TPIMs regime</p>
	<p pid="a.867.2/4">include a power to exclude them from a broader area than the locality in which the Olympics will take place? I should appreciate a clear answer from the Minister today. If it is necessary for me to write to him I shall certainly do so, but I should be reassured if he could give me that further information.</p>

	<p pid="a.868.4/1">Let me explain why I oppose amendment (a), and explain to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" name="Diana Johnson">the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson)</phrase> why she is hearing opposing voices not only from members of the two parties on the Government Benches, but from members of Opposition parties including her own. The reason is that the amendment is entirely without merit. It appears to constitute a rather unfair and somewhat unprincipled assertion that the Minister is playing fast and loose with the security of the nation, notwithstanding the protestation that of course we are all trying to make things secure and do what is in the country&#8217;s best interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.868.4/2">In her rather brief contribution, the shadow Minister gave nary a reason why the Minister&#8217;s position is not the correct approach to take. All the speeches we have heard rely on a solitary piece of evidence provided in Committee, but surely hon. Members on both sides of the House will understand that the Minister has been in extensive discussions subsequently and that the most important consideration must be the one that he put forward today, which is that effective arrangements are in place. That would be the most important consideration if we were dealing with a normal piece of legislation, but in fact we are dealing with a change to one of the most pernicious pieces of legislation that our country has had in recent times&#8212;the legislation on control orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.868.4/3">The shadow Minister&#8217;s amendment is merely further evidence that the Opposition have not yet reconciled their conscience on this issue, nor on the fact that they took a wrecking ball to the rights and liberties that this country has held strongly and to its heart for many years.

Some of us feel that that number can be reconciled only when it is zero and that everyone in this country has the right to a trial before they are imprisoned for extensive periods.</p>

	<p pid="a.869.0/1">I entirely recognise the sincerity of what my hon. Friend says and I, too, have many civil libertarian sympathies, but does he not recognise that this regime is not all that much different from the control order regime that it seeks to replace?</p>

	<p pid="a.869.1/1">Without getting into the details, Mr Deputy Speaker, I can say that of course many of us would like to go further. The Minister and I have had disagreements on this, but in conclusion may I commend him on the way in which he has seen the passage of this Bill through? I hope that in future we may be able to go further.</p>

	<p pid="a.869.2/1">I shall be brief, Mr Deputy Speaker, because I know that the House is anxious to vote on this matter. I wish to draw the Minister&#8217;s attention to the evidence on the Olympics given this morning by Her Majesty&#8217;s inspector of constabulary to the Select Committee on Home Affairs. He called for a central hub to be created to police the Olympics, bringing together resources, intelligence and other aspects of policing. He and others felt that that was necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.2/2">On the questions raised by others concerning TPIMs and control orders, of course there is concern that some of these individuals will be allowed to return to London just as the Olympics are beginning, and the Government need to monitor the situation carefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.2/3">My final point relates to the request for thousands of additional volunteers to come forward to police the Olympics&#8212;there is talk of 10,000 people. All I urge is that they are properly trained before they take on their responsibilities. I am sure that the Minister is conscious of the importance of the Olympics. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40417" name="Patrick Mercer">The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase> was right to have raised it, and I hope that the Government will bear it in mind when we consider the resources and practicalities of the next few months.</p>

	<p pid="a.869.3/1">This has been a useful debate in the latter stages of the Bill&#8217;s consideration in both Houses. I am conscious of time and recognise that the Opposition might wish to press their amendment to a vote, so I need to be swift in my summation, for which I apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.3/2">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40152" name="Tom Brake">the Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake)</phrase> highlighted issues regarding the police reporting requirement. We have looked into this very carefully, including the need for appropriateness. In other words, a constable, in giving directions, must be reasonable, necessary and proportionate in his or her approach in this regard. I hope that gives him some assurance regarding the manner in which the directions power will be undertaken. I appreciate his long-standing interest in these matters and his desire to ensure they are dealt with in a reasoned and appropriate way.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.3/3">Let me address the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" name="Diana Johnson">the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson)</phrase> about the availability of information to the independent reviewer. I shall certainly look at the <i>Hansard</i> report of her comments because we want to ensure that the independent reviewer has all the information appropriate to be able to do his work and to report, as has happened with the independent reviewer in relation to control orders. I shall consider her requests regarding those issues to ensure that we are equipping the independent reviewer with all the appropriate information to enable him to conduct his duties in an effective manner and report to the House, as I am sure right hon. and hon. Members would expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.3/4">On preparedness, I know why <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40517" name="Hazel Blears">the right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears)</phrase>, who was a Minister at the time of the appalling 7/7 incident, takes these issues so very seriously and is so focused. However, she will equally understand that I am limited as to what it is appropriate for me to say in the House about operational and practical issues in relation to specific arrangements for individuals. I understand her questioning but I hope she will appreciate that, in terms of capability and other issues linked to the work of the police and the Security Service, it is not, unfortunately, appropriate for me to respond to her fully in this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.3/5">The right hon. Lady highlighted an issue in relation to the compatibility of individual aspects of the schedule. Clearly, the exclusion measure would not be used to exclude the individual from, for example, the street in which he or she lives. The notice must be enforceable and the measures will need to be applied sensibly. They will be put in place only where restrictions are necessary, so one measure cannot cut across another&#8212;there needs to be consistency, one measure with the other. However, I shall reflect on whether further clarification is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.3/6">In essence, we return to the issue of preparedness. I have said that it will take time to realise fully some of the benefits from additional resources, but the key issue for me is that at the point of transition to the new TPIM arrangements, effective arrangements will be in place. That has been our focus in our discussions with the police and the Security Service, whom I thank for their work not only in relation to preparations for the Bill but for keeping us safe each and every day.</p>

	<p pid="a.876.3/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.876.3/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House does not insist on their Amendment No. 47 to which the Lords have disagreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.876.3/3">Following consideration of Commons amendments in the other place last Wednesday, hon. Members will know that the Government no longer intend to abolish the Youth Justice Board as part of the Bill. Therefore, I will not be asking hon. Members to insist on the Government amendment agreed by this House on Report. The amendment has reintroduced the Youth Justice Board into schedule 1 to the Bill. As my noble friend Lord McNally made clear in the other place, the Government have never waivered in our commitment to maintaining a distinct focus on the needs of children and young people in the youth justice system. We have never proposed to remove youth offending teams or dismantle the dedicated secure estate for young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.876.4/1">It is an unusual experience for a Committee to publish just after midnight a report containing recommendations that are accepted by midday the following day. As my hon. Friend has mentioned youth offending teams, I wanted to remind him that the Justice Committee, as well as pointing to the dangers of abolishing the Youth Justice Board, stated that if it survived it would have to take a lighter touch and a less centralised approach to the management of youth offending teams than it had taken in the otherwise good work it had done.</p>

	<p pid="a.876.6/1">My hon. Friend will know that many of us welcomed the announcement he has made and the decision the Government took in the other place. We understand that it was a finely balanced issue, because there is a good argument for reducing or eliminating quangos that are not needed, but on balance many of us will be reassured by the decision. I and others hope that the Youth Justice Board will continue its increasingly effective work in delivering a reduction in crime and a reduction in offending by young people.</p>

	<p pid="a.876.7/1">I will touch on my right hon. Friend&#8217;s point later.</p>
	<p pid="a.876.7/2">During the debates on the future of the Youth Justice Board, we set out to persuade Parliament that, now that an effective youth justice system is in place, the oversight provided by the Youth Justice Board was no longer required and direct ministerial accountability for youth justice should be restored. My fellow Under-Secretary of State made that point on Report. However, we acknowledge the opposition to our original proposal to</p>
	<p pid="a.876.7/3">abolish the Youth Justice Board. Its abolition was never about saving money, as the Ministry of Justice does not have major savings contingent on its abolition. In that context, we have decided not to pursue abolition using powers provided in the Public Bodies Bill. Instead, we will reflect further on the Youth Justice Board&#8217;s future role.</p>
	<p pid="a.876.7/4">I want to make it clear that the Government still believe that there should be more direct ministerial accountability for youth justice, that there is a strong case for the reform of the Youth Justice Board, and that we will consider our options for achieving reform outside the Bill. For example, a range of powers are open to us under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. We will consider whether and how we can use those powers to achieve more direct ministerial accountability.</p>
	<p pid="a.876.7/5">We will also consider the position of the Youth Justice Board within the context of the Cabinet Office&#8217;s policy on public bodies and its stipulation that all non-departmental public bodies should be reviewed at least once every three years. Let me be clear that the Government&#8217;s position on the Youth Justice Board will not be business as usual. Having said that, I assure all right hon. and hon. Members that over this period the Ministry of Justice and the Youth Justice Board have maintained effective working relationships, which will carry on as we take forward proposals for reform. The Government therefore support the motion agreed to in the other place, and I ask that this House does not insist on the amendment agreed to on Report.</p>

	<p pid="a.877.0/1">I am grateful to the Minister for his degree of elegance in basically climbing down from the Government&#8217;s previous position.</p>
	<p pid="a.877.0/2">Our position all along&#8212;particularly in the shadow of this summer&#8217;s riots, which involved many young people&#8212;has been that it is essential not to make precipitate decisions on how we handle youth justice. We continually warned that it would not be appropriate effectively to abolish the Youth Justice Board, which continues to do such excellent work, but that does not mean that it should not be reformed from time to time, or at least reviewed.</p>
	<p pid="a.877.0/3">I therefore welcome the progress made in the other place on the YJB, which I am glad to see has now been removed from the Bill, but I have some reservations about the Minister&#8217;s comments just now, and especially those made in the other place by the noble Lord McNally, who, when speaking about the future of the board, said that</p>
	<p pid="a.877.0/4">&#8220;there is a strong case for the reform of the YJB, and we will consider our options for achieving reform outside the Public Bodies Bill.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2011-11-23.1074"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 November 2011; Vol. 732, c. 1074</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.877.0/5">The Minister&#8217;s words today were almost a precise repetition of that, and it sounds like a threat. It sounds as though the Government have made up their mind, and that what we have heard today is not so much a climb-down as a temporary retreat in order to attempt to do on another occasion the same thing that they intended to do in this Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.877.1/1">I get the impression that the shadow Minister is of the opinion that in this case any reform is unacceptable, and that the Government&#8217;s new line is just about doing the same thing but in another way. Is he against any reform?</p>

	<p pid="a.878.0/1">If the hon. Gentleman had listened, he would have heard that I am not at all against reform or continual review, as no organisation ought to be. As events change, and as our understanding of crime and youth justice develops, as it will do over time, no doubt the YJB and other ancillary bodies will be reviewed, but it looks to me very much as if the Government have dogmatically made up their mind that the board must change and, in effect, be abolished.</p>

	<p pid="a.878.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the Youth Justice Board has done fantastic work to date, for which it should be commended? The fact that it is not going to be abolished is a positive move. In terms of reform, youth offending teams will have to manage with smaller resources and teams, and it will be under incredible pressure, so does he also agree that the YJB is going to have to change the way in which it works, if only to respond to that?</p>

	<p pid="a.878.2/1">I totally agree with my hon. Friend, who makes a powerful point. No doubt there is financial pressure on all public services, and probably rightly so given the climate in which we all live, but the truth is that dealing with justice and, in particular, with protecting the interests of young people is an important and primary function of government, so we ought not to make decisions in haste or for purely financial imperatives.</p>

	<p pid="a.878.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his moderate and considerate response to the Minister. My analysis is that there was strong support in both Houses and across the parties for the Youth Justice Board, so it is unfair to come to the conclusion that the hon. Gentleman implies, specifically because Lord McNally in the other place said:</p>
	<p pid="a.878.3/2">&#8220;We will consider whether we can use these powers in the context of a more direct ministerial responsibility but will do so in consultation with the Youth Justice Board and with the intention of working harmoniously with it.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2011-11-23.1074"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 November 2011; Vol. 732, c. 1074</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="a.878.4/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his comments and for the moderate way he expressed them. We will see over time exactly what the Government&#8217;s intentions are.</p>
	<p pid="a.878.4/2">The Government have set out to remove the independence of the youth justice system. The Minister repeated that they want, in effect, to bring it under direct ministerial accountability. There is no financial case that I can see for what the Government are trying to do. I have reservations about something as important as the operation of the criminal justice system, whether or not it deals with young people, being brought under ministerial direction. That is not a debate to be had this afternoon because the Government have withdrawn the proposal. However, any attempt to bring the criminal justice system under direct ministerial accountability will be resisted in this Chamber and in the other place, because it is a long-established tradition that the criminal justice system should, as far as possible, operate independently of the Executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.878.4/3">The Government have not recognised the case for independence. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">the Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase> said in Committee, the Government are committed to bringing the YJB under the remit of central Government. It is, in effect, a nationalisation. The Government want to nationalise the criminal justice system, whereas we want to defend its independence, as one would expect. In my view, none of the YJB&#8217;s core functions will be able to be carried out within central Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.878.4/4">I do not wish to repeat all the arguments that have been debated elsewhere, but I simply urge the Government to keep in mind, in whatever review they carry out in future, that the independence of youth justice and of the criminal justice system in general needs to be maintained. After all, as has been widely acknowledged, the YJB does an amazing job. It has reduced youth offending, it has protected young people, and on the whole it has made the youth justice system better. In Committee, the YJB was praised, as it has been here today and was in the Lords the other week, by Members on both sides. I am glad that the Government have now recognised formally that it does invaluable work, and that they have withdrawn this proposal. We look forward to seeing in due course whatever the Government do next in relation to this matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.879.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40309" name="Jon Trickett">The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> is slightly confusing the very necessary and important independence of the courts with the status of a body such as the Youth Justice Board. The Executive are, and must be, accountable to Parliament for the efficient provision of things such as custody and alternatives to custody. They may choose to do this by way of a semi-independent or arm&#8217;s length body, but that is much more an administrative decision than a decision about judicial independence, for example. The two concepts are different and should not be confused.</p>
	<p pid="a.879.0/2">I rise to underline and clarify the points made by the Justice Committee in its 10th report, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-23">23 November</phrase>, just after midnight. In that report, we set out our concerns about what would happen if the Youth Justice Board was abolished and what the Ministry of Justice would have to do in order to ensure that youth justice got the focus that the YJB had given it in the good work that it had done. We also set out what needs to happen in the circumstances in which we now find ourselves, whereby the Government have taken the decision not to abolish the YJB. Our concern was that one of the YJB&#8217;s weak points&#8212;perhaps the only one that came out strongly in evidence&#8212;was that quite a lot of people working in the sector felt that it was too &#8220;top down&#8221; in its approach to youth offending teams. The success that we have seen in the youth justice field has been achieved by youth offending teams bringing together every agency at local level and working together. That has been encouraged and supported by the YJB. However, the YJB itself told us that its oversight of youth offending teams will be lighter touch in future and that it is working to</p>
	<p pid="a.879.0/3">&#8220;promote peer support and allow more room for professional judgement&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.879.0/4">That lesson needs to be learned. Indeed, when the Minister gave evidence to us, he gave examples from his own experience to underline that that approach was necessary. He also set out his own case for having greater ministerial accountability and greater ministerial awareness of what the YJB is doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.879.0/5">The Youth Justice Board will continue. Many people will welcome that because it has provided a very specific focus and enabled things to be achieved in the youth justice field that have not been achieved in the rest of the criminal justice system. There has been a much better understanding of where to strike a balance between custody and alternatives to custody in youth justice than in other fields. There has also been much better local co-operation between the various agencies that deal with young people. We need to build on those experiences.</p>
	<p pid="a.879.0/6">I wish the board well in the future. However, I underline the point that the Select Committee made in its report and hope that Ministers have noted it.</p>

	<p pid="a.880.0/1">If I may, I will add a couple of brief comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/2">First, I am grateful to the Government for listening and responding positively, constructively and graciously, as my noble friend Lord McNally did in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-23">23 November</phrase>. I also thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> for his work and that of the Justice Committee in looking at this issue and putting their wisdom on the table, ready for whatever decision the Government made. That wisdom is just as valid and can still be picked up by the Youth Justice Board and the Government in the circumstances that the Government have announced.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/3">Lord McNally made clear one reason for this decision:</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/4">&#8220;The other point that has come through in contribution after contribution is that the real influence and power in all this has been the reputation of the YJB itself. It has been able to call on friends in its time of need because of that reputation.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2011-11-23.1074"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 23 November 2011; Vol. 732, c. 1074</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/5">I associate myself with those whom I call parliamentary friends from across the parties, Lord Warner, who was the midwife&#8212;if that is not an inappropriate gender assignation&#8212;at the birth of the Youth Justice Board, Lord Elton, Baroness Linklater, Baroness Scotland and others. They have made it clear that although at the beginning it was not evident that the board would be hugely successful, it became more and more successful. I join in the thanks and the tributes to Frances Done, the chair of the Youth Justice Board, and to John Drew, its chief executive.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/6">My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed was right to point to the evidence on the ground of the success of youth offending teams and of that model. The figures, given all the trends in crime, have been extraordinary and have gone in the other direction. Youth crime has come down significantly. Sometimes we are confronted by campaigns or arguments in our local papers which suggest that youth crime is out of control and that youngsters are running amok. That is absolutely not evidence-based. In England, the figures have gone in the other direction. That is a tribute to those who have worked on the ground in youth offending teams, in collaboration with the local police and local authorities; those who work in the youth service, who do a valuable job; and those who have been on the Youth Justice Board over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/7">I wish to pay one tribute that I may not be thanked for, although I hope that I will be. Steven Bradford, who used to work with me in the House of Commons, went</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/8">on to work in the Youth Justice Board. He was a wise and useful researcher when he worked here. The Youth Justice Board has been well served by a group of people like him who have been loyal and committed to an important part of public policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.880.0/9">The Youth Justice Board has the confidence of young people, the confidence of the agencies that work with young people&#8212;Lord Ramsbotham is another person who was clear in his support of the Youth Justice Board&#8212;and the confidence of all those who watch these matters and seek a better penal policy. I hope that today is not regarded as a defeat for the Government, but as the Government understanding that it is right for the Youth Justice Board to go on. It will, of course, always be subject to review and it is right that Ministers have to answer in this place for the success of justice policies, whether in relation to adults or young people. They have done in the past and they will do in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.881.0/1">I will briefly address the points that have been made, because I know that we have to move on to the next debate. First, I point out the consensus that there is in support of our position. I thank right hon. and hon. Members for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.881.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40309" name="Jon Trickett">The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> made a point about nationalisation. I am not quite sure what he was getting at. He seemed to suggest that we should go back to business as usual. That is not our position. It is true that the YJB has done good work, as was pointed out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40583" name="Robert Flello">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>. However, it does need reform, as has been acknowledged by nearly all speakers.</p>
	<p pid="a.881.0/3">We established a YJB transition programme at an early stage, to cover three strands of work: abolition, the moving of YJB corporate services to the Ministry of Justice, and the restructuring of YJB staff. The second and third of those strands will go ahead whether or not abolition takes place. It is difficult to disentangle the costs and attribute accurate costs to each, but that is the current position.</p>
	<p pid="a.881.0/4">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>, who explained his concern and, I believe, that of his Committee, that the YJB&#8217;s approach is too top-down. I assure him that I will take that point back to the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40496" name="Crispin Blunt">the Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt)</phrase>, to help him in considering the options for reform before he brings forward his proposals in due course.</p>

	<p pid="a.881.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.881.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House does not insist on their Amendment No. 53 to which the Lords have disagreed and agrees to amendments 53A to 53C proposed by the Lords in lieu of that Amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.881.2/3">Under Commons amendment 53, we would have retained the office of the chief coroner in statute but transferred its functions to the Lord Chief Justice and the Lord Chancellor. However, we recognised the desire to have a single judicial figure responsible for leading the coroner system, a view that was expressed in both Houses and by a range of stakeholders. We therefore tabled further amendments in the Lords that would allow us to implement the office of the chief coroner without delay and bring into force the range of chief coroner powers envisaged under part 1 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009.</p>
	<p pid="a.881.2/4">We will not, however, implement the appeals provision under section 40 of the 2009 Act, which will be repealed. That will leave in place the existing system of redress, so that decisions can still be contested by way of judicial review or by application to the High Court by, or under the authority of, the Attorney-General.</p>

	<p pid="a.882.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move an amendment, to leave out &#8220;agrees&#8221; and insert &#8220;disagrees&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">This is a similar debate to the last one, in the sense that the Government have now withdrawn an unreasonable proposal. The truth is, of course, that they did not have a majority in the other place to deliver either proposal, so although some good grace has been shown, there are also mathematical reasons to do with how the votes were going to go in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.0/3">Hopefully, Members will never have recourse to the coronial system as a result of a sudden unexplained death of a loved one. We can all imagine that if we did, we would probably be in a difficult emotional condition. We would hope that we would be helped in discovering the true courses of that sudden and tragic death by a modern, professional, strong and independent-minded coroner.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.0/4">Unfortunately, there have been too many cases reported in which the families, friends and colleagues of a loved one have felt let down by the coronial service that they have received. I do not need to dwell on the many occasions when the service was felt to have failed, but it became clear that the whole coronial service needed to be modernised, made more professional and above all made more accountable.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.0/5">The Opposition are totally in favour of modernising public services that need to be modernised. We are in favour of reform, and I will not have anything else said. The view that the coronial service needs to be reformed and made more accountable is not simply that of a few party hacks in this place or elsewhere. It is the view of, for example, the Royal British Legion and of Inquest, an organisation of which many Members will have heard. Between them, those organisations represent many bereaved families, including the families of our fallen heroes. So I have been perplexed throughout the Bill&#8217;s progress by the Government&#8217;s continuing failure to respond, not to our arguments, but to the voices of the bereaved and those who represent them, to the extent that, as the House knows, the Bill Committee</p>
	<p pid="a.882.0/6">refused to allow witnesses from the Royal British Legion to appear before it so that we could hear what they had to say on behalf of those families.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.0/7">In the previous Parliament, it became the settled will of this House and the other place that the way to achieve far-reaching reform of the whole coronial service should be&#8212;at least in part&#8212;through establishing a new post, the chief coroner. The chief coroner&#8217;s tasks were well debated at the time and I will not rehearse them. Then, there was a change of Government and, bizarrely, as part of their review of quangos, this Administration decided to abolish the post of chief coroner, notwithstanding the fact that that post is not a quango. We repeatedly warned that that would be a major error and we therefore fully support the Government&#8217;s decision to take the office of chief coroner out of schedule 5, thereby securing the post&#8217;s existence.</p>
	<p pid="a.882.0/8">I am happy that the hard work of organisations such as the British Legion and Inquest, as well as that of many individuals, has finally paid off.</p>

	<p pid="a.883.0/1">Like my hon. Friend, I supported the British Legion&#8217;s campaign throughout the Bill&#8217;s passage. I want to put something on the record briefly. Many representatives of faith communities in the city of Leicester have approached me because of their concerns that coronial services need to be improved across the piece and be sensitive to faith communities&#8217; needs. I wanted to put that to the Minister, but he was speedier than I anticipated. Does my hon. Friend agree that representatives of faith communities should sit on the bereavement committee that the Minister is establishing to advise on those matters?</p>

	<p pid="a.883.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who played a distinguished role throughout the Committee&#8217;s proceedings and spoke on Second Reading and on Third Reading. I know that he pays close attention to such matters as a hard-working constituency representative in the city of Leicester. I agree with his points.</p>
	<p pid="a.883.1/2">Let me outline the reasons why we felt uncomfortable with the direction that the Government were taking. We heard that they were going to perform a fairly undignified climb-down on the post of chief coroner, and it looked like a wholesale victory, but, as is becoming the Government&#8217;s custom, the announcement was not made in this House or the other place, but to the media. We heard about it on the BBC the night before the Bill went into Committee in the other place. I think that that is deplorable.</p>
	<p pid="a.883.1/3">Many people were misled into saying that it was a wholesale victory for common sense and that the Government had finally listened. However, when we saw the detail of the proposals, it immediately became clear that there was a flaw at their centre. The Government have decided not to delete the post of chief coroner&#8212;we welcome that&#8212;but they have also decided, as the Minister just said, to repeal section 40 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. That means that there will be no right of appeal against a coroner&#8217;s decision&#8212;as we have heard, from time to time, those decisions are contested&#8212;to the chief coroner, as the House originally intended.</p>
	<p pid="a.883.1/4">The Government know perfectly well that there is no need to repeal section 40, which will allow for appeals in due course, since the 2009 Act understood that such action had to be taken carefully. A procedure was</p>
	<p pid="a.883.1/5">therefore put in place so that the process of appealing to the chief coroner would not be invoked until the Secretary of State allowed that to happen. We strongly believe that that should continue. In effect, the removal of the right of appeal will reduce the office of the chief coroner to an administrative post with limited oversight of the coronial system, and that is to be regretted. We agree with Inquest, which has circulated a note to all hon. Members today, that section 40 of the original Act should be retained and that a pilot for the appeals procedure could then be undertaken by the chief coroner when the post is filled. That review could be undertaken alongside the Ministry of Justice&#8217;s review. That would allow the Government to make an informed decision on how to proceed with reform of the coronial system. It seems that the Government are unwilling to make an informed decision, but have just decided, dogmatically, that there will be no appeals system. I strongly believe that a pilot would prove beyond doubt the efficacy of a national appeals system to the chief coroner. Why on earth would the Government withdraw that power? It is baffling.</p>
	<p pid="a.883.1/6">Now we turn to the reason that the Government have given for the abolition of the right of appeal. The argument has been made in different ways at different times by various Ministers. They have tended to talk about saving money. I will not dwell on the issue of trying to save money by failing to have a proper review of how people may have lost their lives. It is hard to argue that we should save money in such an important area. Be that as it may, the Government have talked about saving money, but their costings are based on an analysis from 2008 and show a total saving&#8212;from doing away with the whole chief coroner system&#8212;of only &#163;6.5 million. However, the estimated saving on the appeals process alone was only &#163;1.5 million. That is a lot of money, but the saving estimate fails to take into account the likely additional costs that will arise if the Government have their way today and the appeals system is abolished.</p>
	<p pid="a.883.1/7">The problem is that if aggrieved parties are denied the right of appeal to the chief coroner, they will seek judicial review, as the Minister confirmed. I suggest that the cost to the taxpayer of abolishing the appeal process will therefore be far greater than the savings made.</p>

	<p pid="a.884.0/1">The hon.

	<p pid="a.884.1/1">Of course it is, and I am baffled by that intervention, given that I have just said that section 40 allows for an appeals system to be introduced in due course. What was envisaged was a proper coronial system with an appeals process and a chief coroner who would have authority over the whole system. The Government are seeking to stop that logical process, which could be tested first by a pilot, and to put in an illogical system, with a chief coroner who would effectively be reduced to a purely administrative post.</p>
	<p pid="a.884.1/2">In response to a series of parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests, Ministers have revealed that at no stage have the Government estimated the likely costs of additional judicial reviews, as opposed to an appeals system. On that basis, it is odd to argue that savings will be inherent in this decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.885.0/1">Surely having a right of appeal would just mean more cost and delay. The really important role that the coroner has had historically is to make a judgment and provide closure. Is not that the most important of the coroner&#8217;s responsibilities?</p>

	<p pid="a.885.1/1">The two interventions have been revealing. Both interventions, and the Minister&#8217;s original speech, envisage more judicial reviews taking place in the absence of a proper and orderly appeals process. The problem with judicial review is that it is more expensive than the appeals system. It can take years and it is burdensome, bureaucratic and emotionally painful to the bereaved families. The average cost to an individual is &#163;30,000. We are talking about people, such as families of service men and women, who may want to contest the decisions of a coroner. Under clause 40 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, there is a simple system that allows for an appeal to the chief coroner, which would create a precedent for the whole coronial service. Rather than that, the Government are resting their case on the fact that the appeal process will go through judicial review. That is not an appropriate way in which to handle a very sensitive service.</p>

	<p pid="a.885.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again. He is being typically generous and kind. Judicial review is not a form of appeal. Sometimes it is used as collateral challenge, but it is not a form of appeal. It is used when there has been a procedural irregularity. The key message must be that the whole point of the coroner system is to get closure so that people can move on with their lives. A person has to get leave to apply for judicial review, and they must show that there has been some procedural irregularity or proper grounds for that kind of action to be taken.</p>

	<p pid="a.885.3/1">The British Legion, which is closer to any of the service families than we are, says that it would prefer an appeals system. The hon.

It is better to defer to the judgment of the British Legion.</p>

	<p pid="a.885.5/1">I will not take any more interventions because there are other people who wish to catch the Deputy Speaker&#8217;s eye. The Government clearly want judicial review, but the problem is that it is a complex system. We will have the individual coroner&#8217;s court, the chief coroner and then the intervention of the judiciary through judicial review. It is a complicated administrative and legal process. Families who are bereaved and who simply do not understand what happened to their loved one want an explanation and the matter to be brought to closure. A judicial review can take years before an issue is resolved and cost tens of thousands of pounds.</p>

	<p pid="a.886.1/1">There may be some judicial reviews under the chief coroner, but they will be fewer in number. It will be a far more efficient system. At the end of the day, we want to do what the families want. The families are saying to us&#8212;the British Legion questioned individual families&#8212;that they do not want what the Government are trying to achieve. If the Government&#8217;s reasoning is to save money, it would be more efficient, better emotionally and cheaper to allow section 40 to remain on the statute book so that a decision can be made in the fullness of time, with all the options having been carefully considered.</p>
	<p pid="a.886.1/2">It has been suggested that removing the right of appeal, which was in the original Act and which the Government now wish to achieve, will effectively neuter the role of the chief coroner. More sinister than that is a rumour that is now circulating that the Government intend simply to fail to fill the post of chief coroner. Will the Minister now tell the House when he intends to fill that post?</p>

	<p pid="a.886.4/1">I shall try to keep my remarks as brief as possible. I begin by welcoming the decision&#8212;I will not call it a climbdown&#8212;to retain the post of chief coroner. I moved an amendment in this place to reinstate the post, and in that vote I was grateful for the support of the Labour Front-Bench team and some of my hon. Friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.886.4/2">It is important to rehearse one or two of the arguments, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40309" name="Jon Trickett">the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> did, about why we need this reform and why Conservative Members, at the time, supported the creation of the post of chief coroner. There have been numerous examples of people and families receiving appalling and disgusting treatment at the hands of the coronial system. On Report, I mentioned a couple of such examples, and consequently, since then, other people in my area have come forward with their own examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.886.4/3">We agreed, therefore, that there was a definite need for the reform and for the post of chief coroner. Of course, had the post been filled before this all started, we would not be in such a weak position, having advanced that argument. Nevertheless, I welcome the decision&#8212;whatever the reason&#8212;to reinstate the post. I look forward to hearing from the Minister, who tried to intervene on the Opposition spokesman, when exactly the post will be filled. One of the reasons I wanted to speak was to get an answer to that question.</p>

	<p pid="a.887.1/1">I thank the Minister for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/2">The question of the appeals process is not quite as simple or clear-cut as has been presented. Despite referring to the appeals process when I moved my amendment a few weeks ago, it was not one of the main drivers behind my joining the campaign. The fact that under the previous legislation it was accepted that the process would not start for some time demonstrates the difficulties that arise. There is the perception or concern that some people might use the appeals process almost to continue the grieving process. Members have talked about getting closure, but actually the appeals process can postpone that closure, which can be difficult for families.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.1/3">I understand, therefore, that this is a difficult issue. The Opposition spokesperson made a sensible proposal&#8212;about having a trial&#8212;but that is not necessarily the answer, because, as the Minister said, those decisions can be judicially reviewed. The key point about the chief coroner was his role in driving the necessary reforms, which can continue with or without the appeals process.</p>

	<p pid="a.887.2/1">Is not one of the key points about the chief coroner, as envisaged by the Minister, that he will be responsible for training and monitoring? My hon.

	<p pid="a.887.3/1">Of course, the position was created precisely to drive that top-down change and to ensure that people&#8217;s experience of the coronial system was even and equal across the country. That is the element that we have to focus on. We have to accept that we are where we are&#8212;the other place has determined the matter&#8212;and that there will be no changes to the appeals process, although I hope that the Minister will not take that possibility off the table permanently. Perhaps we could reconsider that matter further down the line.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.3/2">We now need to focus on getting the position filled and driving forward that change. I welcome the position that we are in, and I join the Opposition Front-Bench team in paying tribute to the role of the Royal British Legion, as well as organisations such as Inquest and, interestingly, the British Medical Association, which supported, and continues to support, the post of chief coroner. The Royal British Legion has done an exceptional amount of work in raising the matter and doggedly fighting for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.3/3">This is also a question of our commitment to the covenant. Obviously it is not just service personnel families who are affected, but they are uppermost in our minds when we think about the post.</p>
	<p pid="a.887.3/4">I welcome the fact that we have this position again. I hope that the appointment will be made as quickly as possible and that the genuine change that all of us, in all parts of the House, have agreed needs to be made, is indeed made. Finally, let me again make a plea to the Minister to consider the appeals process in due course, although I fully accept the complex nature of such appeals.</p>

	<p pid="a.888.0/1">Let me begin by adding my praise to Inquest, the Royal British Legion and a host of other organisations, which are almost too numerous to mention, that have been behind the campaign to ensure that the Government finally saw sense on refilling the post of chief coroner&#8212;not appointing someone to the post, because it was filled. Somebody was appointed, but then, shall we say, let go. I also pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40119" name="Andrew Percy">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase> for the work that he did, which is much appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.0/2">I am extremely disappointed that, having been told time and again, and shown the error of their ways, the Government waited until the 11th hour&#8212;or not quite the 11th hour: it was probably around half past 7&#8212;finally to change their mind. However, they then behaved like a small child. Having been found out, they now want to kick the toys around spitefully. Section 40 can be introduced over time, in a measured way, using pilots. However, simply saying, &#8220;Okay, have the chief coroner, but you can&#8217;t have appeals,&#8221; looks petulant and leaves the Minister and the Ministry of Justice looking stupid. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Allow me to rephrase that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I did not mean for a moment to say that the Minister looked stupid; however, the stupidity of the actions stands out.</p>
	<p pid="a.888.0/3">Inquest has said as recently as today that it envisages that section 40 would</p>
	<p pid="a.888.0/4">&#8220;remain on the statute book until, at a time to be agreed in the future, the provision would be brought into force by the Secretary of State under section l82 of the Act so a full pilot and review of the appeals process could be undertaken by the Chief Coroner.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.888.0/5">That is totally sensible. Inquest continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.888.0/6">&#8220;This would enable a properly costed, informed decision to be taken about rolling out a new avenue of appeal across coroners courts in England and Wales. Terms of the pilot and review would be decided between the Chief Coroner and the Ministry of Justice and, under our proposal&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.888.0/7">the proposal put forward by Inquest and RBL&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.888.0/8">&#8220;an appeals process would not come into effect for several years.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.888.0/9">All that is eminently doable, and to say otherwise is frankly wrong. Inquest continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.888.0/10">&#8220;An appeals process overseen by the chief coroner would offer families a route to resolve poor decision making.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.888.2/3">&#8220;poor decision-making by coroners before and during the course of the inquest so that any legal questions on these points could be dealt with quickly and efficiently. Currently, the only avenue of appeal for bereaved families about the decision-making of coroners and their conduct of an inquest is through judicial review which, as well as being expensive and complex, will often result in lengthy delays and adjourned inquest hearings while the issue is dealt with by the High Court.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.888.2/4">Let me give a quick example. Sheila Taylor bravely came to this House and spoke at a meeting with Inquest on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-20">20 October</phrase>, following the tragic death of her son Mike, in April 2007. She says, among many other deeply poignant things:</p>
	<p pid="a.888.2/5">&#8220;The Coroner&#8217;s Office didn&#8217;t inform us that we had a right to be present at the post-mortem. That had already been done before we were informed of Mike&#8217;s death, which made us suspicious. Was there some sort of cover-up? Had he been murdered? Had he been given the wrong drugs? The Coroner&#8217;s Officer was so rude in response to our questioning that we had to get our solicitor to speak to him on our behalf. We decided we needed a second toxicology report, but that caused a delay of 8 weeks before we could hold the funeral. You can imagine how upsetting that was.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.888.2/6">We can also imagine how upsetting it is for a family who have something that they are not happy about&#8212;indeed, something they have deep concerns about&#8212;but for whom the only avenue currently open is the judicial review approach, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> said. Families such as the Taylors have to decide whether they want their son&#8217;s funeral delayed even further and the coroner to take even longer to look at their case, while they go through the expensive and lengthy process of judicial review. It does not need be like that.</p>

	<p pid="a.889.0/1">The hon. Gentleman was kind enough to suggest that I was tweeting. In fact, I was looking up the difference between judicial review and section 13 applications under the previous arrangements and section 40 appeals under the current arrangements, and it struck me that there was not much difference between the two. I wonder whether we are actually talking about a slightly illusory right of appeal.</p>

	<p pid="a.889.1/1">Perhaps the hon. Gentleman should go and use a fully sized computer to conduct some proper research, rather than using a small hand-held device in the Chamber, which is probably not allowed by &#8220;Erskine May&#8221; in any case.</p>
	<p pid="a.889.1/2">The Government have previously referred to cost, but&#8212;this has been said several times already, but I shall say it again because it is so important&#8212;the whole cost issue is a nonsense in many respects. Answers to parliamentary questions, responses to freedom of information requests and discussions with the Ministry of Justice have shown that the Government have not analysed the current costs of judicial reviews of coroners&#8217; decisions or made any attempts to ascertain what the future costs might be, and have thus been unable to make any comparison with the section 40 appeals process.</p>
	<p pid="a.889.1/3">If section 40 remains on the statute book, things can be done properly, carefully, steadily and slowly. There is no need for them to be done tomorrow. There is no need to say, as the Minister has, &#8220;We want to ensure that all this can be done quickly, so we must omit section 40.&#8221; I am sorry, but that is wrong, and I suggest that he should read the Act again.</p>
	<p pid="a.889.1/4">I do not know whether the Minister suddenly thought &#8220;We are going to lose at the other end of the Corridor&#8221;, or whether there was a moment on Remembrance Sunday when he stood thinking about the ultimate sacrifice that people had made, and about the small sacrifice that the House could make by doing the right thing. Whatever the reason for his decision, however, I know for certain that he will not want to upset the Whips today, and that he therefore will not tell the House that he will not press the amendment that would remove section 40. That is a tragedy.</p>
	<p pid="a.889.1/5">No doubt the Government will win the vote despite the brave stance of many Government Members, but notwithstanding that victory and notwithstanding the removal of section 40, which I am sure will happen, I ask the Minister to ponder this: he may win the vote, but he will have lost the moral and ethical argument. He will also have lost any chance of being viewed positively by the&#8212;sadly&#8212;tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of bereaved families out there, and those who represent them, who know that section 40 is the answer. He has done the right thing in regard to the chief coroner, for whatever reason, and I now ask him to do the right thing in this regard.</p>

	<p pid="a.890.0/1">I believe that the Minister wants the chief coroner to be able to ensure that coroners are fully trained and know how to deal with issues so that no mistakes are made.

	<p pid="a.890.3/1">I do not disagree with the Minister&#8212;he did say that the Government wanted to provide for training&#8212;but the point was made time and again from the Dispatch Box that there was no need for the chief coroner to do any of the things that were mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40173" name="Stephen Mosley">the hon. Member for City of Chester (Stephen Mosley)</phrase>. Thankfully the Minister has seen sense in that regard. However, if the hon. Gentleman is right and the existence of a chief coroner means that all coroners will finally be up to standard, there will be few if any appeals, so where is the harm in including section 40? I suggest that there is no harm in it at all.</p>

	<p pid="a.890.6/1">The Select Committee on Justice has taken extensive evidence on the failings in the coronial system and the need for reform. We felt strongly that there should be a chief coroner and I continued to press that argument with Ministers on many occasions. The Government found alternative ways of trying to achieve the same things, and it would be wrong to suggest that in their use of the powers of the Lord Chief Justice they were not hoping to achieve significant reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.6/2">Clearly there is consensus about reform. Anyone who has seen the experience of families who have had delayed inquests or poor service from coroner&#8217;s offices, and who</p>
	<p pid="a.890.6/3">is aware of the completely patchwork system of support for coroners around the country, realises that fundamental reform is required. That can now be achieved through the office of chief coroner, which I felt all along was the sensible way to do it. That involves professional leadership, training and tackling the jurisdictional issues so that, for example, the chief coroner can move inquests to a coroner who is in a position to provide the service when there is too much pressure in another coronial area.</p>
	<p pid="a.890.6/4">Where there is not consensus is on the appeal issue. I know how strongly the Royal British Legion feels about that and I respect its campaign, but significant legal questions are raised by whether we substitute the decision of one coroner for that of another&#8212;that is a quite different process from judicial review. We do not have time to debate that in detail today, but I simply say that there is wide consensus on the need to reform the coroner system. There are many good coroners and many excellent coroner&#8217;s offices, but it is a very uneven system. The chief coroner should now be a mechanism for undertaking that reform, but the issue of appeals is one on which there is much more to be argued over and we might be holding out to families the false promise that they will somehow be in a better position than they would be with the present system. It would be wrong of us in this House to do that, so I urge the Minister to get on with the crucial reforms of the system, which the chief coroner can achieve.</p>

	<p pid="a.891.0/1">I strongly endorse the views just expressed by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase>. I represent a coroner&#8217;s court in Southwark and we have had very good coroners&#8212;Monty Levine, who was very famous, and Andrew Harris, the current coroner, who is a friend of mine. However, like other colleagues, I have had experiences, involving constituents and others, of really bad coroner&#8217;s decisions. The Taylor family have been mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40583" name="Robert Flello">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent South (Robert Flello)</phrase>, and Michael, who died, was a constituent of mine. I am also talking about the inquests after the Marchioness sank in my constituency, the battle that the lovely late Eileen Dallaglio had to fight on behalf of her daughter and the battles that all the others like her had to fight. In the end, they had to go through a judicial review because they were terribly treated by the coroner who dealt with that case.</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/2">I welcome the fact that the Government have changed their mind and that the scheme introduced eventually by Labour&#8212;we had to push but it was eventually put on the statute book&#8212;can now be implemented in respect of creating a chief coroner. I urged, as others have, that that decision be taken. It is reasonable to proceed gradually along the road that has now been accepted by the Government. They are clear that they are going to report back on Army coroner&#8217;s inquests&#8212;the Armed Forces Bill does that. As Lord McNally said in the other place, this is not just about training; it is about monitoring, reporting and direction. That will give us a good base. There will also be an annual report to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/3">May I end by saying that I also have the privilege of being the Member of Parliament for the headquarters of the Royal British Legion, and I know that Inquest has worked with the RBL very well. They are very honourable organisations, they have fought an honourable</p>
	<p pid="a.891.0/4">fight and they have won an honourable victory. The House owes its gratitude to them and to the Government for understanding the strength of feeling on this case.</p>

	<p pid="a.892.0/1">With the leave of the House, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me just repeat that the Government are committed to urgent and meaningful reform of the coroner system to ensure that inquests are timely, efficient and effective and that bereaved families are provided with the information and support they need throughout this emotionally difficult process. I was pleased to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40309" name="Jon Trickett">the hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> speaking in favour of reform. He needs to be aware that the position on the statutory basis for reform was the same between all the parties in the House, despite differences over the position on the chief coroner. I was very pleased to hear my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> recognising that and making the point strongly.</p>
	<p pid="a.892.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40686" name="Jonathan Ashworth">The hon. Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)</phrase> made the very good point that as important as coronial reform is for military inquests, this goes much further than military inquests. I acknowledge his concern that faith groups should be considered and I take that back with me.</p>
	<p pid="a.892.0/3">Various hon. Members spoke about cost and the implications for judicial review. My hon. Friends the Members for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy) and for Dover (Charlie Elphicke) pointed out the need for closure for families and made their points very well. I understand the concerns about the cost of judicial review, but the chief coroner would not have had the final word on appeals. The option of judicially reviewing the chief coroner&#8217;s decision would still have been available, and bereaved families might have been encouraged to exhaust all mechanisms for challenging the coroner&#8217;s original findings. As a result, we would not have expected any reduction in the number of judicial reviews; indeed, there could have been an increase.</p>

	<p pid="a.897.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.897.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House takes note of and approves the National Policy Statement for Ports, which was laid before this House on <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-24">24 October</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.897.2/3">It falls to me to introduce the motion because the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40308" name="Michael Penning">the Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase>, the Minister with responsibility for shipping, is this evening hosting a reception on the occasion of the 27th assembly of the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.897.2/4">The national policy statement sets out national policy which must be considered in determining whether development consent should be granted to port infrastructure projects that are examined by the Infrastructure Planning Commission or, with effect from next April, when it is intended that the Infrastructure Planning Commission will be abolished, the major infrastructure planning unit in the Planning Inspectorate. It is also intended that the national policy statement will stand as a material consideration for port developments below the capacity thresholds that are set out in section 24 of the Planning Act 2008, which fall to be considered by the Marine Management Organisation. The national policy statement applies to ports in England and Wales, but not in Scotland or Northern Ireland, where ports policy is devolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.897.2/5">Members will know that the previous Administration consulted on a proposal for the national policy statement on ports between November 2009 and February 2010. Alongside and beyond this consultation, Parliament also undertook scrutiny of the draft national policy statement. Scrutiny in this House was undertaken by the Select Committee on Transport, which held three oral hearings, took written evidence and in March 2010 published a report of its findings with 22 recommendations and conclusions, to which the Government have responded. I would like to take this opportunity to thank members of the previous Transport Committee, including the then and present Chairman, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40370" name="Louise Ellman">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman)</phrase>, for the important work that they undertook, the thoroughness with which they approached it, and their readiness to do that within a relatively short period.</p>
	<p pid="a.897.2/6">This debate is taking place because the Government have agreed with the House to anticipate, as we did earlier this year for the suite of energy national policy statements, the relevant requirements of the Localism Act 2011, which will not come into effect until next year. I will speak briefly about the Government&#8217;s planning reform agenda; the purpose of national policy statements; and the background to the Government&#8217;s ports policy and the need for new infrastructure, which is central to the national policy statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.897.2/7">On the planning reform agenda, the Government are committed to making the planning system as a whole work better. &#8220;Better&#8221; means faster, fairer and easier to understand for all involved, including applicants and</p>
	<p pid="a.897.2/8">objectors, while of course giving due regard to environmental considerations. It most emphatically does not mean denying people a right to be heard. My ministerial colleagues at the Department for Communities and Local Government are satisfied that the system of engagement and consultation set up by the Planning Act 2008 fully secures that right, so we have not sought to modify that. Engagement with local people and their representatives from an early stage is crucial if applications are to come to the Infrastructure Planning Commission or Planning Inspectorate with the project as well defined as it can be, and with proposals for avoiding, mitigating and/or compensating for adverse impacts.</p>

	<p pid="a.898.0/1">Is the Minister aware that after a year-long planning inquiry, a proposal for a massive container port at Dibden bay on the edge of the New Forest was turned down? I understand that there would not be provision for any such inquiry in the future. Can he assure me and my constituents that a streamlined planning process for such a proposal would be no more likely to be carried than it was under the previous, rather more detailed opportunities for challenging it?</p>

	<p pid="a.898.1/1">I do not believe that the change in arrangements makes that more likely, but obviously every application is considered on its merits and according to the circumstances that apply at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.1/2">The Government have set demanding targets for the consideration of what could be complex cases, but applicants and their consultees must contribute by thinking well ahead and ensuring that applications are fit for purpose. The Department recommends that ports should start in this spirit by consulting on port master plans. These are neither statutory documents, nor part of the formal Planning Act regime, but nevertheless they could help enormously to promote local understanding of what a port is trying to achieve and how best to avoid or mitigate adverse impacts. Master plans are not confined to large ports. Newhaven in my constituency is an excellent example of a port engaging thoroughly with its community is that way.</p>

	<p pid="a.898.2/1">Paragraph 4.4.1 of the national policy statement states:</p>
	<p pid="a.898.2/2">&#8220;Ports in England and Wales operate on commercial lines, without public subsidy and with investment from their own operating profits or from the private sector investors.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.898.2/3">Will the Minister assure me that the Government will uphold that policy rigorously and fairly, particularly given the desire of the port of Liverpool to use a publicly funded cruise terminal to compete with the privately funded cruise terminals in Southampton, which breaches the principle of fair competition?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.898.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="898"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0003.htm#11112951003551">
	<p pid="a.898.3/1">I am sure that it is Government policy to uphold all policies fairly, and I imagine that that is what my hon. Friend the shipping Minister and others will seek to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.3/2">Where we have made a change is in the intention to abolish the Infrastructure Planning Commission so that, from next April, major project applications will revert to the Secretary of State for decision following consideration by the major infrastructure planning unit, which is to be set up within the Planning Inspectorate. That reinstates</p>
	<p pid="a.898.3/3">an important element of democratic oversight in the process, although I should make it clear that the Secretary of State intends to consider applications on the facts, on the advice of the major infrastructure planning unit, and in accordance with the national policy statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.3/4">Another aspect of the Planning Act that we have retained is the principle that applications should not succeed if their adverse impacts outweigh their benefits. I do not believe that many applications will fail that test if they are thoroughly prepared in accordance with the national policy statement, but none the less this represents a robust safety net in case we fail to foresee any significant adverse impacts. The Infrastructure Planning Commission, and the major infrastructure planning unit that will succeed it, will not be a completely one-stop shop, but it nevertheless reduces the separate applications potentially required. Marine licensing, as set up under the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, streamlines previous licence and consent requirements, and associated development can now be fully integrated with the main application.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.3/5">The purpose of national policy statements more generally is to provide a framework for preparing, considering and deciding planning applications. Therefore, this national policy statement does not purport to be a complete statement of Government policy as it relates to each and every aspect of ports. In essence, it is a planning document.</p>
	<p pid="a.898.3/6">The UK is of course a trading nation, and well over 90% of our international trade by weight arrives or leaves by sea&#8212;the lion&#8217;s share of a total traffic of around 500 million tonnes a year. Ports are under-appreciated. They ply much of their trade behind high security fences, and even large ships can be surprisingly inconspicuous to those living in the port&#8217;s hinterland. We need port capacity to carry that trade and provide for coastal traffic, which can help to take lorries off our roads and reduce the incidence of pollution and congestion.</p>

	<p pid="a.899.0/1">I very much welcome the national policy statement and those statements hat will have a positive impact on ports, such as Falmouth, set out in today&#8217;s national infrastructure plan. One helpful recommendation relates to the habitats directive and helping to balance the economic and social impacts of a port against potential impacts on habitats. It proposes setting up an industry body that would work with Ministers to review some of the over-zealous interpretations of the habitats directive and its impact on licensing port activities. Will the Minister shed some light on when that body will be set up and which industry bodies will be represented on it?</p>

	<p pid="a.899.1/1">I am afraid I cannot answer that question in detail, but I will ask my hon. Friend the shipping Minister to respond to it. We are determined to strike a balance between the sensible needs of a working port and respecting the natural environment as far as possible, and it would be quite wrong if one of those were able to triumph unduly over the other. We can strike a sensible balance in our arrangements, and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40616" name="Sarah Newton">the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)</phrase> is right to raise the matter, so I will ensure that the shipping Minister writes to her with the answer that she has asked for.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.900.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40563" speakername="John Denham" colnum="900"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0003.htm#11112951003554">
	<p pid="a.900.0/1">The Minister could unlock &#163;150 million of totally private investment in Southampton&#8217;s container port next September if only he and his colleague&#8217;s officials cut through the red tape holding up that investment and the dredging of the River Test, which is necessary for large container ships. I am sure that he will not have been briefed on the issue, but I urge him to take it away and see what can be done to resolve it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.900.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="900"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0003.htm#11112951003555">
	<p pid="a.900.1/1">I will happily take that issue away. It is important that we unlock private investment, that we help our ports and, at this particular time, as the Chancellor said today, bring forward investment where possible, so I will look at the problems that exist in the area and see whether they can be overcome. It may be that they cannot, but it is perfectly proper to raise the issue in the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.900.1/2">Ports are diverse. They cater for liquid-bulks, dry-bulks and break-bulks, ro-ro, including trade vehicles, and of course containers, and they play host to many kinds of warehousing, distribution and process activities. Their markets can be lively and volatile, and they need to be nimble in the short term to react to changing market conditions and patterns of demand, yet they must also plan for the long term. Port infrastructure is long-lived, lasting 20, perhaps 30, years and more, so it is important that such decisions are taken carefully, with full regard to all their significant consequences.</p>
	<p pid="a.900.1/3">In the short term, the ports industry is well placed to respond to economic recovery. The first phase of Hutchison&#8217;s Felixstowe South project is already open, and that will help to secure the nation&#8217;s ability to accommodate the largest container vessels; we have seen the announcement by Dubai Ports World that it plans to complete the first phase of the London Gateway container terminal by the end of 2013; ABP Southampton, to which the right hon. Gentleman perhaps alluded, is pressing ahead with its own expansion plans; and other ports, including Bristol, Teesport and Mersey, already have consent for development.</p>
	<p pid="a.900.1/4">We cannot afford to be complacent, however. Investors in ports need to be able to plan development for every type of traffic, and to do so in a planning context that is stable and well understood. Equally, ports&#8217; neighbours need to know how their essential interests will be protected through the planning system.</p>
	<p pid="a.900.1/5">The national policy statement brings together established policy for ports and established policy for mitigating their adverse impact. The fundamental policy that we set out in the ports national policy statement is market-led, building on the success of the industry since it was freed from the constraints of state ownership and the national dock labour scheme. Port operators are best placed to decide the type of facilities they need, so this is a non-location directive national policy statement, and I make no apology for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.900.1/6">At the same time, development must be in sympathy with the environment, including the marine environment &#8212;to pick up the point that my hon. Friend the Member for Truro and Falmouth made. The national policy statement sets out in some detail how that translates into requirements for planning applications and their accompanying environmental statements. Unless there is provision for sufficient capacity, disruption at major ports has the potential to translate very quickly into serious disruption to people&#8217;s everyday lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.900.1/7">The national policy statement expresses confidence that the ports industry, with each owner/operator taking its own commercial view, will deliver the resilience that the country needs against disruption, and the national policy statement is very clear that the planning system should give weight to delivering that important resilience.</p>
	<p pid="a.900.1/8">Finally, in completing the national policy statement, we have been fully conscious of the fact that ports are nodes in a network, and that connecting infrastructure is essential to their success.</p>

	<p pid="a.901.0/1">The Minister said that authority over, and responsibility for, ports is devolved to Northern Ireland, the area that I represent, so from a ports point of view, what is the relationship between Westminster and Northern Ireland? In other words, do we have continuity of strategy and parity so that the relationship between the mainland and Northern Ireland is real and we all benefit?</p>

	<p pid="a.901.1/1">I assure the hon. Gentleman that there are, indeed, well established and close links between the Department for Transport and the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We certainly draw attention to and discuss with the devolved Administrations any issue that appears to have importance outside the English coastline, as it were, so I hope that that reassurance satisfies him.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.1/2">Several consultees, as well as the Transport Committee, argued that the national policy statement on ports should be designated alongside the launch of our consultation on the proposal for a national networks national policy statement. I have some sympathy with those arguments, but so much of transport policy is interconnected that one could make a case for linking many other documents in this way, and the practicalities do not always work out. In the Government&#8217;s response to the Transport Committee&#8217;s recommendations, we explained why we are confident that both national policy statements will work as free-standing but mutually consistent statements.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.1/3">Our reforms to the major infrastructure planning process will ensure that there is a concise framework for development that can be readily understood by all those involved in the planning system. Ministers will be responsible for decisions to consent or to refuse major infrastructure development, thus closing the circle of democratic accountability. I look forward to listening to contributions and responding to issues raised during the debate. I commend the national policy statement on ports to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.901.2/1">This motion is brought before the House on the day that the Chancellor has unveiled his national infrastructure plan on which the UK&#8217;s economic recovery is supposed to rest. I have to say that those are grand hopes for a 150-page wish list with little coherence and even less sense of how it will be delivered. Although it is welcome that the House is getting the chance to debate the national policy statement on ports&#8212;an important innovation pioneered by the previous Government and made possible</p>
	<p pid="a.901.2/2">by the passage of the Planning Act 2008&#8212;it is time that Ministers faced up to the opportunities that are being missed because of failure to join up key decision making on transport infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.2/3">First, though, let me say what we support. We are pleased that national policy statements are going ahead and that Ministers have chosen to accept the Transport Committee&#8217;s recommendation that debates on them should take place in Government time.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.2/4">We have heard today, in the Chancellor&#8217;s autumn statement, that Britain faces continued stagnation. Unfortunately, it will take more than a national policy statement on ports, no matter how finely crafted, to return our flatlining economy to health. However, although not sufficient, thriving ports are necessary to any recovery. Any successful route out of these doldrums will require an economic rebalancing that includes Britain&#8217;s exporting more to the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.2/5">With about 90% of world trade taking place by sea, we need more than ever to ensure that Britain has sufficient modern, efficient port capacity that is capable of handling the size of ships and containers that are coming to dominate global trade. That port capacity needs to be linked to a land-based transport network that provides reliable and efficient links for exported and imported goods. That means having fast and free-flowing road links to major ports and increasing capacity on key rail routes, not only in relation to train paths but to enhancing the loading gauge to allow larger containers to be carried. That is why the last Labour Government worked with Network Rail to allow containers of 9 feet 6 inches to be carried between Southampton and the midlands. Today&#8217;s statement on rail freight interchanges is therefore welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.2/6">Our ports are essential to this island nation. They are part of our heritage and our future as a global trader. In 2010, the UK&#8217;s ports handled 512 million tonnes of freight, making our ports sector the largest of any in Europe. Ports and directly related services account for about 58,000 jobs, widely distributed across the country. From Immingham to Southampton and from the Medway to Liverpool, ports are at the centre of local economies.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.2/7">We support the principles behind the policy statement in that port expansion is essential economically but must be conducted in ways that benefit local economies, drive regeneration and are environmentally sensitive. That is because businesses seeking new markets will be looking to the new Administration to deliver on the significant expansions consented to by the previous Government: a two thirds increase in the handling capacity at Felixstowe, consented to in 2006; the London gateway port that the Minister mentioned, handling up to 3.5 million containers a year and consented to in 2007; a doubling of capacity at Liverpool, also consented to in 2007; and further major expansions given the green light at Bathside bay in Harwich, at Teesport, and at Bristol.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.2/8">Although we agree with the underlying principles of the statement and will therefore support its approval, the way in which it has been presented exposes serious shortcomings in the Government&#8217;s approach to planning transport infrastructure. I hope that the Government will reflect on that and make changes so that their already disjointed infrastructure planning does not deteriorate further.</p>
	<p pid="a.901.2/9">The need to link ports with other infrastructure projects, particularly in road and rail, is obvious. However, the Minister has not given a satisfactory explanation of why he has ignored the recommendation of the Transport Committee to integrate the NPS on ports with the promised NPS on national networks.</p>

	<p pid="a.903.0/1">The hon. Gentleman will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that the Eddington report was published in 2006 or 2007. The previous Government did not get on with improving road infrastructure to the ports. I say gently that it is a bit rich for him to criticise this Government for not moving more quickly on that.</p>

	<p pid="a.903.1/1">Progress was made, but unquestionably more needs to be done. I think that it was incumbent on the incoming Government to respond positively to the recommendations made by the Transport Committee just before the last election. It is a matter of great regret that they have not done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.903.1/2">The Government have chosen to abolish the Infrastructure Planning Commission, yet the entire statement is written on the basis that the IPC exists. I hope that the Minister will make it clear in winding up, if he has time, or in writing if necessary, whether the end date that he gave of April next year is a firm date or simply a target, and whether that change will require further consultation on the NPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.903.1/3">The House is being asked to approve the NPS without reference to wider ports policy, most notably on ownership models, including mutualisation. As the Minister is well aware, that is of great interest to many Members and local communities, most notably around Dover and the trust ports. The lack of any guidance on ownership and changes of status in the NPS demonstrates why it is not a substitute for a proper ports policy. I hope that the Minister, whom it is an unexpected pleasure to see today, or the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40308" name="Michael Penning">the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase>, will commit to coming before the House with a comprehensive statement on ports policy, in which the NPS sits.</p>
	<p pid="a.903.1/4">It is unfortunate that the statement gives such limited consideration to the economic and social impacts of port development proposals, particularly on local employment. After the fiasco of the Thameslink procurement process, Ministers claim to be alive to these issues, yet they seem to be little more than an afterthought in this document.</p>
	<p pid="a.903.1/5">The Transport Committee recommended that the statement should include preference for port development to reduce inland road transport, yet that is missing from the statement. It contains no wider policy on how to achieve a reduction in the reliance on road freight. We hope that Ministers will consider revising the NPS to ensure that development decisions are taken in a way that specifically promotes and encourages a modal shift for onward transportation away from roads and on to rail and coastal shipping.</p>
	<p pid="a.903.1/6">On climate change, there is little in the NPS on emissions. The Government need to make it clear whether they will accept the advice of the Committee on Climate Change to include the UK&#8217;s share of shipping emissions in the 2050 target.</p>
	<p pid="a.903.1/7">Finally, we support and welcome the growing demand from the offshore energy sector for additional port capacity, including in my constituency of Barrow and Furness. The Government need to take a more proactive role to ensure that the UK takes a larger slice of this booming market. That is referenced in the NPS, but there is little detail. Will the Minister say how the Government intend actively to promote the potential for ports in the offshore energy sector?</p>
	<p pid="a.903.1/8">The statement shows some progress but, with the economy flagging, the Government need to raise their game on ports and infrastructure across the piece.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.904.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" speakername="Charlie Elphicke" colnum="904"  time="018:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0004.htm#11112951003561">
	<p pid="a.904.0/1">The NPS is extraordinarily important. Representing Dover, I know just how important it is. Only today, the approval has been announced of a plan for the development of the western docks at Dover. It is a gold-plated plan on a rather larger scale than it needs to be, with a price tag of &#163;400 million of investment, and the application has taken getting on for five years to go through the system&#8212;an awfully long time. Although the planned capacity will possibly not be needed until 2025 or 2030, owing to the economic difficulties that the country has faced in recent years, and although a gold-plated scheme certainly is not needed, it is an important step forward for the development of the port of Dover. It is much easier to amend an application once permission has been granted than to make a new one.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.0/2">The fact that it has taken so long for the application finally to be approved underlines the need for a far swifter system of getting applications passed and sorted out. As the Transport Committee made clear in its report, there have been calls from business interests and others for major infrastructure projects to be handled properly, not with extensive public inquiries and long drawn-out decision-making processes but in a shorter and sharper way&#8212;something a bit less than the terminal 5 or Sizewell B inquiry nightmares. The NPS is therefore extraordinarily welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.0/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40415" name="Julian Lewis">the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis)</phrase> was right that the application at Dibden bay took a long time and got thrown out. It took four years, and I believe that it cost the applicant some &#163;45 million, so that was dead money. That makes no sense whatever. The new, swifter method will be much better.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.0/4">The shadow Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40058" name="John Woodcock">the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)</phrase>, rightly made the point that it is desirable to consider the wider aspects of the matter. My understanding is that the NPS is more focused on planning applications for ports than on whether development rights will be granted. I agree with him that, some years on from the Eddington report, which was produced back in 2006, not a lot has happened to the road infrastructure to ports. Although I picked him up for making a slightly partisan point about that, the fundamental point was accurate. We in Dover have been waiting for the upgrade of the A2, which is an important potential artery to the port. It was in the roads programme back in 1997, but was taken out and has not yet got back in. We have been waiting for that road to be dualled and upgraded for years, but it has not happened. We feel very strongly about that, and the Eddington report was fundamentally correct on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.904.0/5">I turn to the NPS itself. The contents page reveals a massive focus on the environmental side of things. There are sections on, for instance, the environmental impact assessment, habitats and species regulations, pollution control, climate change control, biodiversity&#8212;so the list goes on. There is, one suspects, a greater concern about flood risks, coastal change and all the environmental things&#8212;including, I dare say, the lesser-spotted shellfish&#8212;than on socio-economic impacts, tourism and, above all, regeneration.</p>

	<p pid="a.905.0/1">I totally agree with the point that my hon. Friend has just made, and I wish to highlight one example in my constituency. The port facilities have existed for more than 100 years, and they offer every opportunity for growth and more jobs. However, they sit close to sites of special scientific interest, which are impeding that development. They fact that those SSSIs have been sitting close to that port development for so long surely illustrates that nature is resilient enough to accept port expansion.</p>

	<p pid="a.905.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that fundamentally good point.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.1/2">We need to think harder about the people involved. We need to consider ownership models, as the shadow Minister said, but also regeneration, tourism, jobs and money. We need to think about strengthening and boosting our economy, and making the most of our ports, just as much as we think about the environmental side.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.905.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40370" speakername="Louise Ellman" colnum="905"  time="018:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0004.htm#11112951003564">
	<p pid="a.905.2/1">The Select Committee on Transport published its report on the national policy statement on ports when the last Government were in office. We reported in March 2010&#8212;indeed, it was the first national policy statement to be reported on. The cross-party Transport Committee is not influenced by which party is in power. We reported at the time of the previous Government and we registered several serious concerns, and concluded that, unless proper consideration was given to our recommendations, the national policy statement was not fit for purpose. We therefore made a very clear statement then.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/2">Considerable time has elapsed and several changes have been made. We are now looking at the revised national policy statement, so my comments will refer to some of our criticisms and also to some of the changes that have been made since we produced our report.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/3">The key change since that time is the decision to abolish the Infrastructure Planning Commission. It was decided that, following consideration by the infrastructure planning unit and the Planning Inspectorate, the Secretary of State would make the decisions. It was also decided to abolish regional economic strategies and regional planning strategies. Some of our criticisms were of the planning process and the lack of clarity. The changes bring more clarity to the system whereby decisions are made. The background against which the planning statement is being assessed is therefore now rather different.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/4">Time has resolved another major criticism that we made. We were extremely concerned that the policy statement was made before the Marine Management Organisation, which was to examine port development</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/5">below the threshold for the infrastructure commission, had actually been set up. The Marine Management Organisation has now been set up and consulted, so that major criticism and concern has been addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/6">We expressed several concerns about environmental issues, and the Government&#8217;s response states that our concerns have been considered in a different part of the statement&#8212;in the documents appended to it. We register the Government&#8217;s response. We still have some concerns, but we accept that the Government have pointed out another way of addressing them.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/7">We were very worried that the Government were not providing an update on ports&#8217; traffic forecasts, which are extremely important. There was some dissension about the forecasting of ports traffic that was proposed as a basis for the ports statement. The Government&#8217;s response has not been to accept the precise form in which we wanted those forecasts to be updated, but it states that they will provide</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/8">&#8220;new forecasts in the near future&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/9">In a spirit of reasonableness, we accept that that concern has been addressed. We will wait and see how those new forecasts are provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/10">Those major concerns have therefore been addressed, at least in part. The changes go some way towards dealing with some of the major concerns that we, as a Committee in the previous Parliament, had when we stated that we did not think that the statement was fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/11">It is very important that the ports policy statement is correct. As hon. Members have pointed out this evening, ports are extremely important: 90% of the UK&#8217;s trade by tonnage and 512 million tonnes of freight go through our ports, and ports traffic contributes &#163;17.9 billion to GDP, taken together with the employment that it generates. Indeed, the direct employment is at least 132,000 jobs, with many more indirect jobs. The ports sector is extremely important and that is why having the correct ports policy matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/12">I want to deal with some concerns to which we have not received a satisfactory response. I think it is important to register them. One is the absence of a definitive ports policy, other than to say that the Government&#8217;s policy on ports is market-led. The Committee in the last Parliament felt that that was not good enough, because ports are such an important part of a thriving economy. Little progress has been made since in defining a ports policy. In fact, the ports policy such as it is was defined in an interim policy set out in 2007, and the Government have now said that that interim policy, together with additional statements that have been made, is their definitive ports policy. I suppose that we could look at it that way, but it does not meet in full the point of concern that the Committee has raised, and I hope that we can see further progress on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/13">The Committee also raised the concern that the policy statement on ports seemed to concentrate almost wholly on container traffic. While that is the basis of the ports&#8217; trade, we are concerned that other developments, such as offshore wind, were not considered properly. I am still unclear where such additional developments feature in the Government&#8217;s statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/14">I reiterate the concern that the Committee raised about the absence of national policy statements on national networks at the time that the ports policy</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/15">statement was put forward. I accept that some progress is being made. We are now being told that the national network statements will be laid in January. That is progress, but it would have been better if it had been done before we approve the ports policy statement. At least we have had some assurances that those statements are coming.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/16">It is important that we know the Government&#8217;s plans for other transport networks apart from ports, partly because of the economic importance of ports, but also because their impact on the economy, including the regional economies, is affected a great deal by how goods are transported to and from those ports. It is therefore necessary to look at road, rail and inland networks, and at the issue of multi-modal transport, and how that can be encouraged. It is important that we know how that will be addressed, and I hope that the Minister can give us some more information on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.905.2/17">We heard evidence during our inquiry from the northern ports that they felt that southern ports were very much at an advantage because of the extensive public investment in road and rail networks around them. The Committee in the previous Parliament felt that that was a very important issue, and this Parliament's Committee is of the same view. I noted the comments made by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40563" name="John Denham">the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr Denham)</phrase> this evening about the application from Liverpool for a turnaround cruise facility at the port. The application has been made because the possibility of such a facility, and the return of the cruise ships to Liverpool, is so very important to the regeneration of the city. I hope that when a decision is made on this issue&#8212;and there has had to be a consultation, as is proper&#8212;a reasoned approach will be taken, and recognition given to the fact that Southampton currently has 65% of the market for the turnaround facility, while Liverpool has only 5%.</p>

	<p pid="a.907.0/1">The hon. Lady of course has a constituency interest in this matter, and I represent a constituency close to Southampton. Does she appreciate that what is really worrying is that Liverpool received a great deal of both European and public money in order to build its port of call facility, and it gave undertakings that it would not use that facility as a turnaround point to start and end cruises? It now appears that it never had any intention of sticking to those undertakings, so if it were&#8212;bizarrely&#8212;to achieve retrospective permission to do what it promised not to do, surely it should have to pay back all the money and not just a quarter of it over a very long period, as is proposed.</p>

	<p pid="a.907.1/1">As a constituency MP I recognise the supreme importance of the turnaround facility to Liverpool. However, I also recognise that a reasoned judgment has to be made on the proper way in which to go ahead. The statements that the hon. Gentleman made about Liverpool&#8217;s intentions are not accurate, but this is not the place in which to pursue the detail of that. I hope that a reasonable decision is made. Liverpool City council has made an offer to deal with the very point that the hon. Gentleman has made, but that is for somebody else in another place to address. I simply ask for reason to be applied to resolve the issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.907.2/1">I do not want to intrude on the private grief between Southampton and Liverpool. I</p>
	<p pid="a.907.2/2">represent Dover, which has a little less cruise business. It is also further way and can take a more dispassionate position. Does the hon. Lady not recognise that there is something of a state aid issue here and that that needs to be handled with extreme care?</p>

	<p pid="a.908.0/1">The state aid issue is a matter that will have to be dealt with by the appropriate authorities. After discussing it with all the relevant parties, I hope that a reasoned judgment can be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.908.0/2">Earlier today, when the Chancellor delivered his autumn statement, he referred to the regional economic significance of ports and made reference to the support that he intended to give to developments in the Mersey and the Manchester ship canal in relation to Peel Holdings. It is because ports have such an important economic effect on a region that the issues that I raise are so significant and I hope that the Government are able to consider them.</p>
	<p pid="a.908.0/3">In light of the time that has elapsed since the report was compiled by the Committee under the previous Government and the changes and statements that have been made, I believe that the port statement should not be opposed. None the less, I want to hear from the Minister about how he will address some of the outstanding issues that I have raised tonight.</p>

	<p pid="a.908.1/1">It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. We have heard from speakers in whose constituencies are some of the great ports, such as Newhaven, Barrow-in-Furness, Dover and Liverpool. The port of Cambridge, however, is less active than it used to be. It was one of the country&#8217;s significant ports, dealing mainly with the Dutch trade, until the Fens were drained. If we do not get our climate change policy right, Cambridge may once again become an important port.</p>
	<p pid="a.908.1/2">I will try to be brief as there is little time left. I will not highlight why ports are so important to this country; I assume that that is obvious. Although the ports are very important for leisure and tourism, there are other factors involved. Goods that come into that port then have to move on. Currently far too much freight is moved by road, and road congestion is very damaging. In 2006, Transport for London estimated that road congestion in and around London cost &#163;1.6 billion a year, and that figure will go up. More locally for me, the A14 in my constituency is used by a large number of heavy goods vehicles, which are largely travelling from the very successful port in Felixstowe. Those vehicles cause a large number of accidents and most of the congestion, which is why I welcome the &#163;20 million that will be spent on trying to alleviate the problem and ensure that we do not have those accidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.908.1/3">The key solution is to do more with rail freight and I should like to hear what the Government are planning to do in that regard. Rail freight over the past decade has grown by two thirds and saved 2 million tonnes of pollutants and 31.5 million lorry journeys. There is still more to do. The Felixstowe east-west rail freight link could be boosted. There is some work happening now, but more needs to be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.908.1/4">I also wish to highlight the role that canal freight plays. Canals are much more efficient in terms of CO2</p>
	<p pid="a.908.1/5">than roads. Tesco has been using barges since 2007. In addition to rail freight or canal freight, will the Minister also consider the idea of inland ports so that we can minimise the amount of road travel? That is one of the key aspects that I should like to hear more about in his statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.909.0/1">I understand that, for reasons that are slightly beyond my ken, people seem to be very anxious to finish at 7 o&#8217;clock this evening rather than at the normal time of 10 o&#8217;clock. I suppose that that is something to do with the fact that we are beginning to sit rather earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.909.0/2">The issue of Dibden bay, which I referred to in an intervention, is the single most important constituency issue in New Forest East in the 14 years that I have represented it. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" name="Charlie Elphicke">the Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase> said, it was a long time before the considerations on whether a giant container port should be built at Dibden bay produced decisive outcomes. We had a year-long public inquiry, as I said in an intervention, but we also had, as he said, several years leading up to that public inquiry. If the new procedure, first through the Infrastructure Planning Commission put forward by the previous Government and then under the replacement arrangements proposed by this Government, allowed for public consultation&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.910.2/1">It is an honour to have secured this Adjournment debate on empty homes. It is an issue that I and many Members on both sides of the Chamber have raised in recent weeks and months. Indeed, only last week, three Members asked about empty homes during the ministerial statement on housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.2/2">I shall digress for one second. This debate may be my last in the House with my Movember moustache, which is coming off on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-01">1 December</phrase>. Like many Movember men across the country, I have sprouted some hair on my top lip&#8212;you can just see it, Mr Deputy Speaker&#8212;to raise awareness of the Prostate Cancer Charity and men&#8217;s health issues. All Members would agree that with the tragic events over the weekend we need to be more open about men&#8217;s health, particularly issues such as depression.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.2/3">I became involved in the issue of empty homes because of my deep concern about overdevelopment in my Colne Valley constituency in west Yorkshire. It is home to the lovely towns of Slaithwaite, Marsden, Holmfirth, Honley, the Huddersfield suburbs of Lindley and Birchencliffe and many more beautiful areas. I was concerned that our beautiful Pennine countryside was set to be dug up for new identikit homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.2/4">The idea of green fields being developed is bad enough, but it defies all logic to be doing it while thousands of existing empty properties are being left to rot. In fact, my local council, Kirklees, has just voted for a local development framework that will impose 22,470 new homes in the district over the next 15 years, with some going on green belt. I say, bring Britain&#8217;s empty homes back into use first.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.2/5">There is a groundswell of support for the empty homes campaign. I have to admit that I am a big fan of Channel 4 shows such as &#8220;Grand Designs&#8221; and &#8220;Restoration Man&#8221;. The presenter of the latter show, George Clarke, will be telling the nation about the scandal of Britain&#8217;s empty homes in a forthcoming series on Channel 4 next Monday and Tuesday evening&#8212;that is the plug out of the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.2/6">The Government have responded really well to this problem, with targeted initiatives and cash to back it up. The inspirational&#8212;I do not use that term loosely, as he is a master of his brief and has seen off eight Opposition Housing Ministers&#8212;Minister for Housing and Local Government has spoken with me at great length on the issue, as has the Minister here this evening, who I know will give more details of Government help later.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.2/7">What is an empty home? Homes are left empty for a number of reasons&#8212;for example, when they are between tenants, being refurbished, in probate or when the owner is in care or hospital. For the purposes of this campaign and this debate, however, we are primarily talking about long-term empty homes. These are properties that are stuck empty, and I believe that getting those houses back into use could be a quick and relatively inexpensive way of providing more housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.2/8">How many empty homes are there? Across the UK as a whole, there are close to 1 million empty homes and approximately 350,000 long-term empty homes&#8212;this at a time when 2 million families are on housing waiting lists. Those figures are based on statistics from the Governments in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, plus advice from the Empty Homes Agency about the number of empty properties across the UK that are not currently accounted for in official figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.2/9">In my patch, we have been trying to get accurate figures from Kirklees council&#8212;I need to put the record straight on this. Following the original freedom of information request on the issue, we were told that there were 6,864 short-term empty properties&#8212;properties with a council tax exemption&#8212;and 3,463 long-term empty homes, or properties no longer exempt from council tax. By adding 1,000-plus second homes or holiday homes, the total comes to over 11,000. Obviously not all those homes are available for bringing back into use, and nobody has ever suggested that.</p>
	<p pid="a.910.2/10">Kirklees council has now revised the figures, giving me&#8212;and everybody else who has been asking&#8212;another figure on long-term empty homes. However, whether it is 11,000, 7,000 or 3,463, it is one too many when people are waiting for homes and when the developers are eyeing up our greenfield sites. The Government have stepped up to the challenge, making &#163;150 million available in the housing strategy, which will be delivered quickly. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will have more details on the scheme, which he and his colleagues have been working on.</p>

	<p pid="a.911.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate about such an important issue, which is crucial to my constituency, where there are some 2,600 to 2,700 empty properties. Would he be shocked, as I was, to discover that local authorities cannot bid for the empty homes fund?</p>

	<p pid="a.911.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that contribution. Those are some of the issues that I hope the Minister will say something about later. Councils, community groups and all sorts of community people need opportunities to tap into those funds, and those are some of the points that I will be making later.</p>
	<p pid="a.911.1/2">I acknowledge that, through the new homes bonus, 16,000 empty homes have been brought back into proper use in just one year. That shows what can be done. However, the Housing Minister has admitted that it is a scandal that 700,000 or 750,000 properties are empty when so many people are in desperate housing need. The Government announced last week that they were adding another &#163;50 million to the existing &#163;100 million fund for empty homes, making a total of &#163;150 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.911.1/3">Let me set out some of the benefits of bringing empty homes back into use. The refurbishment and reoccupation of those homes could clearly contribute significantly to meeting England&#8217;s housing needs. The reuse of empty homes can also help to protect the beauty and openness of England&#8217;s natural landscapes for future generations, by negating the need for development on greenfield sites, which is important in my area of west Yorkshire. The renewal of existing communities can take advantage of existing infrastructure such as transport links and schools. Refurbishment constitutes a much more efficient</p>
	<p pid="a.911.1/4">use of construction materials than new build, and the reinvigoration of existing communities can add to the local economy.</p>

	<p pid="a.912.0/1">As always, my hon. Friend is making a strong and persuasive case on behalf of his constituents. Does he agree that, as well as there being many empty homes, changing shopping patterns have resulted in many empty shops? Many are substantial buildings that could be refurbished at a reasonable cost and brought back into use as homes.</p>

	<p pid="a.912.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a really good point. Empty shops are an issue in my part of the world, as they are in his. Indeed, there are concerns that there are slightly too many charity shops, for example. I have also been thinking about how the flats and apartments above shops could be brought back into use. That would mean families and young couples living in our town centres, which would not become no-go zones in the evening. That would help, so I thank him for making that valuable point.</p>

	<p pid="a.912.2/1">Is the hon. Gentleman aware of Northern Ireland&#8217;s &#8220;Living over the shop&#8221; scheme? We have used it over the past couple of years to provide accommodation above shops, enabling young people to live in town centres, so perhaps there should be discussions with the Northern Ireland Assembly, in order to enlighten the Minister about the possibilities.</p>

	<p pid="a.912.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that useful intervention. I hope that the Minister will take it on board. I am willing to learn best practice from all over the United Kingdom. The scheme described by the hon. Gentleman sounds exciting, and if it has worked in Northern Ireland, I hope that we too can take advantage of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.912.3/2">I am particularly excited about the opportunities to reinvigorate certain trades and specialisms using local materials. Good-quality insulation and other energy-efficient measures should also be key to the renewal of empty homes. There are plenty of plus points. In my area, I should like educational establishments such as Kirklees college to become involved. Perhaps students could use empty homes for hands-on projects. I note that Kirklees college runs a course called &#8220;Construction and building crafts&#8221;. What better way for students to employ their skills than to return homes to use so that families can live in them?</p>
	<p pid="a.912.3/3">As I have said, the Government have already acted. The reoccupation of empty homes has been included in the scope of the new homes bonus, and 16,000 homes have been returned to use. However, I should like councils to be given more incentives to bring about reoccupation of empty homes. I should also like to see the use of brownfield sites. That really would be a sustainable housing policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.912.3/4">I am pleased that communities and local voluntary organisations will be able to tap into the funding so that it does not go only to councils, but I should like to hear more about the Government&#8217;s plans to allow councils, if they wish, to introduce an empty homes council tax premium on homes that have been empty for more than two years. That could serve as an incentive to the returning of homes to productive use.</p>

	<p pid="a.913.0/1">I am very interested in what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but might not the premium actually prove to be a disincentive? Some people might go off the radar, their properties might be registered as occupied, and they might therefore pay a 100% rather than a 125% rate of council tax.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-29a.913.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40181" speakername="Jason McCartney" colnum="913"  time="019:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111129/debtext/111129-0004.htm#11112963000070">
	<p pid="a.913.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has made a good point. Councils might wish to consider introducing such schemes themselves, given that they have the local knowledge. Perhaps they should introduce it on a trial basis. It might work better in some areas than in others. I am pleased that the Government are considering different options, and that they are happy to devolve power to councils so that the various needs of communities can be dealt with on a more local basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.1/2">Some key changes need to be made to the draft national policy planning framework. Instead of the presumption clause in favour of sustainable development, let us consider a presumption clause in favour of returning empty homes to use and ensuring that brownfield land is developed before greenfield land.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.1/3">Given that commercial banks rarely lend money on empty homes, the Minister might wish to consider a sustainable low-cost loan fund. It could be kick-started with cash from the empty homes fund and managed by a commercial bank in partnership with an appropriate body such as the Empty Homes Agency. The loan fund would help private empty home owners who needed money to return their properties to use. They could borrow modest sums from the fund, and repay the loans from subsequent rental income set at affordable levels. Would-be buyers on low incomes could also purchase empty homes cheaply and return them to use with the help of modest loans from the fund. Cash for the fund could also come from the proposed empty homes premium, which could impose a 150% council tax rate on properties that had been empty for over two years. I should like the Minister and his team to consider all those ideas, and then report to the House on their conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.1/4">Let me suggest a right to help local people to rescue abandoned properties. Will the Minister consider an amendment to current legislation on the community right to reclaim land? Should local people be able to use a new &#8220;community right to reclaim abandoned property&#8221; clause, which would enable them to apply to a tribunal to bring long-term abandoned properties in their areas back into use?</p>
	<p pid="a.913.1/5">Therefore, lots of action has already been taken. I hope that I have given lots of ideas for more, and I shall now sum up to allow colleagues to make a brief contribution. Let us put renewal and regeneration ahead of greenfield development. Let us use existing buildings and infrastructure as efficiently as possible, with the economic, environmental and social benefits for all. Let us finally get Britain&#8217;s empty homes back into use.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40181" name="Jason McCartney">the Member for Colne Valley (Jason McCartney)</phrase> on making a powerful speech containing lots of good ideas. The situation that he described in his constituency is identical to the one faced in mine. I welcome the measures in the Localism Bill providing for neighbourhood planning, and I am</p>
	<p pid="a.913.2/2">chairing the steering group of the Truro and Kenwyn parish neighbourhood plan. We face the same challenges that he portrayed so well. Through the development of our neighbourhood plan, we have identified a great number of empty properties in our villages and the city centre of Truro, as well as other buildings that we believe can commercially and viably be brought back into use to create much-needed homes for local people. However, in constructing our plan, we are aware that it will have to be inspected by the inspectorate, and the types of properties that my hon. Friend described being brought back into use will be considered by the inspectors as &#8220;windfall&#8221; properties and therefore cannot be counted as contributing towards the housing targets that we are developing to meet local need.</p>
	<p pid="a.913.2/3">I would very much like the Minister to consider that point, and when the Government are considering the national policy planning framework I would like them to examine the fact that these windfall properties need to be judged on their merits. I hope that if a good neighbourhood plan&#8212;such as, I am sure, ours will be when it is introduced&#8212;can demonstrate viable sites for bringing empty buildings back into use, they will not be deemed to be &#8220;windfall&#8221; properties but can be taken into consideration for our housing targets.</p>

	<p pid="a.914.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40181" name="Jason McCartney">the Member for Colne Valley (Jason McCartney)</phrase> for bringing to the House&#8217;s attention this important subject, which is very close to my heart, as I know it is to his. I was delighted that this move to bring empty homes back into use was written into the coalition agreement between our two parties and that we have now had the opportunity to put some real cash into the programme to deal with it. I also congratulate him on his moustache and wish him well with his fundraising.</p>
	<p pid="a.914.0/2">Like my hon. Friend, I have been in contact with George Clarke and Channel 4, and I am happy to add a second endorsement of the programme on empty homes that they are developing. He, I and they are appalled at the scandal that 250,000 properties are empty when millions of people are on waiting lists, anxiously looking for homes and unable to find them. As well as being eyesores and as well as easily falling into disrepair, empty homes are often an expensive menace to communities and public services, attracting antisocial behaviour, squatting and vandalism.</p>
	<p pid="a.914.0/3">The Government know very well that we need to build more homes, more quickly, and the housing strategy statement made in the House by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government last Monday shows real earnest intent. At the same time, we have to make better use of our existing homes, as that is better for communities, for the environment and for the families who have the new home to live in. We have been working on ways to bring empty homes back into use, and tackling those homes is one of the key pledges that we made in the housing strategy.</p>
	<p pid="a.914.0/4">My hon. Friend appeared to have some difficulty in understanding the situation in his constituency. The figures available to the Department refer to the whole local authority area of Kirklees. He might be interested</p>
	<p pid="a.914.0/5">to know that in the six years from 2004 to 2010, the number of empty homes reported to the Department went up from 6,200 to 7,300, so there were extra empty homes at a time when housing demand was rising. However, the good news for him is that Kirklees council will receive &#163;7.6 million under the new homes bonus over the next six years because it has succeeded in bringing 307 homes back into productive occupation.</p>
	<p pid="a.914.0/6">The Government have taken a number of important steps, including the new homes bonus, in response to the empty homes problem. Back in September, I announced that we were allocating a &#163;100 million budget so that housing associations, councils and community and voluntary groups could apply to bring empty homes back into use as affordable housing. I was astonished by the intervention of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40327" name="Graham Jones">the hon. Member for Hyndburn (Graham Jones)</phrase>, who said that councils are not eligible to apply for that money. That absolutely is not the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.915.0/1">That information was provided to me by a cabinet member of our local council, which had looked through the consultation. I was advised that it was not entitled to bid under the proposals. If I am wrong, I will stand corrected.</p>

	<p pid="a.915.1/1">Then the hon. Gentleman stands corrected.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.1/2">We recognise that there is a wide range of possible approaches to tackling empty homes and that different approaches are needed in different circumstances. Sometimes the right vehicle for doing that will be the council, but sometimes it will be other registered housing providers, housing associations or local community groups. The bidding guidance was published on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-21">21 November</phrase> and registered providers of social housing have until <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-23">23 January 2012</phrase> to submit applications.

	<p pid="a.915.3/1">No, I think not.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/2">Alongside the publication of the guidance on the bidding system for the &#163;100 million, we have also allocated almost &#163;3 million of empty homes funding for this financial year to organisations that are ready and able to deliver now, so that work can begin straight away. As a result of that spending, 200 properties will be brought back into use.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/3">We are also setting up a national intermediary in the next few weeks to administer the community element of the funding. There are legal reasons why it is not possible for that to be directed through the Homes and Communities Agency. It will allow smaller not-for-profit community and voluntary organisations to access some of the &#163;100 million and will allow community groups to stimulate new and innovative ways of tackling empty homes. I have seen plenty of those already, so I know that there are organisations ready to go. My hon. Friend mentioned the possibility of a rolling loan fund. There are some complexities with that which do not appear immediately, but some of the models through that community route might well exploit that opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/4">Funding will be allocated on a demand-led basis. To put it another way, we are not going to stuff people&#8217;s mouths or stuff organisations with money. We want the money to go to real schemes that will really deliver results. Let me add in parenthesis that the outgoing Government were great at allocating budgets to projects that could never be delivered, but we do not want to go down that route. Let us make it so that every pound counts towards bringing an empty home back into use.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/5">On top of the &#163;100 million with the launch of the housing strategy last week, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government was able to announce an additional &#163;50 million of funding to tackle some of the worst concentrations of empty homes. Although I do not know the detailed circumstances of my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency, I could well believe that some of the higher concentrations would be found in Kirklees and the measure might therefore apply to Colne Valley. I am sure he will want to explore that. A more intensive approach will be required than simply dealing with a home here and there, and it will involve refurbishing and reconfiguring homes, as well as improving housing in the public realm and tackling wider issues in the local area.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/6">The funding details of that &#163;50 million are being finalised and further details will be announced shortly, but there will be some differences between that fund and the &#163;100 million fund. The &#163;50 million fund will tackle concentrations of empty homes, and it will not be appropriate for all homes to be brought back into use as affordable housing, which is the clear intention of the &#163;100 million fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/7">My hon. Friend rightly praised the Government&#8217;s initiative of the idea of introducing a council tax premium, which is being consulted on. I hope that local authorities and others who are interested will respond positively to that proposal. He made a good point about the premium needing to be tailored to local circumstances. Councils will have local discretion to introduce a council tax premium on homes in their areas that have been empty for more than two years, to provide a stronger incentive for empty-home owners to bring them back into use. Of course, that could still be coupled with a discount or a free period at the onset of the home being empty. It will be important for local councils to configure their profile of charging accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.915.3/8">I have already commented on the new homes bonus. In the first year of such funding being given to councils, &#163;19 million can be attributed to empty homes coming back into use. As I have said, there are 307 such homes in Kirklees, which has got further to go than nearby Bradford, which brought 1,500 homes back into use with an equivalent budget coming back to the council. Again, my hon. Friend might want to speak politely&#8212;challenge, possibly&#8212;his council and ask, &#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with Kirklees compared with Bradford? Let&#8217;s get those empty homes back into use.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.916.1/2">In addition to those measures and separately, my right hon. Friend has announced housing market renewal transition funding of &#163;71 million to help families trapped in half-empty and abandoned streets as a consequence</p>

That will be a match-funding scheme, generating about &#163;71 million overall, as I said, to resolve the worst problems in the five most challenged areas: Merseyside, east Lancashire, north Staffordshire, Hull and Teesside.</p>
	<p pid="a.916.1/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40176" name="Martin Vickers">the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)</phrase> spoke about the conversion of shops into houses. Certainly, the Government are very much aware of those opportunities, and we are consulting on some</p>
	<p pid="a.916.1/6">changes of planning use classes that might make conversion to housing a simpler proposition in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.916.1/7">It only remains for me to comment on the right to rescue that my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley suggested might be useful. It will be difficult to combine that with the action that we are taking to prevent squatting, on which I am sure he is equally keen to see action.</p>
	<p pid="a.916.1/8">Empty homes are a vital resource for the housing market. We need to get more of them back into use sooner, and I look forward to working with hon. Members and friends all around the House in doing so in the next few years.</p>
	<p pid="a.916.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.916.1/10" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
