	<p pid="b.277.5/1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have regular discussions with ministerial colleagues and the Welsh Government on a range of issues, including the effects of fuel prices in Wales. The Government are addressing the rising cost of fuel through the abolition of the fuel tax escalator, the introduction of the fair fuel stabiliser and a cut in fuel duty announced at the Budget earlier this year.</p>

	<p pid="b.277.6/1">I thank the Minister for that response. Will he impress upon the Secretary of State the need to push the Government to introduce a true fuel duty stabiliser that would trigger an annual reduction in the pump price, as the so-called fair fuel stabiliser announced in the March Budget does not go anywhere near far enough? The volatility in petrol prices means businesses cannot budget, as noted yesterday by the Federation of Small Businesses in its submission for the autumn statement.</p>

	<p pid="b.277.7/1">I hear what the right hon. Gentleman says, but I must point out to him that the tax measures we have taken have resulted in petrol prices being approximately 6p per litre lower than they would have been had that escalator not been scrapped. Even taking VAT into account, fuel prices are approximately 3p per litre lower than they would have been.</p>

There are hardly any charging points all in Wales. There is not even one per constituency. What is being done to encourage that?</p>

	<p pid="b.277.9/1">As the right hon. Gentleman suggests, this is the technology of the future. As he knows, provision is being rolled out in the urban areas, and I hope solutions will be found to ensure that rural users will also be able to have access to suitable charging points.</p>

	<p pid="b.278.0/1">Does the Minister agree that although it would be highly desirable to reduce fuel costs, it is impossible to do so while we are running a deficit of &#163;160 billion a year as a result of the past actions of Opposition Members?</p>

	<p pid="b.280.4/1">That is two Ministers now who have used the word &#8220;disappointing&#8221; about unemployment. Frankly, it is a tragedy and one of the worst things about it is that a previous Conservative Government consigned constituencies such as mine and whole communities like the Rhondda to long-term mass unemployment. They are doing exactly the same now to a generation of young people. Will the Minister suggest one single thing that he personally is doing in his Department to tackle youth unemployment in Wales and in the Rhondda?</p>

We recognise the importance of the problem and that is why we have introduced the Work programme, which provides properly targeted support to young jobseekers.</p>

	<p pid="b.284.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for that answer. The Select Committee on Welsh Affairs recently heard from the chief executive of UKTI, but he, like our Committee, is still waiting in hope for his first meeting with the Welsh Minister for Business, Enterprise, Technology and Science. Given that surprising fact, and the fact that the Secretary of State herself has met the Committee and UKTI many times, what advice can she give the Welsh Business Minister on pushing the respect agenda and the interests of Welsh business?</p>

I continue to hold a series of meetings to see how we can assist and work with the Welsh Government to improve those figures.</p>

Brace&#8217;s bakery, an indigenous Welsh firm with its headquarters in Crumlin, took over an inward investment company in my constituency that was about to close down. On Monday, Brace&#8217;s increased its work force by a third, so will the Secretary of State give her congratulations and support to indigenous Welsh companies, and ensure that the rest of the country enjoys the great merits of Brace&#8217;s breads and Welsh cakes?</p>

	<p pid="b.284.3/1">Now the hon. Gentleman is tempting me; I always like a good Welsh cake. He should know how much I encourage indigenous Welsh companies, not least by my continuous support of the Fast Growth 50, which celebrates indigenous companies and the way they grow the economy, but he must not do down inward investment. In 2010-2011, 38 inward investment projects led to the creation of 2,444 new jobs and safeguarded another 1,100 jobs in Wales. I think that is pretty important and certainly not second best.</p>

We send our deepest sympathies to his wife, Ann, who is a friend to many here, and to his family and all his constituents. He will be missed by Members on both sides of the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.287.5/1">I join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to our brave soldiers who this week gave their lives in service to our country. All our thoughts should go out to them and their families at this very difficult time. Similarly, I join the tribute paid to the late hon. Member for Feltham and Heston.</p>
	<p pid="b.287.5/2">The mass strike proposed by the unions for this time next week will cause great upheaval for many of my constituents in High Peak.

	<p pid="b.287.6/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point. It really is irresponsible, when negotiations are ongoing, to cause strikes that will lead to the closure of most of the classrooms in our country. It is the height of irresponsibility. What is on offer is an extremely reasonable deal: low and middle-income earners getting a larger pension at retirement than they do now; all existing accrued rights being fully protected; and any worker within 10 years of retirement seeing no change in either the age they can retire or the amount they can receive. It is also a tragedy that it is not just the union leaders who do not understand this; the Labour party refuses to condemn these strikes.</p>

He was somebody who believed in young people, in opportunities for young people and, most of all, in the power of sport to change people&#8217;s lives&#8212;and, as I heard at his funeral yesterday, he certainly had an unusual idea for his first date. He took his future wife, Ann, to the Orient, which turned out not to be a Chinese restaurant but to be Leyton Orient, who were playing that day. He was a great and lovely man, and he will be missed by all of us, but most of all by Ann and by his family.</p>

	<p pid="b.288.0/1">Youth unemployment is up since the last election, I accept that; and youth unemployment is unacceptably high in this country, as it is unacceptably high right across Europe. The problem is that youth unemployment in this country has been rising since 2004, and under the previous Labour Government it went up by 40%.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.0/2">What we have to do to help young people back to work is to improve our school system so that they have proper qualifications; improve our welfare system so that it pays to work; and improve our employment system so that there are proper apprenticeships to help young people. We have 360,000 apprenticeships this year, helping young people to get work.</p>

Given that he did not answer the question, let me tell the House the reality: since he scrapped the future jobs fund in March, long-term youth unemployment has risen by 77%. Now, can he tell us what has happened to long-term youth unemployment since he introduced his Work programme in June?</p>

	<p pid="b.288.2/1">First, let me just repeat: youth unemployment went up by 40% under a Labour Government. Let me also remind the right hon. Gentleman of something that his brother, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40552" name="David Miliband">the right hon. Member for South Shields (David Miliband)</phrase>, said last week. He said very clearly that this Government did not</p>
	<p pid="b.288.2/2">&#8220;invent the problem of youth unemployment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.2/3">We should have that sort of candour from this brother.</p>
	<p pid="b.288.2/4">The Leader of the Opposition asked me very specifically about the future jobs fund and the Work programme. Let me give him the answer. The Work programme is helping 50% more people than the future jobs fund: it will help 120,000 young people this year, where the future jobs fund helped only 80,000. The waiting time for the most needy young people will be half the waiting time under the future jobs fund; under the Work</p>
	<p pid="b.288.2/5">programme, those who are not in education, employment or training will get help&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.288.2/9">I would have thought that Opposition Members would want to hear about what we are doing to help young people. They will get help within three months, rather than six, but the absolute key is that, because we are paying by results, the Work programme will actually help those who need the most help, whereas the future jobs fund put a lot of graduates into public sector jobs and was five times more expensive than the alternative. That is why we have scrapped it and replaced it with something better.</p>

If he is serious about tackling youth unemployment, he should get those on the highest incomes to help those with no income at all.

	<p pid="b.289.1/2">We have just heard a new use for the bonus tax&#8212;there have been nine already. Let me give the right hon. Gentleman the list. He has used his bonus tax for higher tax credits; giving child benefit to those on the highest rates of tax; cutting the deficit; spending on public services; more money for the regional growth fund&#8212;that is when he is defending it rather than attacking it; turning empty shops into cultural community centres; and higher capital spending.

	<p pid="b.290.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman accuses us of cutting taxes. Let me tell him what we are cutting. We are cutting interest rates, which is giving the economy the best boost. We are cutting corporation tax, and we now have the lowest rates of corporation tax in the G7. We are cutting tax for the low-paid, because we have taken 1 million people out of income tax. We are freezing the council tax, cutting the petrol tax and scrapping Labour&#8217;s jobs tax. That is what this Government are doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.290.0/2">Let me answer the right hon. Gentleman directly on the issues of growth and debt, because this is absolutely key. <i>[Interruption.] </i>The shadow Chancellor is at it again, I am afraid. All over Europe there is an interest rate storm, with high interest rates in Spain, Italy and even some of the countries at the heart of the eurozone. We must ensure that we keep this country safe with low interest rates. Let me just remind the Leader of the Opposition of this: if interest rates went up by 1% in this country, that would add &#163;1,000 to the typical family mortgage. That is the risk that we would have with Labour&#8217;s plans for more spending, more borrowing and more debt.</p>

Britain grew at 0.5% in the last quarter, which is the same as the US and Germany, faster than France, faster than Spain, faster than the EU average and faster than the eurozone average. That is the fact. Of course it is a difficult economic environment that we are in, but is there a single other mainstream party anywhere in Europe that thinks the answer to the debt problem is more spending and more borrowing? If he is worried about the level of debt, why is he proposing to add another &#163;100 billion to it?

This is a difficult economic environment, but the changes we are making to public sector pensions, for instance, mean that low-paid people in the public sector will actually get a better pension, including many women.

	<p pid="b.292.0/1" qnum="81733">Given the Government&#8217;s intention to freeze council tax, is the Prime Minister as astounded as I am that Green-run Brighton and Hove council is planning to decline &#163;3 million of council tax grant and is planning instead to raise council tax by 3.5%, so costing local tax payers &#163;4 million?</p>

	<p pid="b.292.1/1">That is a very important point. At a time of difficult household budgets, it is this Government who have cut the petrol tax, and we are freezing the council tax and have made that money available to councils up and down the country. It is a decision for individual councils. If they want the money to go ahead with the council tax freeze, the money is there, but if they reject it, as they plan to in Brighton, that is a huge mistake, because the council will be asking families in Brighton to pay more at a time when it should be on their side.</p>

	<p pid="b.292.3/1">I can certainly give the right hon. Gentleman that assurance. It is important that we take forward the work that the Home Office and the Ministry of Justice have done in looking at a proper, separate offence for stalking and recognising that there is a gap in the current law that we should fill, because there are people who are not getting the protection and help from the police that they need.</p>

	<p pid="b.292.5/1">The great strength of the Localism Act is that we are giving local people a much greater say. In many parts of the country, that will be welcomed, because people can see the advantages of development going ahead, and recognise that if they build extra houses they will keep the council tax and that if they attract extra businesses they will keep the business taxes.

	<p pid="b.293.1/1">I was with the right hon. Gentleman for some of the way through his question, but let us look at the decision the Government have taken. First, we are selling a business that was costing the taxpayer money, and getting well over &#163;700 million for that business. The second thing we are doing, which is in the interests of every single person in this House and everyone in this country, is to get another functioning bank and building society on our high street lending money. How many times do all of us go to our constituency surgeries and hear people say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t get a mortgage&#8221;, or small businesses say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t get a loan&#8221;?

	<p pid="b.293.3/1">I do think the enterprise zones are going to be a success, because we are basing them, as in my hon.

Take, for instance, the enterprise zones at Daresbury science park or at Harwell in Oxfordshire, or the one in Wolverhampton, where Jaguar Land Rover has said that it is going to establish a new plant employing 1,000 people. Enterprise zones are being well applied, they are a good success story, and this Government are right behind them.</p>

On average, somebody who is unemployed for more than six months is six times more likely to contract a serious mental health problem. Does the Prime Minister not worry that we will have a generation of young people who will suffer many of the problems of lack of self-esteem and of never having a first job? Would it not make more sense to guarantee every under 24-year-old a job after six months' unemployment, thus paying them to work, not paying them benefits?</p>

	<p pid="b.293.5/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point about the scarring effect of long-term youth unemployment. We are doing two important things to try to help with that. First, we are helping those not in employment, education or training within three months through the Work programme, rather</p>
	<p pid="b.293.5/2">than the six months under the future jobs fund. Secondly, one of the most successful schemes that there has been in recent years is giving people work experience placements. We will produce evidence on that soon. In many cases, it is leading to direct employment opportunities for young people. The Deputy Prime Minister will say more about that later this week, but we are doing everything that we can to help young people into work and to prevent the scarring effects that the hon. Gentleman talks about.</p>

	<p pid="b.296.4/2">I hear very clearly what the hon. Gentleman says about the office of the chief coroner. I am delighted that we have been able to put forward an amendment and to accept some of those points. The one thing that we should try to avoid&#8212;this is really important, because all of us want to do the right thing for those soldiers and their families who have given so much to our country&#8212;is having an endless right of appeal. I do not think that that would be a good idea. I think it would actually damage the interests of families&#8212;</p>

	Annual Energy Statement
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.299.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40236" speakername="Christopher Huhne" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change"  colnum="299"  time="012:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0001.htm#11112385003357">
	<p pid="b.299.1/1">It is important that when we discuss feed-in tariffs later today we understand the impact of our policies, and that is why we have brought forward the annual energy statement&#8212;so that the House can discuss the matter in its proper context during the debate later.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/2">I am today publishing alongside the annual energy statement a consultation document on secondary legislation to provide for the green deal. It is important that we get this consultation under way as soon as possible because it will allow an expectant industry to begin planning for this vital energy-saving policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/3">The statement on our energy policy fulfils a commitment in the coalition agreement, and in describing the progress made and the policies under way, the statement also honours one of the coalition&#8217;s principles: our commitment to open and transparent government.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/4">The consumer is at the heart of everything we do. Our decisions must ensure that the consumer is protected as far as possible from rising prices, and so we will secure our energy at the lowest cost. We will do so in the short term by promoting competition, in the medium term by insulating our homes and in the long term by steering us away from excessive reliance on fossil fuels and on to clean, green and secure energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/5">The ultimate goals of the Department of Energy and Climate Change are to deliver clean energy for the future and to tackle dangerous climate change. Our vision is of a thriving and globally competitive low-carbon economy with cleaner energy, more efficient homes and lower bills. Over the past 12 months, we have taken significant steps to achieve just that. On both supply and demand, we have begun to deliver key coalition commitments, starting with energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/6">Energy saving is now an equal priority with energy production. An economy that wastes energy cannot thrive in a high-demand, low-emissions world. Improving energy efficiency will save money and cut carbon, which is why we are creating a new energy efficiency deployment office within the Department. Our first task is to make our homes and businesses less leaky and wasteful. The Energy Act 2011, which received Royal Assent earlier this year, provides for the green deal&#8212;the pioneering programme under which businesses will install energy-saving measures in our homes and recoup the costs over decades from the energy savings.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/7">I am today launching the consultation on the secondary legislation that will allow green deals to begin next autumn, including the energy company obligation, which will support those who need the most help. Improving our buildings is vital but we must also change how we warm them in the first place. We are determined to help consumers heat their homes and businesses securely and affordably, and we will publish a heat strategy next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/8">We are also making it easier for people to save energy. In March, we set out the strategy and timetable for introducing smart meters, which can help consumers to manage their energy use. Furthermore, we continue to push for ambitious EU vehicle emissions standards,</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/9">and are providing &#163;300 million in consumer incentives for ultra-low emissions vehicles and further support for research and development.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/10">We are also working to secure Britain&#8217;s energy supplies. We need significant new investment in power plants and infrastructure to meet future demand. In July, we published the White Paper on electricity market reform, heralding the biggest change to the market since privatisation. We are also introducing a new system of long-term contracts, to remove uncertainty and attract investment, and a new mechanism for back-up electricity generation, to keep the lights on. We are setting new standards on emissions from power stations, to ensure that they are clean, and the Treasury is supporting low-carbon generation with a floor price for carbon, to help encourage low-carbon investment in the UK. Together, the reforms will deliver secure, affordable electricity from a diverse mix of sources, including renewables, new nuclear and fossil fuels, including carbon capture and storage.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/11">Each of those energy sources will be important. They will work together in concert to deliver a reliable energy system, and over the past year we have introduced a range of policies to support them. We have published the first ever renewables road map, setting out the barriers to deployment and what must be done to deploy renewable energy at scale. We have also published a consultation on the right level of subsidy to support jobs, investment and growth. Professor Weightman&#8217;s report into nuclear safety after Fukushima reassures me that nuclear can be an important and safe part of the energy mix without public subsidy. In October, as part of our work to enable new nuclear build, I published the regulatory justifications for two reactor designs. Fossil fuels will remain important. That is why we are firmly committed to carbon capture and storage, with &#163;1 billion still available for projects in the CCS programme, despite the disappointment of the Longannet project. Promising projects have been proposed, and we are developing a streamlined selection process, which we will set out shortly. Gas will continue to feature strongly in our energy mix, and our policies are designed to allow new gas plant to be built. I welcome Ofgem&#8217;s proposals to sharpen incentives for reliable gas supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/12">We may need further measures to ensure that we are ready for low-probability, high-impact events. I am asking Ofgem to report to us by next spring on any such measures. We are improving the technical foundation of our energy security. Earlier this month, we laid the statutory security of supply report before Parliament, which sets out future supply and demand forecasts, and discusses risks and drivers. We are also making it easier for new nationally significant energy projects to be delivered. In July, this House approved the national policy statements for energy infrastructure, against which major energy projects will be assessed. Developers can now have greater certainty about how applications for consent will be considered and absolute certainty on when decisions will be made, with statutory time scales to ensure investor confidence.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/13">Our actions will maintain the diversity and security of our energy supplies. We are working hard to ensure that they are delivered at the lowest possible cost. In a world of volatile fossil fuel prices&#8212;we all know about the events in the middle east and Libya&#8212;those objectives complement each other. We believe that the policies we have introduced will deliver the best value for consumers,</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/14">as we move towards a cleaner energy future. However, as we embark on the transformation of our energy system, we must take people with us. That is why I am today publishing an assessment of prices and bills, and the impact of our policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/15">Overall, we anticipate that rising world gas prices will push up bills for both gas and electricity, but our policies will moderate that rise. By 2020, we expect household bills to be 7%&#8212;or &#163;94&#8212;lower than they would otherwise be without our policies. Moreover, bills will be lower during this Parliament. Britain&#8217;s homes will be cheaper to heat and to light than if we did nothing, in this Parliament and in the longer term. Those savings will result above all from our energy-saving policies and from market reform. In addition, we decided to fund the renewable heat incentive and carbon capture and storage commitments from general taxation, rather than from planned levies.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/16">To sum up again, rising global fossil fuel prices and decades of under-investment will mean that prices for energy will rise in the UK, just as they will elsewhere. We cannot control global gas prices, but we can, as a Government, soften the blow. Prices and bills are forecast to rise, but we can ensure that they rise less than they would otherwise have done.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/17">We want to leave a fairer energy legacy than those before us did. Between 2001 and 2009, fuel poverty doubled. The warm home discount and the affordable warmth part of the ECO, on which we are consulting, are targeted at the poorest and most vulnerable households. The warm home discount will support up to 2 million homes each year, helping more than 600,000 poorer pensioners, with &#163;120 off their energy bills this winter. Other vulnerable people will also be eligible for a rebate. That discount scheme is worth two thirds more than the voluntary scheme that operated under the last Government. The Warm Front programme helped 130,000 households last year, providing advice and installing heating and insulation, with a further 90,000 set to benefit over the next two years. As it phases out, the affordable warmth part of the ECO subsidies will phase in to replace it.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/18">We are also helping consumers more generally to take advantage of a competitive energy market. Consumers could save up to &#163;200 by shopping around for the lowest online rate, but last year fewer than one in five households switched suppliers. We are making it easier and faster to switch, and we have launched a campaign to encourage consumers to check, switch and insulate to save.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/19">We are also mindful of the impact on businesses. Earlier this year we published our proposals on the simplification of the CRC&#8212;carbon reduction commitment&#8212;energy efficiency scheme and for the new climate change agreements. We are committed to simplifying the regulatory burden on industry, while driving behaviour change to improve efficiency and reduce emissions.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/20">Lower levels of energy efficiency savings mean that our policies will typically have a larger impact on energy bills for businesses. By 2020, policies are estimated to add 19% to the average energy bill of businesses that are medium-sized energy consumers. For large energy-intensive users, who are more exposed to fossil fuel price volatility, that figure is between 2% and 20%. It is important that these industries play their part in the transition to a low-carbon economy, but it is also important that they remain competitive. That is why we are working with</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/21">the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Treasury to announce measures before the end of the year to support those energy-intensive industries whose competitiveness is most at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/22">The energy sector is a vital part of our economy. Energy industries employ 173,000 people, contribute nearly 4% of our gross domestic product and provide more than half of our industrial investment. More than 51,000 companies in Britain provide low-carbon and environmental goods and services. Exports are now &#163;11.3 billion a year&#8212;up 3.9%. Last year, nearly 4,500 new jobs were created in the sector, which grew by 4.3%.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/23">We expect that our policies, like the renewable heat incentive, will strengthen supply chains across the country, bringing jobs and growth. The green deal alone will kick-start at least &#163;14 billion of investment in the decade to 2022 and support at least 65,000 insulation and construction jobs by 2015. We want to ensure that young people today can play their part in the industries of tomorrow, so we are supporting green apprenticeships to build the skilled work force we need to deliver the green deal.</p>
	<p pid="b.299.1/24">In conclusion, between now and 2030, our relationship with energy will change fundamentally. We have to build a new energy portfolio&#8212;one that is equal to our changing needs and our ambitious carbon targets. It has to be supported by a new consensus. Helping consumers to understand their energy costs, and how our policies affect them, is key. The decisions we take now will affect the way our energy is delivered for decades to come. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.302.0/1">We are grateful to the Secretary of State, who has significantly exceeded his time. I gently remind him of the merits of the use of the blue pencil. So far as today is concerned, I must obviously make an allowance in respect of the response from the shadow Secretary of State.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.302.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40206" speakername="Caroline Flint" colnum="302"  time="012:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0001.htm#11112385003359">
	<p pid="b.302.1/1">I thank the Secretary of State for briefing the media about his statement today, before informing either the House or the Opposition. Is it any surprise that he is becoming increasingly rattled by growing opposition from his own Benches to the Government&#8217;s cuts in the solar power sector, and has chosen to bring his statement forward in order to squeeze time in our Opposition day debate this afternoon? Perhaps he is also trying to put a gloss on the Government&#8217;s energy policy before the energy statistics are published tomorrow&#8212;or perhaps advisers or lobbyists with &#8220;excellent contacts&#8221; with Ministers advised him to bring his statement forward. Whatever the reason, disrespect has been shown to the House today.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/2">The Secretary of State said, &#8220;The consumer is at the heart of everything we do.&#8221; Will he start by telling us what the Government will actually do to deal with soaring energy prices? Energy bills are up by 20% this year, and standard tariffs rose by &#163;175 between June and November alone, driving up inflation and squeezing household budgets. The Government, however, are so out of touch that their only answer is to tell people to shop around, and their only policy is to cut help to pensioners this winter. Can the Secretary of State explain why, with the end of the Warm Front scheme, for the first time since the 1970s a British Government are not offering grants to help to reduce fuel poverty?</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/3">The most effective and sustainable way of cutting bills is to reduce energy use, but the Government&#8217;s flagship energy efficiency programme, the green deal, has been delayed and is in chaos. We were expecting the green deal consultation back in September. More than two months later, it has finally appeared, but we are still not clear about what incentives households will be offered to take up the green deal, or what the Government will do to ensure that the 10p rate for a green deal package is low enough to secure the widest possible range of energy efficiency measures and the best deal for bill payers. Can the Secretary of State confirm that the Government&#8217;s forecast of the number of jobs to be created by the green deal has been slashed from 100,000 to just 65,000 by 2015?</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/4">Earlier this year, my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition set out bold plans to break the dominance of the big six by requiring energy companies to sell power into a pool, thus allowing new suppliers to enter the market, increasing competition, and driving up choice for consumers. Will the Secretary of State explain why he is so afraid of standing up to vested interests in the energy industry, and delivering the reform that our energy market needs?</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/5">The green economy currently employs 800,000 people. It is estimated that the global market for low-carbon goods and services will be worth &#163;4 trillion by 2015, with the potential to create 400,000 new jobs, but as a direct result of the uncertainty that the Government have created, the UK is falling behind. Last year, when we left office, it was ranked third in the world for investment in green growth. We are now ranked 13th, behind Brazil and India. That is bad for our economy, bad for our energy security, and bad for the prices that consumers pay, because it makes us ever more reliant on events overseas that are beyond our control.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/6">Just yesterday, the Science and Technology Committee in the House of Lords accused the Government of complacency over the skills required for the nuclear industry. Given that power stations in the UK already import staff from the southern hemisphere to run them, given that many of the firms currently providing solar power are about to go to the wall, and given that British Gas has just announced that 850 jobs are to go, will the Secretary of State tell the House how he plans to halt the worrying decline in investment in the UK?</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/7">We look forward to the Government&#8217;s forthcoming announcements on how they propose to support energy-intensive industries, and we hope that their proposals will extend to both gas and electricity, but will the Secretary of State tell us exactly how much of the proceeds of CRC are going back into Treasury coffers? Under Labour's scheme, the money was returned to the hands of businesses to be invested in energy efficiency.</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/8">We shall have time to deal with the Government&#8217;s cuts in feed-in tariffs later this afternoon, but what sort of message does this whole debacle send out? How can the Government encourage investors to support the renewable heat incentive, the green deal or any other green policies in the future, when a growing sector, built on a flagship policy that had cross-party support, has been cut off at the knees with just six weeks&#8217; notice? How can anyone have enough confidence to make the</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/9">investment that we need when the Government are so short-sighted and so short-term, and chop and change their policies at every turn?</p>
	<p pid="b.302.1/10">Today&#8217;s statement is just more evidence that the Government are out of touch, are cutting too far and too fast, and have no plans for jobs and growth.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.304.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40236" speakername="Christopher Huhne" colnum="304"  time="012:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0001.htm#11112385003360">
	<p pid="b.304.0/1">The right hon. Lady asked what we were doing to help those who face substantial increases in energy bills. Over the last year there has been a 38% increase in world gas prices for delivery this winter, and that will inevitably be reflected in both gas and electricity bills. We have tried to protect consumers by taking the renewable heat incentive off the levy system and into general public expenditure, and by taking similar action in relation to carbon capture and storage. We have capped the feed-in tariff, and we are helping the consumer as much as we possibly can.</p>
	<p pid="b.304.0/2">Far from our being afraid to take on the big six, Ofgem has clamped down on mis-selling, and we have ensured that the big six must inform people before raising tariffs. We have reduced the period within which consumers can switch suppliers to three weeks, and we are considering giving Ofgem powers to require companies to provide redress. All those steps constitute clear evidence of the determination of the Government and Ofgem to make this a highly competitive retail and wholesale market, which is the best guarantee for consumers that they will be given the best possible deal now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.304.0/3">The right hon. Lady mentioned the Warm Front scheme. She gave us no credit for the fact that the consultation documents on the green deal that were published today clearly show that we are replacing that scheme with the affordable warmth obligation referred to in the ECO consultation, or for the fact that the warm homes discount scheme is now statutory&#8212;it is not a voluntary scheme like that operated by the Labour Government&#8212;and will make the discounts available to those experiencing fuel poverty two thirds higher than those provided by the old voluntary scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.304.0/4">The right hon. Lady asked about incentives. The Chancellor of the Exchequer could not have made it clearer in his Budget speech that he would consider them. I believe that if the right hon. Lady waits for a matter of weeks, all will be made clear in regard to the Chancellor&#8217;s commitment to ensuring that the green deal is a great success. She should also bear in mind that we have already provided incentives, in addition to those that the Chancellor is considering. For example, all F and G-rated homes in the private rented sector will have to be upgraded by 2018 so that tenants can enjoy the benefits of energy saving.</p>
	<p pid="b.304.0/5">Finally, the right hon. Lady asked what we were doing to encourage investment. The whole purpose of the electricity market reform which will be the centrepiece of the energy Bill that we will present in the second Session in May, and which we have already announced in the White Paper, is to provide the certainty that will lead to investment which, for years, the last Labour Government failed to deliver. A quarter of our power stations are going offline in the next 10 years: a quarter of our capacity. What did the last Labour Government do? Nothing&#8212;absolutely nothing. Yet the right hon. Lady, seemingly arriving from Mars, has had the temerity to come here today and pretend that we are</p>
	<p pid="b.304.0/6">not taking action, as if the last Labour Government had. I have to hand it to her: for sheer brass neck, she gets the prize.</p>

	<p pid="b.305.2/1">My right hon. Friend made the breathtaking claim that he intended to keep energy prices as low as possible. How does he square that with the Stern review, on which his policy to combat climate change is based, and which makes clear that that policy can work only if energy prices are raised to include the external cost of global heating, and if the cost of hydrocarbon-based energy is also raised to make it more expensive than other forms of sustainable energy? In short, if his policy is not hurting, it is not working.</p>

If he is in any way unsatisfied with the explanations that we have given in the documents&#8212;explanations which are considerably more detailed than those provided by any previous Government&#8212;he should ask for a briefing, and we will ensure that he receives any additional answers that he may require.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.3/2">The key point, however, is that a substantial part of what we need to do to tackle climate change involves measures included in our green deal legislation which pay for themselves and do not involve a cost, while those that do involve a cost&#8212;namely the raising of prices to enable us to move to a low-carbon economy when it comes to electricity generation&#8212;are offset by the reduction in energy volumes precisely because of our energy-saving measures.</p>

On carbon capture and storage, the Secretary of State knows that despite all the excitement about feed-in tariffs, renewables and nuclear, the world, including the United Kingdom, will mainly be using fossil fuels for the next few decades. What is happening in respect of CCS? There have been some disappointments in recent months. When does the Secretary of State think the first CCS plant in the UK will be operating and helping to clean up our planet?</p>

	<p pid="b.305.5/1">I certainly did not want to imply that the right hon. Gentleman, who has considerable expertise in this area, was in any way slacking when he was an Energy Minister&#8212;although I think he might have had better support from his colleagues on certain occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.5/2">CCS is a key technology. The right hon. Gentleman is absolutely right to say that we are going to continue to be reliant on gas and other fossil fuels. If we move to</p>
	<p pid="b.305.5/3">unabated gas rather than coal, that in itself will save about half the carbon emissions. For the longer term however, CCS is essential if we are going to be able to use gas, especially if we find, as I hope we will, that we have considerable exploitable reserves of shale gas under Lancashire and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="b.305.5/4">As I have said, Longannet was a disappointment&#8212;I made a statement to the House on that&#8212;but other projects are coming forward. Peterhead is nearer the reservoirs than Longannet, so the pipeline costs are likely to be lower, and less investment will be needed to upgrade the plant in line with the large combustion plant directive. All the parties who were involved in the Longannet negotiation are confident that we can deliver a commercial-scale CCS plant for within that &#163;1 billion budget, and we intend to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.306.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point. He is absolutely right. If we are going to introduce minimum standards for offshore oil and gas&#8212;the Commission has been kind enough to say they should be modelled on those for the UK continental shelf&#8212;that should be on the basis of a directive, so that we can use our own legal means to enforce the standards, rather than a regulation. A regulation that would apply directly in all the member states would be inappropriate because countries&#8217; circumstances are inevitably different.</p>

As the ECO will be split into two pots&#8212;the hard to treat and the fuel poor&#8212;will the Secretary of State ensure that the latter group does not end up in effect subsidising the former, by making sure he focuses on the fuel poor, the 1.9 million households in fuel poverty who happen to live in hard-to-treat homes?</p>

That is why we have increased the amount of warm home discount compared with the voluntary schemes. I disagree with her that the ECO subsidy is an ineffective way of reaching such people or that it is more regressive than other schemes. The fact that the previous scheme was Exchequer-funded was by the by. What is important is achieving the key outcome of tackling the root causes of fuel poverty, and that we will do.</p>

We want to be as transparent as possible, because it is important that people understand that although there will be price increases, we can, particularly as a result of our energy-saving measures, also get volumes down, which is crucial to getting bills down.

However, is it not true that the Longannet project was much more important to the country because it is a coal-powered station, as opposed to the gas-powered station at Peterhead, and coal is the main export market for CCS? Is it not also the case that Shell and Scottish Power have got their sums right, and that their assessment of the investment required for the CCS power we need is much more realistic than the Government&#8217;s? We have thrown away the great potential of a large export market.</p>

	<p pid="b.307.2/1">CCS is a catch-all for a substantial number of different types of technology designed to do the same thing: take the carbon out of the process of the combustion of fossil fuels. I disagree about gas versus coal, as I think gas, along with coal, will play a very important part in world supply for a long time, and there will be substantial CCS markets in both of them. It is important that the UK is in the lead in that.</p>

Also, nuclear is generally not welcome in the middle of our cities. For those reasons transmission charging should be amended. Ofgem is looking at that at present, but it is up to it to do so as an independent regulator.</p>

It is on course to be announced by the end of the year, which is what we were committed to doing, and it is also a matter of regret to me that the announcement was made about the Rio Tinto Alcan plant before the managers had the opportunity to read what we were able to say, which suggests to me that they had previously made up their mind.</p>

	<p pid="b.310.1/1">My hon. Friend raises an interesting point. We have cut the subsidies for the offshore and onshore wind industry, too, and we have done so because this Government are firmly committed to making sure that we deliver what we intend to deliver&#8212;that is, the shift to a low carbon economy&#8212;at the lowest possible cost to British consumers. I am sure that we will have a greater opportunity to debate this subject later today, but I merely point out that the subsidies for solar feed-in tariffs now reflect a substantial fall in the costs of the underlying technology. That fall in costs, caused by the global changes in circumstances over the past year, means that those subsidies are providing a very similar real rate of return to that which was planned when the scheme was launched in April 2010.</p>

I would like to make a point about the scheduling of this annual energy statement on an Opposition day when we have two extremely important debates with very short time limits for speakers. The statement was not a time-sensitive one and I hope that you will agree with me and deplore the fact that it was scheduled in Opposition time.

Thirdly, the contents of the statement were extensively leaked to the same tweeting <i>Guardian</i> correspondent and appeared on its website at 10.35 this morning.

	<p pid="b.314.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her point of order, and I shall seek to the best of my ability to respond to each of her three points in turn. First, the timing of Government statements is a matter for the Government and I do not want to get into the merits or demerits of choosing a particular day, but the point will have been heard by the Deputy Leader of the House and, at a distance from the Chamber, by the Leader of the House. Secondly, let me emphasise that notification of an intended statement should first and foremost be to other hon. and right hon. Members and the shadow team. It should not be to members of the press. That is disorderly and discourteous. Thirdly, I listened intently to the Secretary of State, as I always do, when he responded to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40641" name="Peter Bone">the hon. Member for Wellingborough (Mr Bone)</phrase>. He assured the House that he had not spoken to journalists about the contents of the statement, and of course I accept without hesitation what he says on that point. However, I would just gently&#8212;or perhaps not so gently&#8212;remind the Secretary of State that it is not just a question of Ministers not talking to the media. Ministers must not encourage, facilitate or permit any of their team, officials or advisers to do so either. This is the second time this week that there has been an instance of substantial information in a statement being conveyed first to the media. It will be a pity if further measures have to be contemplated and adopted for dealing with situations of this kind. I hope that the Secretary of State will take what I have said as a deterrent against any future such occurrence.</p>

	<p pid="b.314.3/2">were simply wrong, and that his statement and the Prime Minister&#8217;s comments were simply incorrect. The calculator showed that low and middle earners would get less at comparable retirement rates. The calculator has since been taken down from the website.</p>
	<p pid="b.314.3/3">Three million public sector workers may go on strike on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-30">30 November</phrase> unless the dispute is resolved, so it is vital that accurate information be provided to the House and to the general public. The Chief Secretary has unwittingly conveyed inaccurate information to the House and, through you, Mr Speaker, I would ask that he be requested to return to the House to correct the error and provide an accurate assessment of the Government&#8217;s pension proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.317.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide that any Member of Parliament who changes voluntarily his or her political party affiliation described on the ballot paper at the time he or she was elected is deemed to have vacated his or her seat; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/3">This Bill seeks to ensure that any Member who decides to change parties&#8212;in other words, crosses the Floor or &#8220;defects&#8221;, should trigger an automatic by-election so that their constituents can have the final say on their decision. I realise that some Members may have hesitations about such a Bill. It would, after all, seek to overturn centuries of tradition that have allowed Members to change parties with little regard for their constituents&#8217; opinion on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/4">At the same time, the question of Members changing parties is not a new one. Former and current Members from all political parties have taken the decision to do so, including a former Prime Minister. Equally, former Members from every political party have previously called for a defecting MP to give their constituents the right to validate their decision. Let me be clear: I do not take issue with the right of Members to defect from parties. In an established democracy, we must value the freedom of individual Members to cross the Floor if they so wish. I can fully accept and understand that Members may, at times, no longer find themselves at one with the party they joined. I ask only that they give their constituents the same choice that they themselves have been able to make.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/5">Nor do I wish to criticise any Member or former Member for the action they have taken, or the judgments they have made according to their own conscience. They will have to live with them. However, it is neither right nor fair that a constituent should live with that decision, often for many years, until a general election is called. According to the House of Commons Library there has never been a debate in the House on this issue. At a time when the public&#8217;s faith in our political system is at a low ebb, and when trust in politics remains broken, I believe that this is precisely the kind of topic that we should be debating.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/6">If we asked any man or woman on the street the solution would be obvious: if an MP is elected for a certain party, only to decide to defect to another, it is only right that they should allow their constituents a say on their decision. That is the honest thing to do, and it is the right thing to do. It is easy to state the historical arguments against this Bill, mostly stemming from Edmund Burke&#8217;s speech to the electors of Bristol in 1774. Burke argued that we are sent here as representatives, not delegates, and as such sit in the House as individuals, not bound by party constraint, but each free to choose how we best represent our constituents, even if that seems to be against their best interests.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/7">The notion that constituents vote for their Members of Parliament as individuals to exercise their judgment on behalf of their constituents, and not to stand for the party ticket on which they were elected, may have been</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/8">relevant in the 18th century, but that is no longer the case in the 21st century. We can no longer continue the charade that we are each elected solely as individuals. To do so is simply not to be speaking the same language as our constituents. It is an undeniable truth that the vast majority of constituents will vote for the party, with the Member the embodiment of the party locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/9">Parties clearly do matter, otherwise there would be no need for a Member to change from one party to another. Such a Member may as well sit as an independent. Indeed, let those who wish to maintain the illusion, and believe that we are elected as sole individuals, stand as individuals, devoid of a party banner.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/10">There are precedents in this House for a political defection to trigger a by-election. Bruce Douglas-Mann voluntarily triggered one in 1982, in the Mitcham and Morden constituency, when he left Labour for the Social Democratic party. He followed in footsteps of Dick Taverne, who in 1973 resigned from the Labour party, only to call a by-election and be re-elected under the banner of Democratic Labour. By-elections like these should be the rule, not the exception.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/11">Nor would the Bill be the first to legislate on a Member of Parliament&#8217;s defection. Defection laws have been passed in India, providing that someone can be disqualified for voluntarily giving up</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/12">&#8220;membership of his original political party&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/13">Of 193 countries worldwide, 41 have laws about crossing the Floor. Indeed, in Canada, a Bill almost identical to my own was debated only this month.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/14">I do not deny that this change in the law would raise other issues that would need to be investigated fully, but I would welcome the scrutiny that the House could provide by debating the merits and demerits of the Bill. For instance, the reason why I suggest that the Bill should apply only to Members who have voluntarily changed parties is to ensure that the withdrawal of the Whip would not affect a Member&#8217;s ability to remain as a representative. It is not the Bill&#8217;s intention to strengthen the party system, or to strengthen the control of any parliamentary party. It is intended only to strengthen the hand of our constituents. Loyalty to our constituents lies at the forefront of what we all, whichever political party we stand for, wish to achieve as Members of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/15">Edmund Burke once stated that he was a Member of Parliament, not the Member for Bristol. As a proud Bristolian, I am the Member for Kingswood first and a Member of Parliament second. We have a choice: we can stand by the arguments first formulated more than 200 years ago, noble though they are, or we can choose to face forwards, into the 21st century, and accept that we cannot go on as we have done. We must accept that the status quo cannot remain, and that we must seek to form a new relationship with our voters, our constituents&#8212;the men and women who put us here in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/16">The central issue must be one of trust. At a time when the public want politicians to be more accountable, if a Member of this House decides to defect, it should lie with the voters and the constituents whether that Member should remain a Member of Parliament or not. We need to look beyond the confines of this Chamber, and ask ourselves what is so wrong with a Member who defects from one party to another asking their constituents&#8217; opinion. What should any defecting</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/17">MP be so afraid of? Who are we to turn our backs on our constituents&#8212;the voters who placed us here&#8212;without their assent? Without them we are nothing.</p>
	<p pid="b.317.2/18">I end by paraphrasing the words of that other Bristol MP, John Locke: &#8220;Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his honesty, and he betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices that to his ambition.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.319.0/1">Edwina Currie had the bright idea of having equal numbers of men and women in the House by pairing constituencies and saying that the man who go the most votes and the woman who got the most votes each became a Member of Parliament. I asked her what would happen if someone went in for gender reassignment between one election and another, and she thought I was not being sufficiently serious.</p>
	<p pid="b.319.0/2">When I first started taking an interest in politics, I do not think we had party labels on the ballot paper. I think it would not be a bad thing if we removed them and showed only candidates&#8217; names and addresses. Incidentally, I do not know whether my hon. Friend would suggest that if I changed my address between one election and another I should have a by-election, because that was on the ballot paper as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.319.0/3">I do not think many of us would get elected without parties, but the key point is that we have a duty to our constituents and to our party, and we have international obligations as well. In my view the trust comes from what we do, not from whether we decide to change our party. We are at present in coalition with the Liberal Democrats. The Liberal Democrats include people who were Social Democrats. The Social Democrats, in the main, unless they were political virgins, came from the Labour party, so there has been significant moving around.</p>
	<p pid="b.319.0/4">We could approach this matter from the point of view of narrow self-interest. Do we as the Conservatives, or we as the coalition with the Liberal Democrats, expect to get more people from the Labour party to come and join us, or do we expect to lose more people? If we expect to gain more people, which is what I hope we are going to do, we should not support the Bill. We should say, &#8220;Come across and perhaps we&#8217;ll see if we can look after you at the next election as well. It may</p>
	<p pid="b.319.0/5">mean changing your seat, as one or two Conservatives who switched to Labour did, but we can have a go.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.319.0/6">Then we come to Burke. Edmund Burke is quoted far too often. He bears the penalty of fighting his great campaign against Warren Hastings for five years, tying up Westminster Hall and stopping the visitors having a good look round. But we forget that having made his declaration of the duties of a Member of Parliament, at the next election he lost his seat. Losing the seat at the election is what such a Member should take the chance of doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.319.0/7">We have had voluntary by-elections. Our right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40293" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)</phrase> caused a by-election to say that he still agreed with what he had said at the previous election so could he be re-elected, and he was. We had the time when the Ulster Unionists, who do not seem to be present at the moment, had by-elections en masse for some reason that we have now forgotten. We ought to recognise that although my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40347" name="Chris Skidmore">the Member for Kingswood (Chris Skidmore)</phrase> is absolutely right&#8212;there is no better historian in the House now than he&#8212;in saying that the matter ought to be debated, the idea that it should be the subject of a Bill that should be enacted is controvertible, and I would say that it is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.319.0/8">The House should not be delayed by too many of the greater arguments on this, except of course if we wanted to return to the glory days. Was there not a time when if someone elected as a Back-Bench Member of Parliament was invited to become a Minister, a by-election had to be held? It would be a real test of popularity, especially if a reshuffle came, to make it a requirement that any Back Bencher who became a Minister had to fight a by-election, and anyone who stood at a general election as a Minister and succeeded, but then lost their ministerial position, should also be required to fight a by-election. If by-elections are a good idea, let us have more of them.</p>

	<p pid="b.321.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House notes with concern that UK economic growth is flatlining and was choked off well before the recent Eurozone crisis, that youth unemployment is now more than one million and that Government borrowing is therefore expected to be &#163;46 billion higher than forecast over the Parliament; further notes with regret that the Government has failed to deliver a credible growth plan, is undermining critical industries in which the UK must compete, is failing to use strategically procurement and other tools to drive growth and innovation, and is holding back regional growth with its flagship projects mired in inertia and with most business still waiting for Regional Growth Fund money seven months after the recipients were announced; therefore calls on the Government to deliver a growth plan that provides an immediate boost to the economy to increase demand and growth, including a &#163;2 billion tax on bank bonuses to fund 100,000 jobs for young people and build 25,000 more affordable homes; and further calls on the Government to bring forward long-term investment projects to get people back to work, to reverse the damaging VAT rise of January 2011 for a temporary period giving families a &#163;450 boost and providing immediate help for the UK&#8217;s high streets, to provide a one-year cut in VAT to five per cent. on home improvements, repairs and maintenance to help home owners and small businesses, and to provide a one-year national insurance tax break for small firms to help them grow and create jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/3">In his Conservative party conference speech last October, the Chancellor said he would stick to his plan to cut faster than any other Chancellor in our history, regardless of the consequences, because, he said, it was necessary to put our economy on a sound footing. With reference to the Business Secretary he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/4">&#8220;Together, Vince and I have started to open Britain for business.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/5">A year later, what do we find? The economy has grown by just 0.5% in the past 12 months. This compares with growth of 1.5% in the US over the same period and is significantly down from the 2.6% growth in the previous 12 months, thanks to the measures taken by the Labour Government. Have the Chancellor and the Business Secretary opened Britain for business? The figures tell a different story. The number of UK enterprises fell by 20,000 in the year to March 2011, with decreases in business numbers in every region except London and Scotland, and business confidence nose-dived following the announcement of the Chancellor&#8217;s spending review.</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/6">What effect is this having on the people of this country? More than 2.6 million people are out of work, the highest rate in 17 years. More than 1 million young people are now out of work, the highest since comparable records began in 1992. Let me be clear: these are not our statistics. They are those of the Office for National Statistics. They are the facts.</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/7">How have the Government responded to the facts? Last week, when we learned of the youth unemployment figures, the Prime Minister and the Chancellor were nowhere to be seen. Instead, the Minister with responsibility for employment took to the airwaves. He told us that the 1 million figure for youth unemployment was &#8220;a distraction.&#8221; The 1 million figure for youth unemployment is not a distraction. It is a disgrace. What a tragic waste</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/8">of talent. He not only described the figure of 1 million as a distraction, but attempted to blame it on the eurozone crisis. Does he really think that the British people will fall for that?</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/9">In fairness to the Business Secretary, when the figures came out his unofficial spokesperson, the noble Lord Oakeshott, told <i>The Guardian</i>:</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/10">&#8220;It&#8217;s ridiculous to blame this rise in unemployment on the crisis in the eurozone. All economists know it&#8217;s a lagging indicator, so this is the result of what has been happening in our economy over the past year&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.321.2/11">I could not put it better myself. Despite that view, the Business Secretary remains resolutely wedded to the Government&#8217;s economic strategy, however disastrous it is turning out to be. He does so in the name of deficit reduction, yet the independent forecasts published last week show that the Government are projected to borrow, on average, more in each remaining year of this Parliament than we would have done under our more balanced deficit reduction plan. Those are neither the Opposition&#8217;s figures, nor those published by the Office for National Statistics; the summary of independent forecasts was published last week by the Government themselves. Of course, the Office for Budget Responsibility has already forecast borrowing to be &#163;46 billion higher than previously thought. The evidence is clear: the Government&#8217;s strategy is not working because reducing borrowing requires growth, which they choked off by cutting spending and raising taxes too far and too fast, and long before the eurozone crisis.</p>

He noted that according to later assessments the deficit will be higher than originally estimated, but does he accept that the key thing the Government got right was to set the tone for interest rates so that this country&#8217;s businesses can benefit from much lower interest rates than those in other countries, and would not the policies that his party proposes put that at risk?</p>

Of course, another question for the Government is why they will not listen to business organisations that have been calling for action. The CBI is calling for infrastructure spending to be brought forward, the Federation of Small Businesses is calling for a one-year national insurance break for every small firm taking on extra workers, and the Federation of Master Builders would like a targeted cut in VAT to 5% for home improvements, maintenance and repairs. Business organisations, from those representing the food and beverage sectors to those representing businesses on our high streets, which are suffering, are calling for a reversal of this year&#8217;s hike in VAT. What do all those measures have in common? They are all part of Labour&#8217;s plan for growth and jobs.

	<p pid="b.324.2/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. We all know what is holding back business in taking on workers: the forecast economic projections for this country. That is the real problem. What has been the centrepiece of the Business Secretary&#8217;s alternative offer? How will he turn things around? The answer is the regional growth fund. The aim of the fund is to unlock private sector investment, support areas that are dependent on the public sector and help them become more balanced economies. Good. We take no issue with those objectives. We want that money to get to business and to create the jobs that will support growth, yet the scheme has been managed shambolically. It has been an utter fiasco. The fund is a third of the size of the moneys distributed through the regional development agencies, which have been scrapped without effective replacement, so it has been hugely over-subscribed, which demonstrates businesses&#8217; craving for capital. Of the 956 bids received, only 50 were successful in the first round and 119 in the second round. There have been many more losers than winners. It is difficult for the losers, but what of the winners?</p>
	<p pid="b.324.2/2">Of course, due diligence is needed to ensure the proper use of public funds. The permanent secretary at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills told the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee that due diligence on successful bids tends to take between two and six weeks, and that until it is complete the successful bidder is not given its money. Yet, clearly, very few successful bidders have received what was promised, because it has taken so long for due diligence to be completed.</p>
	<p pid="b.324.2/3">I have written to the Secretary of State and tabled parliamentary questions, and in fact the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford, who has continually chuntered from a sedentary position today, provided the answers. I tabled those questions to get the answers, to get the facts and to get to the bottom of the delays and mess.</p>
	<p pid="b.324.2/4">On Monday I received answers to those parliamentary questions, indicating that 30 weeks&#8212;30 weeks&#8212;after the original announcement just nine of the 50 first-round winners have completed due diligence. When I asked why due diligence has taken so long, I was told:</p>
	<p pid="b.324.2/5">&#8220;It is for successful bidders to initiate due diligence upon receipt of a conditional offer letter from the Department.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-11-21.154"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 November 2011; Vol. 536, c. 154W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.324.2/6">Usually, the Government blame us for all the mistakes; now, it seems that they are seeking to pass on blame to the very businesses that they claim to want to help&#8212;and the bidder has to pay for the due diligence cost, too.</p>

	<p pid="b.325.1/2">Last week I met one of the first-round bidders, who told me that on learning of their successful bid in April they immediately sought to progress due diligence but, despite chasing the Secretary of State&#8217;s Department, received no further documentation for four months. When they got it, they immediately responded but, again, heard nothing for another three months&#8212;until around the time that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition raised the issue of the regional growth fund at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions. I am sure that the timing was totally coincidental.</p>
	<p pid="b.325.1/3">Even now, formal due diligence is not complete, and the matter is due to go to the permanent secretary&#8217;s committee for approval on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-02">2 December</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.325.2/1">On that important point, the Institute of Chartered Accountants believes that one reason for the length of time taken on due diligence is the disappearance of the RDAs&#8217; expertise in following up the process, and the efficiency savings within the Department, meaning that the skills base there has evaporated, too. Is that not the case?</p>

	<p pid="b.325.4/1">I reiterate the point about the expertise that has been lost due to the abolition of the RDAs, but also the European regional development fund is another vital source of money for businesses. Millions of pounds, particularly in the north-east, remain unspent, and only one fund, from the regional growth fund in Manchester, has been used as match funding for ERD funding. That is a huge waste of important business support that could be going to people throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.325.5/1">Perhaps the Secretary of State will address that comment in his response.</p>
	<p pid="b.325.5/2">Almost one year after the regional growth fund was announced, and six months after due diligence should have been completed, the winning bidder to which I have referred has still not received any money from the regional growth fund. It is clear to me, in that case, where the blame lies for the delay: it is not with the successful bidder. That organisation provides onward distribution of fund awards to businesses that desperately need it. As a result of the chaos, confusion and delay, the bidder in that case tells me that between 3,000 and 4,000 businesses are being deprived of the moneys they need, putting an estimated 11,800 jobs at risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.325.5/3">What about the other bidders that provide the onward distribution of funds, and the businesses that could support jobs and growth? As I have said, the situation is a fiasco. It is no way to run a Department, and it is no way to treat our businesses or grow our economy. The Secretary of State and his Department are not doing enough to get our economy growing; what little they are doing, they are doing badly.</p>

	<p pid="b.326.1/1">With the greatest respect to the hon.

It has failed to do so. I do not claim that there was a nirvana in relation to RDAs, but we are talking about the regional growth fund, and we actually want it to succeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.326.1/2">The Government&#8217;s latest attempt to grow the economy consists of making it easier to fire, not hire, people. Today, to great fanfare, the Secretary of State said that the service required to claim for unfair dismissal should be increased from one to two years. He said this morning that</p>
	<p pid="b.326.1/3">&#8220;this will mean that business can once again have the confidence to hire the staff they need to grow and thrive.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.326.3/1">I am glad that my right hon.

	<p pid="b.327.0/1">My hon.

	<p pid="b.327.11/1">I have given way several times, and I want to make a bit of progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.327.11/2">Instead of reverting to the tired old mantras and doing over the people who work in this country, perhaps the Secretary of State could tell us what he will do to get</p>
	<p pid="b.327.11/3">banks lending to small and medium-sized businesses that are, by his and the Chancellor&#8217;s own admission, currently being starved of credit. We know that the Project Merlin accord between the banks and the Government failed. The Secretary of State more or less admitted as much when he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.327.11/4">&#8220;Merlin was necessary but it was never going to be sufficient. I don&#8217;t think any of us pretended it was enough.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.327.11/5">We know that the figures published under Merlin are entirely misleading, because under the agreement between the banks and the Government a gross lending measure was adopted, not the more meaningful net figure used by the Bank of England. The truth is that Project Merlin was really no more than a public relations gimmick designed to get the Government out of a hole when banks&#8217; declarations of bonuses were in full flow earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="b.327.11/6">For real businesses, the failure is real. The Bank of England&#8217;s &#8220;Trends in Lending&#8221; publication for last month showed the stock of lending to UK businesses contracting overall in the three months to August. The Bank&#8217;s latest agents&#8217; summary, for this month, stated that small businesses were still reporting that credit conditions</p>
	<p pid="b.327.11/7">&#8220;remained tight, and in some cases had become tighter.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.327.11/8">That is supported by the figures released this morning by the British Bankers Association, showing lending by the high street banking groups to non-financial businesses contracting this month.</p>
	<p pid="b.327.11/9">To resolve that problem, the Government first need to change their overall economic strategy, to give businesses the confidence to borrow and grow. The small and medium-sized enterprise finance monitor published last week showed that the main barrier to future borrowing by SMEs was the economic climate, but that the other major barrier was the lending practices of the banks. The Government need to use their influence with the banks, particularly through United Kingdom Financial Investments in the case of the banks in which the state has a stake, to insist that they get money out of the door to responsible businesses that have sound business models but are struggling to access finance. In addition, they must urge those banks to adopt a better lending culture&#8212;for example, by ensuring that they have local relationship managers on the ground who get to know the business concerned.</p>

	<p pid="b.328.0/1">I am sure the whole House has considerable sympathy with the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s position. Unfortunately, the Government&#8217;s hands are somewhat tied, because UKFI was set up on the basis that it was at arm&#8217;s length. When the original deal was done with the banks, the then Government did not force any lending targets on them. This Government have been trying their best to undo that damage through Merlin and other measures, but the previous Government should have got it right in the first place and have made it harder now.</p>

For all their claims about our record, such as the ones that we have just heard, the Government have kept in place some of the support measures for business that we left them on leaving office. I should point out that under Labour, 1.1 million businesses were created. When we left office, the UK was rated fourth by the World Bank for the ease of doing business, and first in Europe. Under this Government, the UK has dropped to seventh in the global rankings. We will take no lectures from the Government on support for business.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.1/4">In government, we set up the Better Regulation Executive and the Regulatory Policy Committee to improve the quality, and where appropriate reduce the quantity, of regulation on business. I note that the Government have continued with them.</p>

	<p pid="b.329.1/1">I cannot name the top five, but the whole reason the Better Regulation Executive and the Regulatory Policy Committee were set up was to reduce regulations by a huge number and improve their quality.</p>
	<p pid="b.329.1/2">In government, we also conceived the technology and innovation centres, to promote innovation. The Government are now rolling them out across the country, and they have sought to build on the measures that we put in place to reduce the bureaucracy of Government procurement and increase SMEs&#8217; access to it.</p>
	<p pid="b.329.1/3">In many other areas, however, there has been a disorderly retreat from an active approach. The Government have undermined certainty for investment, cut the science and research funding budget by 15% in real terms and abandoned the 10-year funding plan, and they have abandoned sector strategies such as the defence industrial strategy. The Automotive Council continues, but the RDAs, which could have helped make a reality of the ambition to strengthen companies&#8217; supply chains, no longer exist.</p>
	<p pid="b.329.1/4">The Government have undermined new industries, such as green industries, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40206" name="Caroline Flint">the Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase> will outline in the debate that will follow this one. They have delayed the roll-out of universal broadband and undermined the collaborative institutions that we set up to work with businesses, such as the Office for Life Sciences and the Technology Strategy Board, which are widely respected. The higher education sector, the seventh-largest export industry, has been put in disarray by the Government&#8217;s visa changes. Support for the digital, creative and educational sectors has been scaled back. Then there is the decision to award the &#163;1.5 billion contract for new Thameslink trains to a manufacturer that will make them in Germany, which means that Bombardier is reviewing its activities in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.329.1/5">The Government have retreated from action, undermined confidence, failed to unlock investment, failed to deliver a credible plan for growth and failed to use action to back business. They need to back our five-point plan for growth now and put in place a credible plan to build for our long-term success. These are difficult and challenging times for businesses and people in this country. They deserve better from a Government who say, &#8220;We are all in it together&#8221;, but who, time and again, show that they have absolutely no understanding of the concept.</p>

	<p pid="b.330.0/2">The motion makes perfectly legitimate points about the state of the economy. It is certainly true that there is slow growth across Europe and in the UK. We fully understand that. We have not had the double-dip recession that has been predicted since the very first day of this Government, but yes, we do have slow growth. We accept that we have a worrying level of youth unemployment, although the largest component of that, the NEETs&#8212;those who are not in education, employment or training&#8212;were actually at their peak level before the financial crisis occurred. It is correct to say, as the motion does, that we have a high, and we would argue excessive, level of borrowing. That makes it all the more perverse that the single policy that the hon. Gentleman is offering to us is to increase that level of borrowing, which he considers so toxic.</p>

	<p pid="b.330.6/1">Let me just finish this argument. Some of us have argued for a long time that the underlying problem is that, since the beginning of the crisis, the British economy has suffered&#8212;I use my own metaphor&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.330.6/2">the economic equivalent of a heart attack. There is a profound problem, and what lies behind it is the fact that, more than any other developed country, we have quite extraordinary levels of debt.</p>
	<p pid="b.330.6/3">There are different kinds of debt. Household debt is 160% of gross domestic product and, after the boom that took place under the previous Government, it is higher than in other developed countries. Banks&#8217; balance sheets are more than 400% of GDP, after they were allowed to run out of control. Government debt is 180% and rising as a result of the deficit financing we had to undertake. If we put those things together, as McKinsey has done, they show that the position we inherited is one where total debt in the UK is approaching 500% of our GDP. The only other country with a problem of that scale is Japan. That is the inheritance we are now seeking to manage.</p>

	<p pid="b.331.2/1">On the level of borrowing, let us wait until next week and see what the independent forecast is in the Chancellor&#8217;s statement. Of course, the reason why borrowing rises when the economy slows down is because of the flexibility that is built in&#8212;the so-called counter-cyclical stabilisers that we employ as part of our fiscal policy. Unlike the United States and other countries, we allow slow-downs to be accommodated in that way, supporting the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.331.2/2">The hon. Gentleman asked me what our strategy is to deal with this problem. I will summarise it. There are three parts. First, we have to stick to fiscal discipline to maintain the confidence of the people who lend to us. That is a very simple proposition that is very difficult to realise and it is something we have done. He quoted various comments from business organisations around the country. I keep in touch with such organisations regularly and go around the country to the regions and nations of the UK. I have yet to meet a single representative of the business community who has asked us to slacken our process of deficit reduction&#8212;not a single one. They all make it absolutely clear, including the CBI, that they regard plan A, as it is called, which is deficit reduction, as an absolutely necessary pre-condition to stabilising the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.331.2/3">The second element relates to the first. Precisely because we have a large amount of debt in our economy, the priority for Government has to be to preserve an environment in which there are low interest rates. The stimulus we get in our economy&#8212;the source of demand&#8212;comes primarily through monetary policy. Through the</p>
	<p pid="b.331.2/4">Bank of England acting on short-term interest rates, through long-term interest rates related to bond yields, through quantitative easing at the Bank of England&#8212;now credit easing&#8212;and through a competitive exchange rate, we have a monetary policy that supports growth and demand. Given the massive debt we have inherited, it is only through monetary policy&#8212;relatively low interest rates&#8212;that we can possibly support the economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.332.0/1">On that point, the Business Secretary talks about monetary policy as if it is somehow a good thing that we are having to resort to quantitative easing. Does he agree that quantitative easing is a last resort of a desperate Government?</p>

	<p pid="b.332.1/1">It is certainly a last resort in a major economic crisis. I am sure he appreciates that we are living through an economic crisis that is unparalleled in our lifetimes. That is why not only Britain, but the United States and other countries are having to resort to unorthodox monetary policy. That is a reflection of the desperation of many western countries. Our Bank of England has been comfortable with our fiscal policy and, to that extent, has been willing to support it through monetary means.</p>
	<p pid="b.332.1/2">Those are two of the three elements of the strategy. The third is rebalancing the economy. We inherited an economy that was horribly unbalanced in favour of debt-supported consumption and banking, and we are now rebalancing the economy towards exports and trade. Rapid growth is taking place at the moment in British exports. That is the strategy on which we will proceed and on which we will be judged. The alternative we have been offered is something called plan B, which I think has been renamed the &#8220;Antiques Roadshow&#8221; in respect of the shadow Chancellor. No serious business organisation is arguing that such financial irresponsibility has any prospect of success.</p>

	<p pid="b.332.3/1">I can give a bit of substance in answer to that. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which has been critical of the Government in some respects, has done its own simulation. On the use of fiscal policy to support growth, which I think is what the Opposition plan B is all about, it says that in order to stimulate growth from 1% to 2% we would need to have a Government borrowing account of about 12% of GDP. Is that actually what the Opposition are proposing because that is what their plan B&#8212;fiscal stimulus&#8212;means?</p>

	<p pid="b.333.1/1">I will describe in more detail, as will the Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning, some of the initiatives that we are taking on apprenticeships, for example, which reflect real imagination and real change.</p>
	<p pid="b.333.1/2">Let me try to respond to some of the points that the hon. Member for Streatham made. First, he wholly misunderstands what is happening with the regional growth fund. More than half the projects are under way in the first wave of the regional growth fund. The factories have been built and the jobs are being created. Because of due diligence, the disbursement&#8212;I have had this confirmed&#8212;is still taking an average of three to six weeks. I am happy to pursue the individual cases that the hon. Gentleman raised. As I understand it&#8212;I may be wrong&#8212;the case that he dwelt on at some length is the result of the applicant having radically changed the status of their application, and we will happily look at that. However, I am not going to take lectures on the disbursement of Government money. I do not know whether he is aware of this, but the previous Government set up a &#163;5 billion trade credit insurance scheme which, after two years, has managed to disburse &#163;81,000. The regional growth fund is proceeding as predicted and suggested by Lord Heseltine and his team. We are following those processes. The factories are being built and the jobs are being created, and that is what matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.333.1/3">The hon. Gentleman challenged me on procurement. I have been to Derby and talked to the people involved. Obviously, we are very concerned about what has happened in that case. The problem with procurement is that for a decade or more the public procurement policies pursued in this country were unbelievably short-sighted and legalistic. In the case of the Thameslink contract, we inherited a contract procedure based principles that did not allow for the wider effects on the British economy. However, that particular decision has been made. I have made it absolutely clear, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office made it clear two days ago, that we are going to approach public procurement in a different way. We are going to do it strategically and take account of supply chains. Of course we will operate within the law and will not be protectionist, but a lot can be done through public procurement that we are now going to pursue. My only question is why on earth Labour Members did not do this when they were in office if they care so much about it.</p>

	<p pid="b.334.0/1">No, I cannot do that, because the projects are under construction. When they are fully completed and fully staffed and their supply chains are established, it will be possible to come up with a meaningful number.</p>
	<p pid="b.334.0/2">The third area of criticism and questioning of the hon. Member for Streatham related to the banks. The motion recycles the idea of a bank bonus tax, so let us go over what that involves. The current estimate from the CBI, which has carried out research on this in the City, suggests that the yield from bonuses this year&#8212;the bonus pool&#8212;is likely to be something in the order of &#163;4.2 billion. Of that &#163;4.2 billion, &#163;2.5 billion goes to Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs in tax because of high tax rates on bonuses, and rightly so. That leaves &#163;1.7 billion in bonuses paid out, assuming that the projection is correct. The Opposition are suggesting that they will have a &#163;2 billion tax on bank bonuses. Where is this &#163;2 billion going to come from? It is considerably more than the total bonuses paid out. Even if they applied 100% tax, which is implausible, what would happen, obviously, is that pay would be consolidated. They have not thought this through. Perhaps that is why the hon. Gentleman did not bother to raise it. Can he can tell us how it will work?</p>

	<p pid="b.334.1/1">I am happy to do so. I am slightly bemused that the Secretary of State should quote those figures from the CBI. It represents all the banks, so would he expect it to say anything different? Of course, the bonus round has not yet been completed, so we have absolutely no idea what the final figure will be.</p>

	<p pid="b.334.2/1">I see that the hon. Gentleman is playing for time.</p>
	<p pid="b.334.2/2">Apart from this slightly mysterious bank bonus tax, what is extraordinary is that we are being lectured on the banking system by a party which in government allowed the banking system to run completely out of control. There was no regulation on cash bonuses. Despite the fact that the banks had an implicit Government guarantee, they were not required to pay any tax for it. We have introduced the banking levy. Labour allowed tax avoidance on an industrial scale and did absolutely nothing about it, yet the hon. Gentleman now presumes to lecture me on banking. I really do think that Labour Members need to reflect a little on what happened in the banking system.</p>
	<p pid="b.334.2/3">Finally, the hon. Gentleman made various references to spending commitments&#8212;or our damaging spending cuts, as he saw them&#8212;and tax cuts. This is the time of year when my grandchildren write letters to the north pole addressed to Santa Claus. I have to say that compared with what we are hearing, those letters from my five-year-old grandson are a model of financial discipline and economic literacy. The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s predecessor was very eloquent in criticising the cuts to the university teaching grant. The hon. Gentleman has adopted other targets&#8212;for example, he has criticised the cuts in the regional development agencies. He has also criticised cuts in the science budget. Last week, he made a very eloquent statement on this, despite the fact that the scientific establishment had been very complimentary about the fact that we had protected the cash budget for science.</p>
	<p pid="b.334.2/4">When I came into my current job, the one thing I knew was that my Labour predecessors were planning to cut the Department&#8217;s budget by 25%, and that is what we have done, because that was the economic reality. I am therefore left with a question to which I have been trying to get an answer. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman can be more forthcoming and economically rounded than his predecessor in telling me how the Opposition are going to achieve their plans. Where is the money going to come from? We have a whole lot of spending commitments in every area of our Department, but not a single suggestion about where those heroic cuts are going to come from. Of course we would like to spend more money on science and other things, and of course some of the tax cut proposals are very attractive, such as the VAT rate on building repairs, which would cost &#163;1 billion, but where does the money come from? This gets to the heart of the problem, which is that the Labour Opposition&#8217;s proposal is financially irresponsible. It deals with the problem of Government borrowing by adding to it and deals with the problem of Government debt by adding to it.</p>

	<p pid="b.335.1/1">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s numbers may have been costed but they do not add up&#8212;that is the problem. As for the banks, it will be quite some years before the sales take place. The Northern Rock sale has gone ahead&#8212;that is a small bank&#8212;but for the major banks, it is likely to be some years ahead. We do not know whether it will be in this Parliament or the next; we have no idea what the economic conditions will be. It would be ludicrous for me to hypothecate about revenue receipts at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.335.1/2">I will move on to my final passage, because I would like colleagues to have an opportunity to speak. I will summarise some of the positive things that we are doing, albeit within a very constrained budget, to support growth. Of course, fiscal discipline and monetary policy have to be supported by interventions. The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right that there is a role for state intervention. I am not in favour of laissez-faire. There are things that we can do.</p>
	<p pid="b.335.1/3">Our concentration is on export growth. There has been 13% export growth over the past year. We are outward looking. The motion does not even mention trade. It is unbelievably parochial. I spend a lot of my time in emerging markets with British exporters&#8212;I have been to all of them&#8212;to support export growth. I do not claim personal credit for the growth, but we have acted as a catalyst for export growth in Brazil, Russia, India and China&#8212;the BRIC countries&#8212;of 26%, in India of 34% and in Turkey of 30%. I keep in touch with our exporters by working with them and alongside them to deal with overseas Governments. That is where the recovery is going to take place. It is on the back of those exports that we are getting rapid growth in manufacturing in certain sectors such as the automobile sector, which has attracted big inward investment from Jaguar Land Rover and others.</p>

	<p pid="b.336.1/1">UKTI has been radically reformed, thanks to the Minister for Trade and Investment, Lord Green. I think that it will perform an excellent function. What I found was that British export activity in the big emerging markets, which is clearly where future growth lies, had been sorely neglected for many years. As somebody put it to me, when we turned up on the beach the Germans were already in the deckchairs. They have dominated the market in these countries and we are a marginal player.

	<p pid="b.336.3/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for reminding me of one of my best lines. It is partly a compliment to Ireland that we trade with it so extensively, but that fact is an appalling commentary on our neglect of the big emerging markets.</p>
	<p pid="b.336.3/2">Export growth is one key focus for us. The second is people and apprenticeships. The Minister for Further Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning will say more about this in his summary. Despite a severely curtailed budget, we have increased apprenticeships&#8212;actual people doing training&#8212;by 50% over the past year. There are now 350,000 people in such training. We do not accept that that is the end of the road. We have to improve the quality and refocus as much as possible on younger apprentices, thereby addressing in part the problem of youth unemployment. This is a major success story and we are proud of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.336.3/3">On access to finance, one of the major themes of my analysis has been that what we are dealing with is a collapsed and non-functioning banking system. It is right for Members to continue to cross-question us on the Merlin agreement, because that is at the heart of the problem. We have stopped, at least in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises, a process of rapid deleveraging. We are using Government funding through the regional growth fund and, from next year, the Green investment bank to co-finance private capital so that there is access to finance for British industry. We are taking initiatives to support equity finance. The business growth fund is not Government owned or controlled, but it is a major initiative that should have been taken decades ago to get equity finance functioning. Access to finance is a critical issue&#8212;of course we accept that. It is a consequence of the banking crisis that we are focused on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.336.3/4">I want to give one final concluding thought. When I hear the Opposition speaking about the economy, I think that lying at the back of their world view is the idea that what we are currently in the middle of is a cyclical problem&#8212;we had a boom, we had a bust, we will press a few buttons, spend a bit more money, and we will get back into a boom again. This is not a cyclical problem; it is a profound, long-standing structural problem. We had the wrong model. Growth was based on</p>
	<p pid="b.336.3/5">fundamentally the wrong principles, it was not sustainable and it collapsed. We are now having to repair the damage.</p>

	<p pid="b.337.2/1">I will bear in mind your comments, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.337.2/2">The problem in a debate like this is where to start. I will start with what I want to see, which is business growth. Business growth delivers job creation, which in turn delivers tax revenues and growth for individuals, the importance of which we should not underestimate at any cost. The fundamental question that we are discussing is whether Opposition and Government Members believe that the Government can be a driver for growth. I and a number of my colleagues believe that they can be.</p>
	<p pid="b.337.2/3">Why is this debate so important? It is important to my constituents because people in my constituency are losing jobs, and businesses in my constituency are going bust. The industry that I have been involved in since I was 18 years of age has been decimated by the Government. In Ochil and South Perthshire, 5.6 jobseeker&#8217;s allowance claimants are going after each job. I realise that that is by no means the highest rate in the UK. The number of JSA claimants in Ochil and South Perthshire has risen by 95% since 2006. The overall number of people in employment is falling. In the last year, 93% of constituencies saw a rise in their claimant count. That has been caused by the speed and depth of the cuts, and by the private sector not being able to keep up with them, just as the Opposition said would happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.337.2/4">That is why we want the Government to do more to help UK businesses. Helping business helps employment. The Government have cut capital budgets by 11%. Because their deficit reduction plan is failing, they will have to borrow more to pay for unemployment and to cover falling tax revenues. That is the backdrop that has led to this debate. The Government should listen hard to what is said by my colleagues on the Labour Benches.</p>
	<p pid="b.337.2/5">As I said, I have been in the construction industry all my life. I remain involved in that business today. In the time that I have left, I will talk about what the Government can do and should be doing to help the construction industry. It is my view that the construction industry gives a measure of the economy as a whole. It is of the private sector, but it needs the public sector and the private sector to survive. If businesses want to expand, they need the construction industry to do so if they need premises, transport networks or communication infrastructure. If the construction industry is on its knees, the country is on its knees. The Government need to grasp the fact that every pound spent in the construction industry generates &#163;2.83 in the wider economy. That point is not disputed.</p>
	<p pid="b.337.2/6">The Opposition&#8217;s five-point plan would benefit the construction industry from point one through to point five. I will focus on one or two of the points in the short time that I have left. Bringing forward investment projects</p>
	<p pid="b.337.2/7">to get the industry working again would regenerate our infrastructure, allow future growth and give skills to individuals.</p>

	<p pid="b.338.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. If we do not get our infrastructure right, we will not be in the position that we want to be in when things move forward and we will be disadvantaged.

We need local and regional regeneration and investment in local and regional infrastructure.</p>

	<p pid="b.338.3/1">My experience of the Work programme is that it is a not-working programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.3/2">The cut in VAT to 5% for home improvement repairs and maintenance&#8212;another part of Labour&#8217;s five-point plan&#8212;would discourage the black market and encourage investment in our housing stock at a time when the Government are wringing their hands about the green deal. Experian data show that a cut from 17.5% to 5% would have produced a &#163;1.4 billion stimulus to the UK economy in 2010, which would have got Britain building. It is working on reviewing that figure in the light of the current 20% VAT rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.3/3">On housing, which is an important part of the construction industry, social rent starts and affordable home starts have fallen by 99%, but in 2007, there were 357,000 first-time home buyers in the UK, who generated &#163;2.1 billion in our high streets. That is the real power of the construction industry and why the industry is so important to the whole of the UK. I hope the Government plans announced earlier this week to regenerate the housing market deliver progress, but one must ask: why have they been asleep at the wheel for the past 18 months?</p>
	<p pid="b.338.3/4">On lending, we are a country of small businesses, yet the Federation of Small Businesses tells us that credit lines for financially sound businesses have been tightened and interest rates have increased. The Federation of Master Builders has reinforced the point about that failure.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.3/5">The Government have announced a desire to look at credit easing, which suggests that Project Merlin has failed. Do they know how much of Project Merlin&#8217;s compliance agreements are re-signed and recycled arrangements? Do they know that banks are withdrawing overdraft facilities and setting businesses up with term loans?</p>

	<p pid="b.339.0/1">The hon. Gentleman echoes the shadow Secretary of State in criticising the Government for undertaking quantitative easing. In truth, this Government and the previous one undertook quantitative easing, but there is a huge difference between them. This Government are using QE to buy bank debt to put liquidity into the banks, which is much needed by business, whereas the previous one used QE to buy Government debt, because at the time, the rest of the world had lost confidence in buying it.</p>

	<p pid="b.339.1/1">I never mentioned quantitative easing&#8212;I was talking about term loans.

Business should not be run on term loans.</p>

Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> on introducing this debate and on the thoughtful way in which he presented his case. As I said in an intervention, he offers an opportunity for a fresh approach. What a contrast this debate is to the one on the economy called by his colleague the shadow Chancellor a couple of weeks ago, which turned into an episode of &#8220;Romper Room&#8221;&#8212;some hon. Members are old enough to remember that&#8212;with childish comments being made left, right and centre. The hon. Member for Streatham presented a much more cogent case today, but that is the root of his problem. He is the fresh new hope, but unfortunately he is held back by sad and discredited ideas, the core policy of which, as the Prime Minister has said, has been reheated and resold at least eight times already.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.2/3">I encourage the hon. Member for Streatham to be a little bolder in setting out his ideas. I know that he agrees&#8212;his speech lasted 31 minutes, but only in the 30th did he get round to talking about Labour&#8217;s so-called five-point plan. I ask him to spend more time developing his ideas, and not to be held back by the discredited Labour past.</p>

	<p pid="b.339.4/1">I appreciate that, and I shall continue to listen intently to all the hon. Gentleman says.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.4/2">The challenge that this country faces to restore growth is immense. It needs good ideas from both sides of the House and full commitment to the task. On that point, may I say gently to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, who is a noble individual and a good gentleman, that sometimes people feel that that commitment may not be there 100% of the time from the Department, and that is a commitment to the role of the free market and business.</p>
	<p pid="b.339.4/3">It is as though we have at times a literary equivalent of Dr Cable and Mr Hyde. There is one part of the personality of the Secretary of State that embraces the idea of business and likes the approach of free markets, and then there is the other side of the personality that likes to hang out with a bunch of people on a camping holiday outside a well-known church musing on the merits of capitalism.</p>

	<p pid="b.340.0/1">Just to correct my hon. Friend slightly, this Government have done more than the previous Government did in 13 years on deregulation and freeing up British business. We must not lose sight of that.</p>

	<p pid="b.340.1/1">That is absolutely true, but the challenge that we face is more immense because of 13 years of over-regulation by the previous Government, and because of the challenge of the international community. From the Secretary of State&#8217;s announcements today, I know that the sunshine side of his personality is more to the fore, and that he will demonstrate a strong and full commitment to the hard work that entrepreneurs and business leaders are putting in around the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.340.1/2">I encourage the Secretary of State to take action on three further areas. First, I encourage him to work more strongly with the Treasury on ideas for credit that work for all sizes of businesses. Although there is a lot of emphasis on trying to make the banks a useful conduit of finance to small businesses, that is not working for very small businesses. Please can we look at alternative measures? Can we look again at tax relief for debt financing for our micro-businesses? For the first time, can we consider peer-to-peer lending organisations such as Funding Circle, which provides an alternative way of raising funds for small businesses? It is not enough to come forward with another policy that relies on the banks doing something tomorrow that they are not doing today.</p>
	<p pid="b.340.1/3">Secondly, I encourage the Secretary of State to look at the sector that is the biggest drag on our economy, namely the bureaucratic state. If we want to create a growing economy, we cannot ignore such a substantial part of it. I encourage him to ask other Ministers to enlist our public servants and bureaucrats in the task of identifying growth. Every single day, the employees of small businesses in my constituency work very hard to create growth and the conditions for profitability, and they tell me that they are not getting the support they need from either their local government or their national Government. We need a culture change in our Government Departments. They need to say: &#8220;Our primary task&#8212;our national mission&#8212;is to support the growth of enterprise and business. What can we do every day to help people to achieve that?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.340.1/4">Will the Secretary of State also look at the opportunity provided by social enterprises? The Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40511" name="Nick Hurd">the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd)</phrase>, who is the Minister with responsibility for the civil society, is doing a lot of work with social enterprises to free them from some of the burdens of regulation. Will the Secretary of State have his Department look at how the power of social entrepreneurs can be brought to bear on our public services and public sector so that they can be more productive? Social enterprises are a fantastic way to encourage growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.340.1/5">Will the Secretary of State consider using Parliament to review outdated statutory instruments, laws and regulations that are a bureaucratic drag on productivity and business? Rather than using Parliament to pass new laws, we could use it to scrap existing ones. I am sure we can find time for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.340.1/6">Thirdly and finally&#8212;this underlies all our efforts to create growth&#8212;I benefited in my career from two fundamental pushes on growth in our economy: building out the global supply chain and the consequential growth of financial services, which gave people the ability to buy goods and services much more cheaply than they would have got them had we relied only on a national economy; and the growth of information technology. The next source of fantastic growth is likely to be when households in India and China want to buy our goods. But that is not here today. That is not going to be here in the next five years. What we can do in that period of time is have a national campaign led by the Secretary of State to create an entrepreneurial society recognising that there are different motivations for being an entrepreneur. Not only do entrepreneurs want to make money; people are motivated by spiritual objectives. Let that be the mission and legacy of our Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="b.341.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow the thoughtful speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the hon. Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase>. He and I have a common interest in the supply chains that he ended his comments talking about. The Secretary of State knows that I have been working hard in the north-west region to improve the automotive supply chain. That is one of the solutions because we are now in a position to recapture work from countries to which work in the automotive sector was previously exported as a result of changes in those countries&#8217; economies. As labour costs have risen, as they will continue to do inexorably in Poland and China for example, we will be able to start thinking about recapturing that work. There needs to be common ground there.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.0/2">I want to correct one point: for the second time, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40534" name="Julian Smith">the hon.

I think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40537" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase> will back me up on this point because she attended the Regulatory Reform Committee assiduously when I was its Chair: we could count on one hand the number of times a Conservative Member turned up to the Committee in the last Parliament.

	<p pid="b.341.2/1">That was certainly the case with the Regulatory Reform Committee&#8212;it used the framework of the House to make limited adjustments&#8212;but we should remember the legacy left by Sir William Sargent, who did an amazing amount of work leading the Better Regulation Executive and putting in place the framework now being utilised. To ignore his work would be an insult to a fine public servant.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.2/2">On skills, I am pleased that the apprentice Minister or the Minister for apprenticeships&#8212;whichever way it is&#8212;is here. I understand that he has indicated his wish to visit West Cheshire college. He is most welcome to visit that fine college built with resources provided by Labour but I would like him to think about some issues, particularly the needs of apprentices and young people</p>
	<p pid="b.341.2/3">coming to train from areas of extreme deprivation. There are many simple things that he could urge the Treasury to think about. For example, in my area there are plenty of vocational courses leading to jobs in specialist sectors, yet young people from deprived areas who, had they stayed on at school, would have got free school meals get no support to help them eat when at college.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.2/4">TTE training runs a good training centre in my constituency providing Cogent training courses&#8212;I recently had the great pleasure to attend the royal visit to the centre organised at the behest of the royal family. That training centre is doing fantastic work at the high end of the petrochemicals sector&#8212;with players such as Shell and Ineos Chlor&#8212;but it is having difficulty finding a financial solution to deal with the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises. The Secretary of State will know that in Germany the burden is often placed on the large players, which are encouraged to finance the supply chain. That is one possible solution but the important point is that we need a practical solution, otherwise we will have no way forward and the young people making themselves available to go on such courses will be&#8212;</p>

However, there is a fair amount of agreement between him and me on this point so I ask him not to tempt me down that line.</p>
	<p pid="b.342.1/2">Mention has been made of the serious issue of the science base. The Secretary of State has got to get to grips with the confusion in the university sector. A combination of things has impacted on the universities, such as the fees structure changes, the capital spend problems and the overseas student issue. Yes, it is welcome that millions of pounds are being spent on a graphene centre in Manchester, but would it not have been ironic that had these rules been in place, Andre Geim might not have been at Manchester university to make those fantastic discoveries? The Government have to think carefully about the possibility of damaging a &#163;5 billion industry that provides us not only with a superb base for our own research and development and science-based companies, but with a huge export of knowledge, which improves our relationship with so many of the countries with which we do business. I urge the Government to rethink what they are doing in the university sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.342.2/2">business in this country needs support, and we all want it to get that support. On the economy, however, that is probably where the consensus ends. The coalition Government cannot abandon their plans and adopt the seductive mantra of going less far, less fast. The consequences of doing that can be seen across the channel in Greece, Portugal and Spain, which have borrowing rates of 32%, 11% and 7% respectively, compared with Germany&#8217;s 1.82%, France&#8217;s 3.12% and the UK&#8217;s 2.28%.</p>

	<p pid="b.343.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, and he is absolutely right to say that there is more borrowing than we had anticipated. However, the amount of borrowing will be going down year on year. I am sure that my colleagues on the Front Bench would agree with me that we cannot get out of a debt crisis by borrowing more. At some stage we have to start actually paying the money back. The UK is borrowing at low rates&#8212;we have that confidence.

	<p pid="b.343.1/4">However, it is not true that we have failed in that respect. We have cut corporation tax, and by the end of this Parliament we aim to create the most competitive corporate tax system in the G20. Research and development credits will rise by 200% this year and 225% next year. Then there is regulation. We have scrapped the proposals that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40244" name="Andrew Miller">the hon. Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller)</phrase> was talking about, with savings to business currently amounting to &#163;350 million a year. Whatever we did in our little Committee, it never amounted to that sort of saving. We have also introduced a moratorium on new regulation for micro-businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.1/5">Then there is technology and innovation centres, and so on&#8212;I do not have time to say much more in five minutes.</p>

	<p pid="b.343.2/1">The exemption for micro-businesses is a key development from this Government. Does my hon. Friend think that some of the arrogance of Opposition Members comes from their never having worked in a small business, and that that absence of business experience is influencing their views?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.344.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40537" speakername="Lorely Burt" colnum="344"  time="015:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0002.htm#11112385003521">
	<p pid="b.344.0/1">I would not dream of criticising Opposition Members. I know that quite a number of them have run their own businesses&#8212;micro-businesses and bigger businesses, too&#8212;but I also give our Government credit for coming up with that exemption, because it is an important source of help at a difficult time.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.0/2">Finance has been a big issue. We have not got it right yet: there is more lending, but we still need to do more. We have continued the enterprise finance guarantee scheme and the programme of enterprise capital funds. We are also encouraging a more enabling environment for business angel investment, taking forward a package of investment readiness through a network of growth hubs. Then there is the bank-led &#163;1.5 billion business growth fund, to provide funding of &#163;2 million to &#163;10 million for small and medium-sized businesses with strong growth potential. What is more, as I am sure even the Opposition would concede, we have not failed to use strategic tools to bring forward growth. Indeed, a number of those strategic moves are ones that Labour introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.0/3">After the knockabout we come to the constructive part of the motion, which is very welcome; indeed, I agree with some of it. However, the plan to levy a &#163;2 billion tax on bank bonuses&#8212;this week it is to fund 100,000 jobs for young people and 25,000 more affordable homes&#8212;is a nice idea, but as my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, it is just not practical. We are already taxing banks every year to the tune of &#163;2.5 billion, on the basis of the banks&#8217; balance sheets. That is more than the Labour party raised with its &#163;2 billion bankers&#8217; bonus tax&#8212;a move that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase> has already admitted has &#8220;failed&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.0/4">Opposition colleagues also suggest reversing the VAT rise for a temporary period. That is great, but how are they going to pay for it? What other cuts will they make instead? Is this part of their slowdown programme&#8212;their &#8220;not too far, not too fast&#8221; agenda, which has so spectacularly failed in America, whose credit rating has been downgraded and whose debt is now $15 trillion? The motion calls on us</p>
	<p pid="b.344.0/5">&#8220;to bring forward long-term&#8230;projects to get people back to work&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.0/6">I totally agree with that&#8212;who would not?&#8212;and I hope to see more strategies that complement the things that we are already doing, such as the Green investment bank, the green deal, house building, the growing places fund, and so on. I would also like the council house building programme to be brought forward before we receive the receipts from the sale of 100,000 council houses. Why wait? Let us build those houses now.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.0/7">I also agree with the suggestion of a one-year cut in VAT on home improvements, repairs and maintenance. The Treasury is losing many millions of pounds in revenue because of a growing black market involving private customers and small businesses paying cash for jobs done in their homes. The one-year national insurance tax break to help small businesses grow and create jobs is a great idea&#8212;one for which I have lobbied for some time. However, as a start, and to make it more affordable, why not introduce it for small businesses? I would greatly like to see&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.345.0/1">It is easy to launch into a debate about the macro policy, but we all represent individual businesses. The most frustrating thing for our electors, whatever seat we represent, is the gap between Government policy and rhetoric, and the reality on the ground. I would like to use three businesses in my constituency to illustrate the way in which Government policy is damaging growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/2">The first businessman, who should remain anonymous, is a local plumber, known to Members in all parts of the House because he has replaced many MPs&#8217; bathrooms. He faces a dilemma because of the increase in VAT to 20%. After 40 years in the industry, he tells me that the increase has become a psychological barrier for many customers, as they are immediately able to work out the amounts involved. People understand what they are paying much more than they do when the rate is 15% or 17.5%. He is afraid that the VAT increase is a double whammy for the economy. First, there will be more VAT avoidance and the tax take will fall, thereby making it harder to reduce the deficit. Secondly, the increase will lead to people not doing jobs around their homes, which will stifle economic growth. The Opposition have said that we want to reverse the VAT rise and have a one-year cut to 5% on home improvements. I strongly believe that we should analyse the impact of the VAT increase on small businesses, in the long-term financial interests of the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/3">The second concern is about banks&#8217; lending policies. Terry Withers, of Admiral Scaffolding, a company of 20 years standing, says that Government-backed RBS refused to let the business go overdrawn by just &#163;5,000, even though it was the first time he had ever asked for an overdraft and the business had uncleared cheques going through its account worth &#163;26,000. The company was also refused a loan that would have seen it convert all its vehicles to the latest green technology and expand its scaffolding kit, which in turn would have allowed it to increase the number of people it employs from 100 to 140. Mr Withers says that he is exactly the sort of business man who has lost out because of the failure of the Government&#8217;s Project Merlin.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/4">In the first three quarters of the year, over half the SMEs applying for an overdraft for the first time were refused. A few months ago, when I took up the case of another business in a similar position, the Merton chamber of commerce told me that local firms were pessimistic about the future because of constraints on their working capital and the difficulty of raising finances. No wonder the CBI has found that almost two thirds of business leaders are considering changing their work force plans. The truth is that, so far, the Government have been unable to make the banks lend&#8212;that includes even our own banks, such as RBS&#8212;and when the banks refuse, direct Government help is pitiful.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/5">My third case concerns Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. I would like to take this opportunity to voice my anger about its disgraceful attitude when dealing with MPs&#8217; casework. I have always had difficulties in dealing with HMRC. In the most recent case, which was brought to my attention by Simon Walker of SPS Timber, a window manufacturer and replacement company in my constituency, I wrote to HMRC in August. It wrote back nearly four weeks later to say that it hoped to reply to me by November. Then when the reply came</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/6">it was full of inaccuracies. The issue concerned HMRC&#8217;s penalties for late cheques for payroll. Mr Walker says that HMRC had not told him of the penalties. He argues that those penalties are a false economy, as they could be the breaking point for some small firms.</p>
	<p pid="b.345.0/7">HMRC&#8217;s reply described a letter allegedly sent to Mr Walker in May, even though Mr Walker says that he keeps all his correspondence and has received nothing. My visit to his business showed him to be an assiduous record-keeper. HMRC admits to not having any record of the letter it sent him. HMRC claims that it spoke to a &#8220;Catherine Walker&#8221; about this in October, but nobody of that name works for the company, and in any case this was months after the penalties were charged. My telephone conversations have been just as infuriating. I am sure I am not the only Member who finds HMRC utterly unsatisfactory.</p>

We know that the Government might be trying to a certain extent, but what they are doing is not good enough and it is not working.

	<p pid="b.346.4/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak in this important debate. There is no doubt that growth and employment should be at the top of everyone&#8217;s list of priorities, and I know that that applies to this Government, who are trying to promote that agenda. This motion, however, does nothing to build on that. It is just more of the same from the Labour party&#8212;the party that brought us to the brink of bankruptcy. <i>[Interruption.] </i>It is the party that just loves to spend other people's money.</p>

	<p pid="b.347.0/2">As I was saying, the Labour party just loves to spend other people&#8217;s money. We all like to spend money: it give us that warm glow inside, but I imagine that the rate at which Labour has spent money, and wants to spend it again, would give a white-hot glow.

	<p pid="b.347.2/1">I could not agree with my hon. Friend more. That is another problem that we have to sort out by clearing up the mess left by the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.347.2/2">Despite what Labour Members say and despite the sentiment behind this motion, we are, I believe, making good progress. As we have heard, we are creating the most competitive tax system in the G20; we are investing in businesses to help them start up and grow; we are encouraging inward investment and supporting exports; we are investing in science and technology and creating a more educated and more flexible work force. Of course there is still more to do, and I believe we are doing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.347.2/3">For example, today, my right hon.

Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase>&#8212;as part of the Government&#8217;s plan for growth, which will cut unnecessary demands on business while safeguarding workers&#8217; rights. However, if we listen to the instant reaction from Labour, we find that they would have us believe that these measures are anti-employment and the reforms are about making it easier for companies to fire staff. I believe that the reverse is true. The Opposition spend a lot of time trying to cast employers as the bad guys&#8212;as a group of money grabbers trying to get rich off the backs of the workers.</p>

	<p pid="b.347.4/1">I would indeed agree with that view. I believe that all Government Members, and I suspect some Opposition Members too, would agree that the vast majority of businesses, especially small</p>
	<p pid="b.347.4/2">and medium-sized enterprises, know that their most valuable asset is their staff. Employers need staff and staff need employers. The problem has been that in the current economic climate firms are cautious about taking on additional risk, and that often means being cautious about taking on additional staff. I believe that making it easier for companies to manage their staff levels makes it easier for them to take on staff. Knowing that the risks of employment have been reduced might well unlock the employment door.</p>

	<p pid="b.348.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that one of the worst things for an employer, particularly a small business, is having staff who are unsettled, looking for other jobs and fearful for their own future, which is actually bad both for the business and the economy, because those people spend less money? The measures proposed by the Government will simply contribute further to that, and make the situation worse.</p>

	<p pid="b.348.1/1">I agree that having an unsettled work force is not healthy, which is why it falls to business men to reassure their staff.

	<p pid="b.348.3/1">No I will not, I am afraid.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.3/2">Responsible businesses have, and recognise that they have, a duty of care towards their employees and will often put their welfare before their own. They will not take decisions that would destabilise an existing business. As someone who has run my own business&#8212;and, unfortunately, had to let staff go&#8212;I know how difficult those decisions are to take and how painful they can be on both sides of the divide. Businesses do not want to take risks with the livelihood of those whom they already employ, so they may not hire additional staff unless absolutely they are sure that they are needed and affordable. Trying to downscale later could be costly and time-consuming, so they avoid the risk.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.3/3">The proposals announced today might well help employers to make the decision to hire earlier, thus stimulating employment and growth, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises. If each one were to employ one additional member of staff, we would have an employment deficit. This will build on what has already been achieved in the last 18 months, with 500,000 new private sector jobs, more than 500,000 new businesses created, the manufacturing sector growing and our credit rating restored.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.3/4">Labour Members would have us believe that they left us with some golden economic legacy, but nothing could be further from the truth. In the 13 years they were in power unemployment rose, workless households rose, and households where no one had ever worked more than doubled. Unfortunately, we also saw youth unemployment, which we all accept is a problem when it has risen to nearly 1 million. That is why I welcome the measures that the Government have brought forward, particularly in my own constituency, which has seen the number of apprenticeship places rise this year from 560 to 740.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.3/5">The Opposition&#8217;s plan B is not credible. It just means spending more money that we do not have, because they have spent it all. It means borrowing more, and hang the consequences. It means saying, &#8220;Hide the bills, stop opening the post, don&#8217;t answer the door.&#8221; Well, that will not work. When you are in a hole you must stop digging, but we are trying to climb out of the hole that we are in. The Opposition&#8217;s solution means doing the equivalent of going to a payday lender to borrow and spend your way out of trouble. We all know what happens when people do that: they lose their credit rating, and that is a really serious problem which could cost this country many billions of pounds that it does not have.</p>

	<p pid="b.349.0/1">The audacity and complacency of Government Members is truly extraordinary, given the present state of the economy. The headline figures for UK economic growth are deeply worrying. Growth is flatlining, and it is becoming increasingly obvious to anyone with any sense that the Government&#8217;s decision to cut too far and too fast is choking it off. We also know that growth began to stall before the effect of the eurozone crisis kicked in, and that even now the full impact of that crisis has not yet been felt.</p>

	<p pid="b.349.1/1">The figures show that consumer and business confidence began to decline when the coalition Government were formed, at the time when the Prime Minister started talking about Britain being bankrupt. Was not the Prime Minister very unwise to make such comments?</p>

	<p pid="b.349.2/1">Indeed. We also know that as a consequence of Government policies&#8212;and according to independent forecasts&#8212;it is very likely that borrowing will have to increase. That is having devastating consequences. Unemployment is rising, particularly among the young, although women are also being disproportionately affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.349.2/2">The headline figures should concern us, but what should also trouble us greatly is the uneven way in which the consequences of the Government&#8217;s disastrous economic policies are being felt across the country. Once again the north-east seems to be bearing the brunt of the Conservatives&#8217; economic policies, but this time&#8212;and I hope that this point is not lost on the voters of the north-east&#8212;they have the collusion of the Liberal Democrats.</p>
	<p pid="b.349.2/3">The current unemployment rate is 11.6% in the north-east, but only 6.3% in the south-east. Similarly, the claimant count is highest in the north-east and lowest in the south-east. As I have said, the situation is even worse for young people. In the north-east, unemployment among young people increased by 106.3% between January and October 2011, prompting real fears that the region would return to the economic dark times of the 1980s. Yet this dire situation is so unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.349.2/4">Contrary to what the Secretary of State said&#8212;it is unfortunate that he is not present, because I wanted him to hear this&#8212;in the north-east gross value added actually grew between 1989 and 2008, as did GVA per head of population. That was primarily because money channelled through the regional development agency</p>
	<p pid="b.349.2/5">One North East levered in &#163;9 for every pound spent&#8212;much more than the national average&#8212;and skills levels also improved year on year.</p>

	<p pid="b.350.3/1">I am sorry; I am running out of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.3/2">We know that the RDA helped to invest in a new generation of advanced technologies with expanding markets around the world, which greatly helped growth in the north-east. Through industry, Government and university collaborations, a number of sectors were identified in which growth should be prioritised, including the processing and chemical industries, automotive and advanced manufacturing, and printable electronics. Those sectors, critically, were underpinned by centres of excellence supported by the regional development agency.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.3/3">Did the incoming Government seek to build on that? No. What they did instead was get rid of One North East, although it had extensive support from businesses and the community in the north-east, and what we have in its place is the regional growth fund, about which I shall say more in a moment. The loss of the regional development agency led to a loss of expertise in regard to the sectors that needed to be developed in the north-east, and a loss of what was necessary to support that development. In great contrast, the regional growth fund not only has less money but is not strategic at all. I am very pleased that a number of north-east companies have benefited from the RGF, although the Secretary of State must address the fact that getting the money through to the companies is taking a long time.</p>

	<p pid="b.350.5/1">No; I am sorry, but I am running out of time.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.5/2">The RGF along with local enterprise partnerships and enterprise zones do not by any stretch of the imagination add up to an economic policy for growth for the north-east, or for anywhere else for that matter, because they are fragmented initiatives with no local coherence. The RGF will not help to narrow the north-south divide, either. As I have acknowledged, a number of companies in the north-east have benefited from the RGF, and according to the Government&#8217;s own figures that will secure about 8,500 jobs, but in the same RGF round money went to the south-east to secure 30,000 jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.5/3">The north-east&#8217;s problems are compounded by the fact that the RGF money is not a sufficient injection to the private sector to enable it to make up for the jobs that are being lost in the public sector. To put the figure of 8,500 jobs in context, last month alone</p>
	<p pid="b.350.5/4">unemployment in the north-east rose by 19,000. The Government must do more, therefore. In the past couple of weeks a number of independent commentators, including the North East chamber of commerce and PricewaterhouseCoopers, have said that the Government need to do more to support private sector development in the north-east, and our five-point plan for growth sets out a clear way for them to start supporting the economy.</p>

	<p pid="b.351.0/1">I am grateful to have the opportunity to bring a Welsh perspective to this debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">The hon. Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase> is no longer in his place, but I must say that his speech was much more coherent than the Opposition&#8217;s motion.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.0/2">When considering economic growth across the entire United Kingdom, it is important to remember that there is a Labour Government in Wales, and we can compare and contrast what is happening in Wales with the positive steps the coalition Government are taking in supporting enterprise and private sector growth. Businesses in Wales are crying out for the enterprise zone idea to be implemented in Wales, yet we are still awaiting a coherent announcement from the Welsh Assembly. We in Wales have a Labour Minister for enterprise and the economy who has stated that she regrets capitalism. It is therefore no surprise that the Institute of Directors and other organisations have stated they feel that there is no partnership with the Labour Assembly Government and that Labour rejects, rather than embraces, the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.351.1/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not understand that there is a symbiotic relationship between the public and private sectors? If we cut one, the other bleeds. What is needed at present is a transfusion for the private sector, which is part of Labour&#8217;s five-point plan.</p>

	<p pid="b.351.2/1">If what we are seeing in Wales is an example of Labour economic thinking, I am very pleased that it is in opposition in the rest of the United Kingdom. The truth of the matter is that the Labour party in Wales has shown across the generations a failure to understand the importance of supporting enterprise.</p>

	<p pid="b.351.4/1">Not at the moment, as I wish to finish the point I am making. The valley communities in Wales have suffered extremely badly not just for 10 or 15 years, but over a period of 30, 40 and 50 years, and it is fair to point out that throughout that entire time they have, unfortunately, been electing Labour councillors, Labour MPs and Labour Assembly Members. There was a fantastic business support programme in the south Wales valleys called the heads of the valleys innovation programme. It was such a good programme that in 2010 it won the award for the most successful enterprise support programme in the entire United Kingdom. What did the Labour Administration in Cardiff do? They cut its funding, and that was the end of an organisation that had supported hundreds of businesses and protected more than 4,000 jobs in some of the most</p>
	<p pid="b.351.4/2">deprived communities in the United Kingdom. It was cut because it was supporting private enterprise, which the Labour party does not understand or embrace.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.4/3">Despite the fact that the motion, in general, is incoherent, I want to follow up a few points. In my constituency, we are extremely dependent on tourism, which is a major driver of growth in north Wales. It is imperative, in my view, that that sector is supported. I should point out that under pressure the Welsh Assembly has finally acknowledged that the sector deserves support, but initially the Welsh Assembly Government stated that tourism deserved no support whatsoever.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.4/4">My concern about tourism is that as a coalition Government we stress the need to create a competitive tax regime for our businesses but in Europe other countries are significantly reducing VAT on tourism. It is important that we have a level playing field and I ask the Secretary of State to consider discussing the issue with the Treasury to ensure that tourism in Wales can benefit from similar VAT rates to those in other parts of Europe, including Ireland and France. There are reports to which I have access that state that the multiplier effect of making such cuts would be financially beneficial to the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.4/5">The other issue that is imperative for growth in the economy is support for small businesses. It is all very well to say that there will be a cut in the corporation tax rate, but most of the new start-up businesses that are creating real employment in my constituency will be sole traders and partnerships. Obviously, they will benefit from the increase in personal allowances, but a key issue that creates a problem for them is the VAT registration threshold. Nobody denies that the UK has a very high VAT registration threshold at &#163;73,000, but that is not my complaint. As businesses grow and start to reach the threshold, they find themselves on a cliff edge. If they go over that level, they have to register for VAT and lose a significant part of their profitability. We need to reconsider the VAT threshold to support small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.4/6">I understand that we are running out of time in the debate, so I shall leave that issue with the Secretary of State. To support small businesses in my constituency, we need to consider the VAT threshold and how it interacts with profitability.</p>

	<p pid="b.352.0/1">I thank all those who have participated in today&#8217;s debate. On this side, we heard sparkling presentations from my hon. Friends the Members for Ochil and South Perthshire (Gordon Banks), for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), for Mitcham and Morden (Siobhain McDonagh) and for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods). We heard interesting contributions from Members on the other side of the House, too, including a speech from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40537" name="Lorely Burt">the hon. Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt)</phrase>, who appears to give our five-point plan two out of five, and a particularly stimulating speech from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the hon. Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase>&#8212;I do not think, however, that it will put him on the Secretary of State&#8217;s Christmas card list.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/2">It is clear that for businesses, councils and communities across England, this has been a wasted and frustrated year for growth in England&#8217;s regions under the Department&#8217;s watch. It has been a wasted and frustrated year for the</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/3">entrepreneurs and communities who have found their ability to grow and innovate stifled through the Department&#8217;s inability to present a coherent framework for growth or to stand up for their interests against other Government Departments. In all three key areas that are vital to growth&#8212;supporting the local enterprise partnerships, making the regional growth fund work properly and securing regeneration funding from Europe&#8212;the Department has been weighed in the balance and found wanting. Time and again, the Department has failed to be the Department for growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/4">As long ago as last September, the Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk)</phrase>, felt the need to write to the Secretary of State to warn of the icebergs ahead. He listed the organisations that were anxious about the way the LEPs were being set up and the failure to make them more sufficiently business-orientated and he ended by warning that</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/5">&#8220;the danger is that the CBI and others become detached from this policy heralding likely failure in large parts of England&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/6">Who can forget that the Secretary of State himself famously described the process as Maoist and chaotic, while the former CBI director general, Richard Lambert, simply confined himself to saying that it was a shambles?</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/7">That should come as no surprise given that in June 2010 the Secretary of State went to the Northwest RDA, praised the work that it and other agencies had done and gave them assurances, only to have to confirm their abolition two weeks later after he lost the argument with the Chancellor, who wanted them axed. It was an early example of the loss of authority and dismemberment of decision making that his Department has endured ever since. BIS Ministers allowed a decade&#8217;s worth of expertise and local know-how to be lost almost overnight. Experienced RDA staff were let go before the LEPs were up and running and at the very time when they could have provided crucial assistance.</p>
	<p pid="b.352.0/8">No wonder that even the Government&#8217;s growth tsar, Lord Heseltine, who heads up the regional growth fund, has come out and said that their hasty abolition of RDAs was a mistake. Not the least of the errors was the fact that this swept away all the informal architecture and channels of connection between business, further education, higher education and small employers that had been built up to boost growth in the English regions. We saw the cost of their hasty abolition when Pfizer announced the closure of its Sandwich plant in February. The South East England Development Agency had previously been able to act swiftly with a task force to help those affected to find jobs, but this time the Government failed to use that RDA even though it still had some people in post who could have given advice.</p>

	<p pid="b.353.1/1">No, I will not because there is not time.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/2">The Government failed to put Sandwich in the initial list of enterprise zones or to approve any of Kent&#8217;s first-round RGF bids. We saw the same pattern of help being denied initially and then an enterprise zone being hastily cobbled together when disaster struck at Derby with Bombardier and with BAE at Warton and Samlesbury. The Department is behind the curve and out of touch with events on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/3">Back in February, the Labour Front-Bench team made six proposals to support LEPs, such as giving them first refusal on assets, providing them with start-up funding, giving them powers over skills funding, allowing them to form larger groups for infrastructure projects and giving them a central role in the delivery of funding from the European regional development fund. The Government&#8217;s response, however, was to block them from receiving assets or even acquiring them by deferred payment. It was only the broad support across a whole host of business organisations for our direction of travel that pushed the Government into a climbdown over their proposed fire sale of RDA assets.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/4">The Government have given only limited seedcorn funding to LEPs&#8212;about &#163;6 million for 40. That remains inadequate and the future of LEPs, especially for those without enterprise zones as growth vehicles, remains fragile. The Government have also failed to address other key measures that would empower LEPs and give them the tools to do their job&#8212;despite repeated calls for the LEPs to be given more powers. As has been warned by the Federation of Small Businesses and, more recently, Centre for Cities in its report, the Government need to get a grip of underperforming LEPs before it is too late. There are real fears that entrepreneurs and local businesses in LEPs will simply walk away if they simply become talking shops&#8212;as the Forum of Private Business has warned in its briefing today.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/5">We have always argued on principle that money intended for the regions should remain in the regions. That is the stark contrast between our real localism and the Government&#8217;s sham localism. They preach localism but when they had the chance to give LEPs additional powers in the Localism Bill they funked it. As growth in the economy has flatlined, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has become progressively enfeebled as it has lost turf battles to the Department for Communities and Local Government and the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/6">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills still protests that the regional growth fund will save the day but, as my hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State has so forensically detailed, there is no more fitting emblem for its failures than the regional growth fund. Right from the start, the Department&#8217;s grasp on the fund has been feeble and flawed. In rounds one and two it was hopelessly oversubscribed, but the only response of the Minister of State was &#8220;That&#8217;s life&#8221;. Well, he should tell that to the consortia and to businesses. He should tell it to those who have had to wait an age for the cheque in the post. No wonder Andrew Neil said so memorably on &#8220;Daily Politics&#8221; to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, &#8220;The &#163;1.4 billion fund has so far disbursed &#163;5.8 million. Why is your Government so useless?&#8221; How many people does the Department have working on round two? The answer that was dragged out of them through parliamentary questions was that there are only 11 full-time staff working on the fund. We can do the maths ourselves. How long will it take 11 people to work through the 119 successful bids to the second round?</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/7">Small and medium-sized enterprises, which are a key element in growth across the regions, find themselves short-changed and unrepresented on a number of the boards. They are frozen out by the Government&#8217;s thresholds of &#163;1 million minimum on RGF funding and &#163;5 million on the business growth fund. No wonder there is such frustration. What is more, the growth fund seems to</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/8">have hardly any regional input. All the decisions are being micro-managed by Whitehall civil servants. There is no regional consultation or input and no sign that local offices will play a meaningful role in the process. With the propriety of some of their decisions called into account, the Government have pulled down the shutters on the detailed parliamentary questions that we have tabled about the process and the conflicts of interests on the advisory panel. That is not surprising, as BIS presides over a scheme into which it does not put a penny. Despite proclaiming, as he has done again today, the number of jobs that will be created, the Secretary of State has admitted that they are merely going on their own estimates.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/9">Despite the money that the Department for Transport has put into the growth fund, the fund has failed to look at new public transport projects or build on the importance of travel-to-work areas. The Government have abandoned the active industrial policy that, in our last years in office, we pursued, and that led to the successful carbon strategy pursued by One North East. Ministers from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills should have done everything in their power to unlock the European funding that did so much good and boosted jobs and growth across the regions, but in this, as in other areas, they have been sidelined.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/10">Why have the Government produced the Growing Places fund like a rabbit out of a hat? Is it because even the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government have given up on the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills? Once again, there will be no BIS input in the process&#8212;only tanks on its lawn from the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/11">England&#8217;s regions are full of people with ambitions and ideas about how to bring growth to their area, but the indecision and powerlessness shown by the BIS ministerial team has short-changed them and failed to rebalance our economy or provide a plan for growth. They have failed to stand up for the needs of local businesses, whether it is small towns in Kent or former industrial areas in the north-east. They have gone too far, too fast, in scrapping the regional development agencies and their collaborative structures, and become mangled in lost turf wars with CLG and the Treasury. They are like a rabbit caught in the headlights, petrified of the markets, but there are positive things that could be done for the fight. Roosevelt famously said that there is nothing to fear but &#8220;fear itself&#8221;, and Lincoln said that when the</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/12">&#8220;occasion is piled high with difficulty&#8230;we must rise high with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.353.1/13">The Opposition understand that, which is we have a five-point plan for growth. We understand that young people across England&#8217;s regions are crying out for the opportunities that our national insurance changes will provide by enabling us to build affordable homes and reduce VAT to 5% on repairs. We understand the need for an industrial strategy, and we understand the need for new ideas, and then, by thinking anew and acting anew, we will save our country.</p>

	<p pid="b.356.0/1">First, the previous Government inherited a boom, and then they bequeathed a bust and a massive deficit, so our top priority must be to deal with the consequences of that and keep out of the downward spiral into which countries such as Greece and Italy have fallen.</p>
	<p pid="b.356.0/2">As my hon. Friends the Members for Bedford (Richard Fuller), for Solihull (Lorely Burt), for South Basildon and East Thurrock (Stephen Metcalfe), and for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) have argued, more than ever we need a plan to give confidence to markets, businesses and our people. This debate was introduced by the shadow Secretary of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40588" name="Chuka Umunna">the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna)</phrase>. It was his first major outing, and I thought that his speech was fair. It was better on structure than on presentation&#8212;but then again, I suppose the 11 advisers write the speeches; they do not deliver them. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> No, I am a fan of the hon. Gentleman. It has become orthodox to say that he has been over-promoted, but I think that that is a welcome change from the self-promotion that has characterised his career so far. We can therefore be grateful that he is at the Dispatch Box, as he predicted he would be for so long.</p>
	<p pid="b.356.0/3">The problem with the hon. Gentleman and other Opposition Members&#8212;in fairness, we heard some good speeches from them&#8212;is that they still refuse to acknowledge that reducing the deficit is central to any credible plan. We only have to look at the continuing crisis on the continent to see what would happen if we do not do so. To be analytical about it, the hon. Gentleman made a speech about cyclical problems in a structural context. The issues around debt and deficit in this country are structural, and they will not be solved by cyclical solutions.</p>

	<p pid="b.356.1/1">The Minister seeks to give me a lecture on reducing the deficit. Can he explain why, as I asked the Secretary of State earlier, in the average of the independent forecasts, his Government are forecast to borrow more in every remaining year of this Parliament than we were under our more responsible deficit reduction strategy?</p>

	<p pid="b.356.2/1">That was the ponderous exaltation of a basic economic fact: when tax yields fall because there is less growth than expected, and welfare payments go up, of course that is a result, but it is not a reason not to have a credible fiscal policy.

	<p pid="b.357.0/1">No, I will not give way again. Time does not allow.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/2">So, the first thing we have to do is deal with the deficit. The second thing, as the Secretary of State said in his penetrating analysis of this weak motion, is to rebalance our economy in favour of making things, selling them and exporting them. That means an investment in human capital as well as in infrastructure. That is why we have put so much emphasis on apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/3">I noticed that, sensibly, neither the proposer of the motion, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40093" name="Gordon Marsden">the hon. Member for Streatham, nor the hon. Member for Blackpool South (Mr Marsden)</phrase>, who summed up and who has rather sensible views about these things for the most part, attacked our apprenticeships policy. They know that we have delivered the biggest growth in apprenticeships in modern history. They know that across regions and across sectors, we have shown growth in apprenticeship numbers. There is a great deal of discussion about this so let us get the facts on the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/4">Apprenticeships among 19 to 24-year-olds have grown by 64% in two years, and among 16 to 18-year-olds by 29% in two years. They have grown even more among over-25-year-olds, but the biggest proportion of growth has been at level 3. It has been across sectors and across regions. The biggest regional growth&#8212;I say this to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40174" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods)</phrase>&#8212;has been in the north-east.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/5">The third element of the strategy must be to deal with tax, cut red tape and bureaucracy, and support businesses to create jobs and fuel growth. Much has been said about what the Government have done in that respect. It is true that we have launched the growth and innovation fund, which is supporting life sciences, the creative industries, the hospitality industry and others. It is also true that the regional growth fund is doing that job as well. In the first phase the regional growth fund will support 50 projects and ultimately more than 150 projects. That will leverage more than &#163;8 billion of private sector investment to create or safeguard more than 300,000 jobs. That is the simple fact of the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/6">Labour does not have a credible alternative. The Opposition&#8217;s five-point plan is rooted in a denial about deficit which would undermine confidence in business and in the markets, push up interest rates and do lasting damage to Britain. The Labour party inherited a boom. Its legacy was a bust.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/7">The shadow Chancellor is not present, but his fingerprints are on the motion once again. He said recently that he cries at &#8220;The Sound of Music&#8221; and &#8220;Antiques Roadshow&#8221;. We all wondered why &#8220;Antiques Roadshow&#8221;. I will tell the House: he is wedded to the idea of an over-valued, tired out, worn out old Cabinet, and it is the one that he was in. The previous Government and current Opposition would be better taking advice from a singing nun than from the shadow Chancellor or the hon. Member for Streatham.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.0/8">I urge the House to choose between the past and the future, between despair and hope, between fantasy and reality, and vote for hopeful reality by opposing the motion.</p>

	<p pid="b.363.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House believes that solar power gives families, community organisations and businesses greater control over their energy bills and will help the UK meet its renewable energy targets and reduce carbon emissions; notes that since the creation of the feed-in tariffs scheme under the last administration, introduced with cross-party support, nearly 90,000 solar installations have been completed in the UK and the number of people employed in the solar industry has increased from 3,000 to 25,000; believes that the Government&#8217;s cuts to feed-in tariffs go too far, too fast, will hit jobs and growth in the solar industry, undermine confidence in the Green Deal and deter investment in the wider green economy; regrets that the cuts to feed-in tariffs were announced with just six weeks&#8217; notice and come into force before the consultation has even finished; further regrets that the Government&#8217;s plans would exclude nearly nine out of ten households from installing solar power under the feed-in tariffs scheme, will disproportionately hit social housing and community projects, and could affect thousands of households which have already installed solar power; and calls on the Government urgently to withdraw the <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December 2011</phrase> deadline and bring forward more measured proposals that guarantee the continued growth of the solar industry, put feed-in tariffs on a sustainable footing and are fair to the public.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/3">Exactly a year ago today, in a speech to the Micropower Council, the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40077" name="Gregory Barker">the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase> lauded the feed-in tariff scheme. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/4">&#8220;The coalition is absolutely committed to FITs&#8230;I have been really encouraged by the positive response that the FITs scheme has received since its introduction in April and hope this will continue. It&#8217;s still early days but early indications show that the scheme is working well&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/5">Well, they say a week is a long time in politics, but a year is obviously an eternity. However, at least the Minister is not on his own today, and we are glad to see the Secretary of State in his place. We all remember his famous energy summit, which went so well he decided to do a disappearing act. When his Department announced these cuts to feed-in tariffs, first, it tried to sneak them out in a written statement. Then, when I secured an urgent question, he sent his junior Minister to take the flack instead. Anyone would think he was trying to avoid me, or perhaps the Secretary of State is just very good at not getting caught at the crime scene. Either way, his fingerprints are all over this one.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.2/6">Although talk of feed-in tariffs might sound technical, their impact could not be more real. Some 25,000 jobs are on the line. Thousands of businesses are at risk and tens of thousands of people who have already installed solar could still lose out. Millions more have been excluded from having solar under the Government&#8217;s new rules and have been denied the chance to control their energy bills. That is all because we have a Government who are out of touch, cutting too far and too fast, with no plans for jobs and growth.</p>

	<p pid="b.364.0/2">At the outset, let me deal with a few of the myths that the Government have desperately resorted to peddling in defence of their plans and that appear in their motion today. The first and most bizarre is the idea that we were opposed to the introduction of feed-in tariffs and that somehow the Tories and the Liberal Democrats introduced them. It takes some audacity to try to claim credit for a scheme that was enacted, introduced and came into force under the previous Labour Government, but to try to take credit for a scheme that they are scrapping really takes the biscuit. The record will show that while Labour began this growth industry, the Government&#8217;s policies have all but killed it in its infancy.</p>
	<p pid="b.364.0/3">The second myth is the Government&#8217;s claim that the reason they are cutting the tariff level is because they are worried about energy bills.</p>

	<p pid="b.364.2/1">I will give way to the right hon. Gentleman in a moment. This from a Government who have cut help for more than 12 million pensioners with their heating bills this winter and who have stood back and done absolutely nothing as customers&#8217; bills have soared and energy companies&#8217; profits have rocketed.</p>
	<p pid="b.364.2/2">If the Secretary of State really wants to talk about energy bills, I will tell him a thing or two. Let us start with how much the average annual energy bill costs under this Government&#8212;&#163;1,345&#8212;and how much feed-in tariffs cost the public. From what the Government have said, one might think that this is costing us all hundreds of pounds a year, but it is not. Is it perhaps &#163;50 a year, or &#163;20, or even &#163;10? No, the actual figure, according to the independent regulator, Ofgem, is less than &#163;1 per household per year&#8212;less than &#163;1 at a time when the average energy bill stands at &#163;1,345, when pensioners are seeing their winter fuel payments cut by &#163;50 or more, and when standard tariffs are up by &#163;175 only since June. Labour and I will not take any lectures on energy prices from this Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.365.3/1">I respect the fact that the hon. Gentleman has probably raised concerns about how his coalition Ministers have approached this issue. As I said, according to Ofgem, we are talking about less than &#163;1 on people&#8217;s annual bills. What we said in our urgent question and have proposed in the motion is that we need to work to see how we can change the scheme as it moves forward, but in a sustainable way. The problem is that we have not had a chance to have this debate because the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Ministers, in his Government, have chosen to set a cut-off date of <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase> even though they are still consulting until <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-23">23 December</phrase>. When answering the questions about how we have got to where we are today, they have more to answer for than us.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.3/2">Myth No. 3 is that the scheme would run out of money if it carried on as it is. In the past few weeks, I have spoken to a lot of people in the solar industry. I have yet to find a single person who argues that the scheme should carry on unchanged. I am sure that that</p>
	<p pid="b.365.3/3">has come across in the lobbying of Members on both sides of the House. Not even the industry is calling for that. It wants planned, sensible reductions in tariffs. That is exactly what we would have done. When we introduced the scheme in 2010, we made it clear that there would be a review in 2013, or earlier if needed, to look at tariff levels and whether the scheme was delivering value for money.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.3/4">Let us get serious. We have a cut of more than 50% with just six weeks&#8217; notice. Is that reasonable? Is that fair? Is that sustainable? I suggest that it is not. To make matters worse, the first that the industry heard of it was when it was summoned to the Department after the announcement had been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.3/5">Frankly, the only reason that feed-in tariffs need reform is because this Government have managed the scheme so badly since coming to power. It is no good blaming us. Before the election, Conservative and Liberal Democrat Members accused us of lacking ambition. They said that what we set up did not go far enough. The Conservative party said that feed-in tariffs should be paid to solar installed before April 2010 and that it would raise the capacity threshold for qualifying schemes from 5 MW to 10 MW. The position of the Liberal Democrats was also clear. Far from saying that our scheme was too generous, they wanted it to be more generous. Their spokesman at the time, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.365.3/6">&#8220;Labour&#8217;s plans are too little too late.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.365.3/7">I tried to speak to him on Monday to confirm that that was still his position, but he spurned my advances. We wait to see whether he will join us in the Lobby this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.3/8">The fourth myth is that if we did not implement the Government&#8217;s cuts, solar power would be available only to the lucky few. However, it is the Secretary of State&#8217;s cuts that will exclude nearly nine out of 10 households from having solar power. It is his cuts that will prevent families living in social housing from having solar power. It is his cuts that will once again make solar power the preserve of the wealthy few.</p>

The German Government invested &#8364;6.5 billion in solar last year; we are investing &#163;860 million over four years. Germany has installed half the solar panels in the world and supports 250,000 jobs in solar; we have installed just 90,000 panels and have only one tenth of the jobs. This year the tariff for solar power in Germany was cut by 15%, in agreement with</p>
	<p pid="b.367.5/3">industry and only after installation levels reached a fixed benchmark: here the Government have announced a cut of more than 50%, with no proper consultation and only six weeks&#8217; notice, which will take our solar tariff below that of Germany.</p>
	<p pid="b.367.5/4">None of the Government&#8217;s excuses will wash, because the truth is that their cuts to the feed-in tariff for solar power are a triple whammy. They are bad for jobs and growth, bad for the public and bad for the environment.</p>

	<p pid="b.368.1/1">Dearie me! The Germans have been planning how to staircase down their tariffs for years. They have a mature industry that is the world leader. We are not in that ballpark. That is why we must ensure that we do not strangle our industry is strangled at birth.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.1/2">The cuts are bad for jobs and growth, bad for the public and bad for the environment. When growth is flatlining and unemployment rising, solar is one industry that is growing and creating jobs. When the previous Government introduced feed-in tariffs, just 3,000 people were working in 450 firms; today more than 25,000 people work in 3,000 companies. By 2020, as many as 360,000 people could be working in solar&#8212;but not if the Government&#8217;s cuts go ahead. Be in no doubt that the Government&#8217;s current plans will strangle the solar industry and cost thousands, if not tens of thousands, of jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.1/3">A survey conducted by the Renewable Energy Association and the Solar Trade Association earlier this month forecast in excess of 10,000 job losses. Fifty-seven per cent. of companies anticipate having to lay off at least half their current staff, a third are worried that their business will be forced to close altogether, and fewer than one in six are confident that they can weather the changes. That is the reality.</p>

	<p pid="b.368.2/1">Is the Minister not missing the point about the comparison with Germany? The purpose of the tariffs in this country is to build up our industry and get it up and running, but cuts on this scale at this pace risk throwing the industry into reverse. Those production and new design skills that my right hon. Friend mentioned will be lost at a time when the Government should be helping to cut fuel bills for householders and cut the country&#8217;s reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

As someone I met at the lobby of Parliament yesterday put it, the Government may think that they</p>

Ofgem, the independent regulator, made it absolutely clear that the feed-in tariffs cost less than &#163;1 a year per household. The bigger problem is how prices have been put up while energy companies are making exorbitant profits, and while this Government are cutting the support available to people this winter. That is a price debate that I would like to have. The comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40279" name="Richard Graham">the hon.

	<p pid="b.369.5/2">For every job in the solar industry, many more in the supply chain are also at risk. According to the Minister&#8217;s colleagues in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the solar industry and its supply chain employ about 39,000 people and resulted in nearly &#163;5 billion of sales last year. All of that is in jeopardy. Sharp Solar, which was mentioned by my hon.

It is now warning that because of these cuts it is reviewing its presence in the UK, putting hundreds of jobs on the line. Given that we need to invest up to &#163;200 billion in our energy infrastructure in the next 10 years, how can anyone have</p>

	<p pid="b.370.0/1">Before the right hon. Lady scaremongers any further, may I confirm that I spoke to the European head of sales at Sharp yesterday, and it has no plans to close its UK plant? It remains an important centre of European manufacturing.</p>

	<p pid="b.370.1/2">Since we introduced feed-in tariffs nearly 90,000 families have benefited. That has helped those who want to do the right thing and green their homes, while also trying to protect themselves from soaring energy bills. However, under the Government&#8217;s plans nearly nine out of 10 households in England will be excluded from solar power and denied the chance to get just a little more control over their energy bills. That is because properties will be eligible for feed-in tariffs only if they have a minimum energy performance rating of C or above.</p>

	<p pid="b.370.3/1">No, I will not give way.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.3/2">However, the most recent estimate showed that 86% of properties in England had an energy efficiency rating of D or below. Those households will be excluded from solar power. The Government&#8217;s plans are unfair, too, not least because they could hit people who have already installed solar power. In fact, the cuts could hit people who installed solar power before the Government even announced the changes. That is the problem with a six-week deadline, when it takes up to seven weeks to get a solar installation on the FITs register. Those people are going to lose out. In answer to a parliamentary question the Minister of State, the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.370.3/3">&#8220;We recognise though that some prospective FITs generators who have incurred or committed expenditure may not be able to complete their installations and submit their applications for FITs before the proposed reference date.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-11-10.409"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 November 2011; Vol. 535, c. 409W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.370.3/4">What the Minister calls &#8220;prospective FITs generators&#8221; are people&#8212;thousands of them&#8212;who have already installed solar, but not yet registered. They will be caught up in a mess entirely of the Government&#8217;s making. They include, for example, the pensioners who wrote to me telling me that they had invested their savings in solar power to try to get their heating bills down and give themselves a little income in their retirement.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.3/5">By cutting the tariff by an additional 20% for councils, housing associations and community groups, on top of the 50% cut, the Government&#8217;s changes will all but end solar power for social housing. Across the country, from Cambridge to Wrexham, Torbay to Leeds, Reading to Haringey, councils are already scrapping their solar plans; and last week it happened in Doncaster, too. As a result, those councils are forgoing funds that they could have invested&#8212;and that they planned to invest&#8212;in other energy efficiency measures for their tenants.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.3/6">All Governments get accused of not listening, but it takes a special kind of arrogance&#8212;not to mention a healthy dose of incompetence&#8212;to launch a consultation that is half the normal length and closes after the cuts on which it is consulting come into force. What happens when the consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-23">23 December</phrase> and all the responses tell the Government that their cuts go too far, too fast, and will kill the solar industry? What happens to all the projects that have already been scaled back or scrapped altogether? What happens to all the families who have already decided to cancel their solar installation? What happens to all the firms that have had to lay off their staff&#8212;to all the engineers, technicians and installation teams who have lost their jobs before Christmas? What happens to them? What all this says is that the Government do not care what anybody thinks; and what it shows is that they are completely out of touch.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.3/7">When the economy is flatlining, unemployment is rising and even the Prime Minister admits that his plan is failing, what sort of Government choose to kill an industry that is growing and creating jobs? When energy prices are at record levels and millions of families are struggling with their bills, what sort of Government choose to exclude nine out of 10 households and everyone in social housing from installing solar to cut their bills? When Ministers are flying halfway around the world to Durban next week to try and reach an agreement on climate change, what sort of Government choose to cut back on policies that will increase our supply of renewable energy and reduce our carbon emissions?</p>
	<p pid="b.370.3/8">From the CBI, the Mayor of London and the man who installed the Prime Minister&#8217;s solar panels, all the way to the Welsh Liberal Democrats and Friends of the Earth, everyone is backing our campaign and telling the Government that they have got this badly wrong. Today we have come to a crossroads. Much damage has already been done. Many projects have been ditched. Confidence has been dented, with future investment possibly lost for good. However, we can step back from the brink. We can put feed-in tariffs on a sustainable footing, in a way that is fair to the public and which secures the future of one of our brightest industries. Today I call on all hon. Members to support our motion&#8212;to tell the Government to scrap their <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase> deadline, to stand up for an industry that is growing and creating jobs, and to stand up for people who want to do the right thing and protect themselves from rising bills. I commend this motion to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.371.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move an amendment, to leave out from &#8220;House&#8221; to the end of the Question and add:</p>
	<p pid="b.371.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">&#8220;notes that the previous administration only introduced a feed-in tariffs scheme following pressure from Liberal Democrat and Conservative hon. Members; further notes that during the period up to October 2011 over 120,000 UK solar installations had been completed; further notes that this is three times the deployment expected by the previous administration; recognises that no commercial-scale solar PV schemes were expected by the previous administration; further notes that the cost of PV panels has fallen by at least 30 per cent. since the current tariff was introduced and that the previous administration set the tariff levels for solar PV to deliver a five per cent. index-linked return; regrets that the</p>
	<p pid="b.371.0/3">previous administration did not draw on the experiences of Germany in setting a sustainable and predictable digression of tariffs; further notes that failing to act could add &#163;26 to the domestic electricity bill of all consumers in 2020 including the 5.5 million people left in fuel poverty by the previous administration; further regrets that the previous administration did not introduce a community tariff; believes that the Government is right to bring the tariff levels back in line with the rates of return envisaged; acknowledges that it is right to link support under feed-in tariffs to energy efficiency and the Green Deal ensuring the most cost-effective carbon abatement measures are introduced first; supports a consultation on the introduction of a community tariff; and further believes that the Government is putting feed-in tariffs on a long-term, fair and sustainable footing.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.371.0/4">We find ourselves here to debate a motion that would add at least &#163;26 to an average consumer bill&#8212;that is, if we were to leave the scheme unchanged. The estimates are constantly being revised, and the figure may well reach as high as &#163;80 on the current trajectory. The proposal would give bumper profits to solar companies and do little to tackle climate change. There seems to be no awareness whatever on the part of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40206" name="Caroline Flint">the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase> or other Opposition Members that those are real costs, being imposed on real people, who will be unable to spend the money on other goods and services as a result. Every corner shop across the length and breadth of the land would be affected if disposable incomes were hit in that way. Some of the people who are in the greatest fuel poverty&#8212;about whom Labour Members are meant to be most concerned&#8212;will be most affected by these increases.</p>
	<p pid="b.371.0/5">Feed-in tariffs have been successful. They have helped many people produce green energy locally, which is why, before we were coalition partners, Liberal Democrats and Conservatives supported their introduction. Solar energy has been particularly popular, with more than 140,000 homes now generating some of their own electricity. Unfortunately, this promising scheme was built on shaky economic foundations. In setting the returns, the previous Government completely underestimated the potential for cost reductions in the sector. They assumed that solar panels would cost just 9% less to install in 2012 than they would in 2013. As we heard from the right hon. Member for Don Valley, Labour did not propose to review this matter before 2013. In fact, costs are falling and falling fast&#8212;at least 30% since the scheme started. The result is that returns on solar photovoltaic investments are double what was originally envisaged.</p>

	<p pid="b.374.3/1">I absolutely do not accept that. Not a single solar installer to whom I have spoken does not say that tariffs must fall, and on that point I entirely agree, but that was not the case before. This is another of the key cock-ups made by the Leader of the Opposition when he was doing the job that I am now doing. He failed to learn from the experience of Germany, which was very clear: those who introduce a scheme involving solar feed-in tariffs must introduce an automatic digression to take account of the real world. But of course Opposition Members are not very familiar or comfortable with the real world of business. The fact is that there should have been a reduction in the tariffs as a matter of automaticity.</p>

	<p pid="b.374.7/1">The right hon. Lady makes a good and serious point, which returns me to what I was saying before. We need to consider, and consult on, whether there should be a separate tariff for social schemes. Many social housing providers offer their tenants free electricity to encourage take-up&#8212;free electricity that has been rising in value because of the rise in world gas prices and the rise in UK electricity prices. That is an important part of the rate of return. If providers give</p>
	<p pid="b.374.7/2">all that to their tenants, the amount that is left from the feed-in tariff to compensate for their financing costs will be less. However, we are not legally able to provide a separate tariff, because the Labour party did not implement such an arrangement when it was in government. I regret that, because it would have given us some flexibility.</p>

Friend that the returns that the new scheme will provide&#8212;if, indeed, we proceed with it following what is a genuine consultation&#8212;will be very similar to the returns that were originally intended when the scheme was announced by the Leader of the Opposition in April 2010. As with some of the Opposition&#8217;s other achievements, the intention was right but the execution was definitely not, so it falls to this Government to attempt to clear up the mess.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.1/2">We want to secure the continued success of feed-in tariffs through sustainable growth, rather than boom and bust.

	<p pid="b.375.3/1">Before I give way again, let me address this key point. To wait any longer would put at risk the entire feed-in tariff scheme. Anything that slows this process will substantially increase the risk that the scheme will run out of money. Each week of delay in changing the tariffs leads to additional annual subsidy costs of &#163;4 million, but this is a 25-year scheme, and the figure over the spending review period is &#163;14 million, or &#163;87 million to &#163;110 million over the 25-year tariff lifetime. A very small delay in tackling this problem will therefore result in substantial costs for electricity consumers over a 25-year period.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.3/2">My experience tells me that when we face such a problem, we should not follow the advice of the right hon. Member for Don Valley and attempt to run away from it by pretending it does not exist. Instead, we must grapple with this problem, and deal with it quickly so the scheme can be put on a sustainable basis that will give the industry the opportunity to grow and prosper.</p>

	<p pid="b.375.4/1">This is a strange debate, as the Opposition seem to be on the side of big business, while we are on the side of the squeezed middle. Does the Secretary of State agree that the &#163;1 figure Ofgem cited was for back in the summer when</p>
	<p pid="b.375.4/2">installations were running at about 2,000 to 3,000 a week, rather than the recent rate of 9,000 or so a month, and would that figure not have grown exponentially over time?</p>

	<p pid="b.376.0/1">My hon. Friend is correct. I wish the House had facilities to show a PowerPoint presentation at this point, as I am now holding up a chart showing what has been happening with the scheme. The rising curve represents the installation rate increase. The Opposition cite the Ofgem figure of &#163;1, but that applies down in the foothills of the curve, and we are dealing with a rather different real world today. Installed capacity has doubled since August, and has increased by three times since June and by tenfold since the start of the year. The right hon. Member for Don Valley is laughing; she has obviously had no experience of attempting to manage a budget, because if she had, she would not be laughing at all.

However, I shall place the graph I have been showing in the Library so that everybody can look at it. The situation is moving so swiftly that projections based on the current week&#8217;s figures would look rather more alarming than those for last week or the week before that. The real world is changing exceptionally rapidly. The impact assessment gives a clear statement of where we were at the point when the impact assessment was made. At that point, the figure was &#163;26 on average energy bills for 2020 and the latest estimate is now up to &#163;80&#8212;and at the high end of that if there is substantial growth. That takes me back to the point that if we do not deal with the issue quickly, we are not saving the industry, as the Opposition would like us to believe, but writing the death warrant for it.

They might make less money than they previously planned&#8212;that occasionally arises&#8212;but the business of my Department is not to provide extra rate support grants to local councils but to ensure that we have a successful renewable energy scheme and that we get solar panels out there. It is not a back-door way of funding extra support.</p>

	<p pid="b.377.1/1">I agree with everything my right hon. Friend is saying, but surely the problem is that all the schemes that subsidise renewable energy tend to distort the market and have perverse consequences, and therefore perhaps the Duke of Edinburgh had a point over the weekend.</p>

I do not agree with my hon. Friend on the issue of distortions to the market because, curiously, solar photovoltaics are a clear example of a highly successful world market. The right hon. Member for Don Valley was talking about Sharp Solar as though it was dependent on the UK, but more than three quarters of the production in Wrexham goes overseas to the rest of Europe. We have already heard that the funding is exactly in line with that in Germany. The Chinese are exporting dramatic amounts of solar panels and what is fascinating, exciting and positive about the industry is the fact that in the long run&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.377.4/2">The key point I want to make, which was drawn to my attention by the US Energy Secretary Steve Chu, is that almost uniquely among the renewable energy forms, solar panels are reducing in price by an average of 6% a year. As a result of that technological trend, which is a bit like the fall in the cost of computer memory that many of us will be familiar with, this area will have enormous potential in the long run. The argument for putting the industry on a more sustainable basis so that it can grow solidly and reliably with a tariff that reflects the fall in the underlying costs means that we will be in a position, when the costs of solar fall to grid parity, to make major and substantial increases in solar installation. I do not agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40266" name="Edward Leigh">the Member for Gainsborough (Mr Leigh)</phrase> that this is a waste of time. The world market is working, but the scheme has been</p>
	<p pid="b.377.4/3">thrown out by the fact that we have had a dramatic fall in the costs of solar panels in the past 18 months. Unfortunately, the scheme introduced by the previous Labour Government did not have the automatic reduction that it should have done.</p>

	<p pid="b.378.0/1">I am almost too tired to stand up now, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I thank the Secretary of State for giving way. It is precisely because of the arguments he has outlined that the Labour Government in New South Wales in Australia cut their tariff by two thirds.</p>
	<p pid="b.378.0/2">I want to put a question to the Secretary of State on behalf of my constituents at Alexander Electrical Services.

	<p pid="b.378.1/1">I come back to the point that if we had not acted quickly on this we would have had a situation in which every installation at the old tariff rate would have meant two fewer installations at the new tariff rate. That would have meant massively over-subsidising when we could have got the deployment at the new tariff rate. There is no doubt about that. We have had many e-mails from reliable, long-standing solar installers who recognise that the scheme needed to be changed. They&#8212;particularly the reliable installers&#8212;want it to be put on a sustainable basis that will give them the ability to grow sustainably.</p>

Will the Minister look again at the situation, particularly in rural areas where getting basic parts can be a problem? Will he give more time before he introduces this draconian cut-off rate in rural areas?</p>

	<p pid="b.378.3/1">I have to say that, to some extent, I rest my case in that regard. A substantial scheme that requires planning permission in the Western Isles will clearly be one for which, arguably, the solar yield will be very substantial. I do not know whether that is the case, but I come back to the point that if we do not deal with this issue we will deprive the industry of future growth prospects. The more we pay out at the higher rate the less we pay out at the lower rate. That is why we proposed the date of <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase>&#8212;to give well-advanced projects six clear weeks in which to finalise and thus receive the current tariffs. We are consulting on this and we are open-minded about it. Hon. Members should remember that schemes after that reference date will continue to receive the old tariff all the way through to April&#8212;only then will they go on to the new tariff.

	<p pid="b.379.3/2">On social housing, I have already said that we will consult on whether it is appropriate to have a separate tariff for genuine community projects. Those who have already installed solar PV and who are registered for feed-in tariffs will not be affected. The right hon. Member for Don Valley suggested that they might be but that is completely incorrect and is scaremongering. I can totally reassure anyone that this approach is consistent with our long-standing principle in the House of not making retrospective changes. We have to strike a delicate balance between acting quickly, for the reasons that I have given, and allowing people to finish work that is well under way.

	<p pid="b.379.5/1">I will take some more interventions with your forgiveness, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I will try to make progress too.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.5/2">A consultation is under way, and we will consider carefully all the representations that are made, including on the proposed reference date and how best to implement an energy efficiency requirement. It is not the case, for example, that large numbers of people will be excluded, because it is possible to insist on a C rating. Many people could easily be upgraded to a C rating, which would increase the market enormously. Furthermore, we could make solar panels available to anyone who is prepared to take part in the green deal when it is launched and which, of course, is cost-free to the household. We will look at that, and we will announce our final intentions early in the new year. Our proposal is that the revised tariffs should take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-01">1 April 2012</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.5/3">The decision to consult on revised tariffs and the proposed reference date was not taken lightly. I am sure that Members from all parts of the House agree that</p>
	<p pid="b.379.5/4">increasing the share of locally generated renewables is a good thing, not just for our carbon reduction targets, but for households and communities. However, spending the best part of &#163;1 billion of public money to support soaring profits for one part of the energy sector is not the way to build a lasting low-carbon economy. It will not deliver more renewable energy or help more households. As that public money comes directly from the purses of bill payers, including people in fuel poverty, it is not the fairest way either. Many Members will have received letters from companies offering solar PV. Many of those letters are written in defence of the industry, but they are guided by a passion, quite rightly, for clean green energy as well as a stronger bottom line.</p>
	<p pid="b.379.5/5">I am as disappointed as many of my constituents that the feed-in tariff scheme was not properly set up. To paraphrase the right hon. Member for Don Valley, we would not have to cut so far or so fast if the policy had been properly costed to begin with. A little more foresight then would have gone a long way now. I have described the mistakes that were made by my predecessor in failing to take into account what was happening in the marketplace, but another mess that we had to clear up after the Labour Government left office was the business-scale scheme, which was going off like a rocket. We had to deal with that earlier this year because, under the proposals introduced by the Labour Government, it was assumed that businesses were too stupid to respond to a substantial real return and would not install any solar PV for three years. If we had not acted, half of Devon and Cornwall would have been under PV panels.</p>

	<p pid="b.381.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. If the previous Government had bothered to find out how well-managed feed-in tariffs are run in countries such as Germany, they would have built in an automatic system which brought the tariffs down in line with the fall in costs, but they did not. The result was a massive over-compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.1/2">Contrary to the claims that we have heard from the Opposition, we are not shutting down an industry, which is what would happen if the money ran out. The revised tariffs will provide inflation-proofed returns for 25 years of around 5%. That remains competitive with other investment opportunities. A householder would still be able to get a 4.5% real post-tax return. This compares well, for example, with the 0.5% post-tax real return currently available through index-linked National Savings bonds.</p>

	<p pid="b.381.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point, but I have dealt with that issue in response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40564" name="Alan Whitehead">the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead)</phrase>. This is such a movable feast that every time we do a projection, we find that the budget is being eaten up even more rapidly, so we have put out, in the impact assessment, a very clear projection on the basis of the knowledge that we had when the consultation was launched about what would happen overall&#8212;that is, a very substantial increase in the overall budget and a &#163;26 increase in household bills. The revisions that we have done since then suggest that, if anything, things will be moving even more rapidly.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.3/2">By the way, the returns still compare favourably with the returns intended when the scheme was set up. Our proposals are the difference between windfall profits from double-digit returns and a reasonable return&#8212;double-digit returns that would bring into the industry all sorts of curious people who never had any previous interest in it and who were operating tax avoidance schemes to raise money to invest in the industry. The scheme had been growing dangerously unbalanced. We are working to put it back on an even keel. I do not accept that putting right the feed-in tariffs scheme undermines confidence, for the reasons that I have given.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.3/3">Aside those from those such as electricians and scaffolders who have branched out into solar PV installation alongside other employment, our analysis suggests that the number of full-time equivalent jobs in the solar industry is between 8,000 and 14,000. We do not wish to see a single company stop trading or a single job lost, but we cannot continue to prop up unreasonable profits with consumer cash. Jobs created by a bubble of excessive returns and paid for by consumer energy bills are simply unsustainable. Companies that have prepared themselves accordingly are likely to continue. As I have said, I have not come across a single person in the industry who contests the fact that we needed to act, although we did not hear that loud and clear before we acted, contrary to what various Opposition Members have said. Companies that were going all out with installations for the next few months with no plans beyond that will be in a position that is only slightly different from what would otherwise have been the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.382.0/1">The Secretary of State makes a compelling case for the need for change, but will he consider a concession for those businesses that have already paid a deposit? Pennywell farm in my constituency aims to be the first carbon-neutral tourist attraction in the country and has already received a gold business award for energy conservation. It has already paid a 10% deposit, but the costs of meeting the <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase> deadline will increase its costs by 11% and it faces great difficulty as a result.</p>

	<p pid="b.382.1/1">I hear what my hon. Friend says, and she is not contesting the fact that there will still be a positive return. That comes back to the point I was making. People might not make as much money as they thought they would, because the scheme had not been brought into line with the fall in the cost of panels, but they will still make a positive return. My Department&#8217;s key objective is to ensure that we make the transition to a low-carbon economy, not to provide excessive subsidies where they are not warranted by the action that is to be taken. If she would like to write to me with the details of her example, we will take it into account as part of the consultation. I repeat that it is a genuine consultation.</p>
	<p pid="b.382.1/2">The revised tariffs will allow the feed-in tariffs to work in the way they were intended to, supporting the industry and jobs in the long term, rather than burning brightly for a few short months before fading away. The right hon. Member for Don Valley might urge on us the attractions of becoming a sort of policy Catherine-wheel in which we are all fizz, but we do not particularly want to be followed by all phutt, which is exactly what we would have if the Labour party was to have its suggestion.</p>
	<p pid="b.382.1/3">I am sure that Members will join me in supporting long-term ambition across the whole green economy, rather than windfalls for the few.</p>
	<p pid="b.382.1/4">The Government are committed to supporting sustainable low-carbon energy, but we cannot continue to write blank cheques. By bringing solar PV returns in line with other investment opportunities, we are guaranteeing the success of the feed-in tariff scheme as a whole, which will mean more renewable energy delivered to more households in a sustainable way.</p>

	<p pid="b.383.2/1">It is a great pleasure once again to follow the Secretary of State, but I am afraid I cannot resist referring to his last remark on policy Catherine-wheels. He is the man who said that the nuclear industry was flawed and should not continue, but today he is Mr Nuclear. He said that solar panel feed-in tariffs were not ambitious enough, but now he says that they are flawed and too ambitious. He is the undisputed champion of flip-flops. Today he has told us that he is looking after the interests of the consumer, but he is doing exactly the opposite.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.2/2">Since entering the House, I have been a consistent supporter of nuclear energy, renewable energy and energy efficiency as a package. I see no contradiction in that whatsoever. It will help consumers in the short term and the environment in the long term, which is what proper policy is about.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.2/3">We do not have much time today, but, because of the country&#8217;s anger at the policy changes, we are here today, arguing the case for consumers.

	<p pid="b.383.2/4">It was not just the industry, but ordinary individuals who took this Government on trust, and they have broken it. The Liberal Democrats know that, because they argued that the scheme was not ambitious enough. Indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon.

	<p pid="b.384.3/1">The Secretary of State has not read the Opposition&#8217;s motion or listened to what the shadow Secretary of State said about the need for a sliding scale.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/2">I shall read out three examples, because they speak not just for my constituents, but for constituents throughout the country. A Mr Jones wrote to me this month, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/3">&#8220;I am writing to you as a retired NHS employee, who recently decided to invest my pension lump sum monies into clean energy and have just installed PV solar panel system on my house. My decision was based on the Government&#8217;s existing tariffs and estimated returns on the substantial investment and proceeded with the installation in the last week of October. I was unaware of the Government&#8217;s consultation document before proceeding. I only recently heard about the changes on a news bulletin&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/4">He believes that the process is deceitful, because it cuts off before the consultation period is done. He says that he understands the rationale for changes, as do all of us, but the proposed changes will be made without any meaningful public consultation. Indeed, the Secretary of State has suggested that individual write in, and that the consultation changes will be made on a case-by-case basis. What a sham&#8212;for the Government of the day to say, &#8220;We will look at individual cases and maybe give a bit of leeway.&#8221; People want a proper strategy and consistency.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/5">Another constituent, a young person who has been self-employed for 10 years&#8212;the kind of person whom the Government say they want to help&#8212;came to see me. He has moved from various installation projects, including central heating systems, to the PV system, and he has employed extra people. He says:</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/6">&#8220;I am writing regarding the recent feed in tariff problems as I am sure you are aware of. I have had to lay off two installers last week for two weeks so far&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/7">and he cannot see himself bringing them back. His office assistant is, he says,</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/8">&#8220;down to two days a week from five days&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/9">and he cannot honestly see his company trading: it will cease trading because of the proposals. That is the kind of reaction we are getting from communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/10">A third person who wrote to me put across her point straightforwardly, as Anglesey people do, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/11">&#8220;I was horrified to see the high handed fashion in which the Government has eliminated the&#8230;Micro Generation Industry. By&#8230;slashing the value of the electricity feed-in tariff, they are effectively ending the provision of free solar panels to the electorate and endangering the jobs of tens of thousands of people. Not since the Thatcher Government of the 1980&#8217;s have those in power set out to put an end to a sector of the economy overnight.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/12">That was not a Labour supporter who was known to me, but an ordinary constituent who took the trouble to write in. That is the situation that people are finding themselves in, and it is the scale of the downgrading of the tariffs that is concerning everybody.</p>
	<p pid="b.384.3/13">I say to the Minister of State, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40077" name="Gregory Barker">the hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase>, who is going to wind up the debate, that he should listen to the debate&#8212;I do not think he is listening at the moment. He should not just give the speech that has been written for him by civil servants, but he should listen to the debate and listen to what the people of this country are saying. They understand the need for deficit reduction, but they also have trust in Governments, and when they enter a scheme, they want to see it through. They want to help the country&#8217;s economy and create jobs, and jobs have indeed been created. They want to save the economy, but they also want to save the environment. That was why the scheme was set up. Yes, it needs to be reviewed, but the Government are destroying it, and I ask them to think again.</p>

	<p pid="b.385.0/1">I am very grateful to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me early in this debate. Right at the beginning, I want to nail my flag to the pole as being very pro-solar. I believe that solar power offers us a great opportunity to change how we generate power, in a green way that protects the environment and lowers our carbon footprint. As a member of the Environmental Audit Committee, I have been very keen to push forward schemes such as solar and anaerobic digestion, which also offers us a great opportunity. Those schemes provide energy without having a great impact on neighbouring sites.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.0/2">I am keen to set out the position in which the Government found themselves when they came to power. After 13 years of a Labour Government, we faced the real prospect of an energy crisis. We risked a gap in the supply to the general market and in this country&#8217;s ability to find energy to keep the lights on in our homes and ensure that our businesses can thrive and move forward. It is a damning fact that the previous Government did not grasp the nettle and sort out this country&#8217;s energy supply to ensure that we can operate securely.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.0/3">To that end, I probably part company from the Secretary of State in saying that I think that the real answer to delivering large-scale energy production will be nuclear. The previous Government should have taken quicker action to deliver it. Coming from the constituency of Sherwood, and from the former coalfields of Nottingham, I believe that the other way in which we can solve the crisis is through carbon capture and storage, using coal-fired power in a green way so that it does not increase our carbon footprint.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.0/4">The most important point to recognise is that a lack of action is simply not an option. We cannot continue the way we are going. We are a victim of the enormous</p>
	<p pid="b.385.0/5">success of the feed-in tariffs scheme. People have really embraced the opportunity to put solar panels on their own homes. Unfortunately, we pitched it at an unsustainable level, and the only option is to reduce the subsidy to a level that still allows the industry to continue and people to deliver solar panels.</p>
	<p pid="b.385.0/6">Opposition Members have referred to what happens in Germany. The simple fact is that we are reducing our support to the same level that exists in Germany, and the industry is sustainable there. I am not an astronomer, but my understanding is that we share the same sun, and the strength of the sunlight is the same. If the industry can thrive in Germany at the same level of subsidy, I believe it can be sustainable in this country. The truth is that time will tell whether we are right or wrong. I believe that as we move forward, the industry will carry on and people will still be able to make use of the opportunities provided.</p>

	<p pid="b.386.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very interesting point about Germany. He will perhaps be aware that, in the last year of the previous Government, Germany was getting approximately 10% of its energy from renewables, while we were getting 2.5%. We have a lot to learn from Germany.</p>

	<p pid="b.386.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. We can learn from some of the things Germany got right and some of things it got wrong. That is the way to move forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.1/2">Basically, there is a simple calculation. We need to get more solar panels for each pound we spend, and the Secretary of State&#8217;s suggestions would deliver more panels per pound. That is the simple calculation we have to make. The other thing we need to do is bring the technology into the mainstream.</p>

	<p pid="b.386.2/1">One of the issues the Opposition have been discussing today is that of jobs and lost jobs. Clearly, if twice as many panels are being built sustainably in the longer term, there will be a lot more jobs.</p>

	<p pid="b.386.3/1">That is absolutely true.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.3/2">As I was starting to outline, the other thing we need to do is to bring the technology into the mainstream. This is no longer some green dream. Solar panels are a real opportunity to deliver a credible energy source to our homes. Many companies that focus solely on solar power have been established, but we need to tackle the matter by ensuring that normal contractors&#8212;electricians and plumbers&#8212;look at such technologies as an alternative.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.3/3">At the moment, an example of what happens is this. Mrs Jones&#8217;s boiler will break down and a plumber will come along. If the plumber does not have the expertise to say, &#8220;These are the alternative renewable sources of energy that you can look at,&#8221; she will have a normal gas-fired boiler fitted in her home. We need to bring such technologies into the mainstream, so that regular electricians and plumbers have the experience to deliver them. I hope that, as the scheme is successful, they will be able to tap into it and deliver that. I am not just talking about specialised solar companies, but normal, everyday contractors. That is starting to happen and will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.3/4">I am very conscious of the time, so I shall summarise the matter quickly and leave my colleagues time to speak. We inherited an energy supply system that was in tatters. We have had to tackle that at the same time as greening our energy supply and lowering our carbon footprint. That is an enormous challenge. We have made some very good progress, but there is a way to go and, under the current Administration and with the support of the Secretary of State, we can make great progress.</p>

	<p pid="b.387.0/1">I share the concerns of Labour Members. The shadow Secretary of State made a very powerful speech, but I want to concentrate on a constituents&#8217; case because the Secretary of State does not seem to think that the December deadline is a problem. However, my constituents&#8217; case is a perfect illustration of why it is a problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-02">2 November</phrase>, my constituents learned that the Department of Energy and Climate Change had changed the date from <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-31">31 March 2012</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-08">8 December 2011</phrase> for reducing the feed-in tariff rate for solar panels fitted to domestic properties from 43%. At the 43% FIT level, they calculated that they could borrow &#163;12,000 to install solar panels and that they would break even on the loan repayments. The week before, they signed a contract for solar panels to be installed before <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-31">31 March 2012</phrase> and paid just over &#163;7,000 as a deposit. At that time, there was no indication that DECC was about to make a sudden change to the date for introducing the revised FIT rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/3">My constituents immediately feared that the contractor may not be able to have the system installed and their registration complete within the new time frame set by DECC. If that happened, they would be trapped in a contract from which they would be making a monthly loss that they cannot afford for the next 25 years. They would not have signed up to the contract if DECC had made it known that it was about to change the time frame for introducing the revised rate. My constituents acted in good faith and believe that the original tariff agreement to <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase> should be honoured or maintained at that level for people such as them who have already signed contracts and paid significant deposits with no guarantee that work and registration will be completed before <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-08">8 December</phrase>. That should be taken into consideration. It was completely unreasonable to give five weeks&#8217; notice of such a significant change at a time when suppliers and installers are exceptionally busy meeting the demands of the original <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-31">31 March</phrase> deadline.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/4">Following this shock, my constituents have been working closely with panel suppliers and installation contractors to complete the work prior to the new cut-off date. Luckily for them, the work has been completed, the system is installed, and registration documents have been submitted to their energy supplier. The registration documents were sent to the energy company by special delivery on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-19">Saturday 19 November</phrase>, and they breathed a sigh of relief because this gave, or so they thought, plenty of time for registration prior to the December cut-off. The energy company has now informed them that it cannot guarantee that the registration documents will be processed prior to the December cut-off date</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/5">because it is receiving unanticipated levels of rushed applications to make the new deadline, and that has resulted in a significant slowing in the registration process.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.0/6">My constituents believe that this is, by default, another way for DECC to ensure that fewer people are able to receive the previously agreed tariff, and the Secretary of State openly admitted that in his speech. They rightly believe that this looks like another example of people entering into contracts with this Government only to have the goalposts moved without due consideration or proper consultation and find that they are left to take the financial hit. They were already in the position that 60% of the costs had been paid to the contractor and they could not reasonably cancel the contract. Having fast-tracked the installation process, they are now faced with another barrier to registration whereby, through the Government&#8217;s action, they will be tied into a green energy contract rather than breaking even. This leaves them with making a significant loss for the next 25 years, through no fault of their own. They tried to do the right thing; perhaps the Government should now do the right thing and change the deadline.</p>

	<p pid="b.388.0/1">The introduction of the feed-in tariff came about after a long campaign by the parties now in Government and by many people out in the community who had seen the gains that had been made in Germany. We keep coming back to the German example. I am sure that any German people watching this debate will feel very smug that much of it is about what they have achieved there. I was a member of the Environment and Climate Change Committee during the previous Parliament, and we went over there to look what had been achieved in Baden-W&#252;rttemburg and Freiburg, as well as in Stuttgart, where the panels were being produced.</p>
	<p pid="b.388.0/2">Labour Members on the Committee&#8212;who at that time were Government Members&#8212;were very impressed but despairing that their party would not listen. I remember the debates in this place when the feed-in tariff was raised repeatedly, and some Labour Back Benchers were bravely standing up and defying the Whips to argue for it. We have to remember that were it not for what happened in another place we would not have made the progress towards the feed-in tariff that we have. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40206" name="Caroline Flint">The right hon.

	<p pid="b.388.2/2">We now have the feed-in tariff in operation. As a Member of Parliament for Cornwall, where there are huge possibilities for the solar industry and fantastic</p>
	<p pid="b.388.2/3">community groups are coming together in the co-operative sector to drive this forward, I am very pleased that we have seen such growth. However, I am looking to Ministers to give a positive and consistent message on solar, because there is confusion out there, and that is damaging. The Secretary of State made a strong speech today setting out a clear direction. However, confidence has undoubtedly been affected by, as the Secretary of State would say, the success of the scheme, because there has been such a high take-up and high capacity.</p>

	<p pid="b.389.0/1">On that subject, does my hon.

	<p pid="b.389.1/1">That is the thrust of what has been said by several Government Members, and indeed Opposition Members, who have raised concerns. We accept the need to act, but we must ensure that there is now a consistent vision so that the message gets across.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.1/2">I am excited about the possibilities. I believe that in the longer term, the message will be much better in terms of how much will be added to the bills of those who cannot take advantage of feed-in tariffs, because we will see a break-up of the small oligopoly of the big six energy producers and there will be a far more dispersed system. That will ultimately provide more competition and drive down price. Clearly the Secretary of State has been looking at this economic model, and he has to consider how much money is in the budget. I advise him to continue to focus on costs being put on to other domestic bills. I think that we can be far more positive about the long-term implications of this policy for all energy bill payers. If we have a far more diverse mix, it will create further competition and drive down prices, or at least will resist the upward trend in prices that we have had because of the issues with fossil fuels.</p>

	<p pid="b.389.2/1">I ask the hon.

	<p pid="b.389.3/1">As for how I will vote, I have looked at the motion and I am waiting to hear the Government&#8217;s position in the summing up. I have a number of issues, such as the need for certainty and the effect of the cliff edge in December, which other hon. Members have talked about. That is the real problem for investors. It would be very welcome if, in looking at the consultation, the Government could come up with any means of tapering that effect, particularly to help the community schemes and social housing schemes that are considering exciting ways to involve tenants and whole communities in taking advantage of the scheme. Those are people who might not be able to do so on their own, because they are not capital-rich enough.</p>

I asked the Secretary of State earlier whether the tax taken from the big six and the reduction in the money for solar power are worth the 2,700 lives that will be lost this year owing to the Government&#8217;s energy policies, but he never answered me. I am willing to allow him to intervene if he wants to tell me that his policies are worth more than 2,700 lives. We all hear that deafening silence. The money that the Government get from the tax and from reducing solar energy will amount to 2,700 lives. That is what the Hills report says, and the Secretary of State agreed with me when he was questioned about it.</p>

	<p pid="b.391.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is completely misguided to quote the Hills report, which I commissioned because I want a real effort made to combat fuel poverty, which was not happening in the past few years; we saw fuel poverty increase under the Labour Government. He is quite wrong to say that I am not concerned about the big six. We want a competitive market.

	<p pid="b.391.2/1">I can only use the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s own words. He told me that the Hills report said that 27,000 extra people would die this winter, and that 10% of those deaths would be down to the Government&#8217;s energy policies. That will be in <i>Hansard</i> for hon. Members to read for themselves. I asked him whether lives were worth more than the tax money, and he never answered me.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.2/2">At the end of the day, people will make the difference. The Government cannot be trusted. If people cannot trust the Government or what they are saying, how can they move forward? There lies the biggest problem. The 13,500 pensioners who are approaching fuel poverty in my constituency, and the disabled people who need extra help, will not be able to work out whether they can trust the Government to see them through this winter. Everything that has been mentioned is for next year, not this winter, but we need to solve the problems this winter.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.2/3">The money spent on solar power would have helped in the long term to keep people in jobs, to stimulate growth in industry and to get money circulating in the country, but the Government are cutting it. They want to halve the amount of money that would circulate. They want to halve everything. My hon. Friends the Members for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Sandra Osborne) and for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown) told us about their constituents who, through no fault of their own, will be caught up in this system and will find that they cannot afford what they thought they were going to get, although they did do their risk management.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.2/4">When the Secretary of State was having a go at my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway, I asked him how he knew that the person in question had not done a risk assessment or worked out the financial situation, and he replied, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t.&#8221; So there we have it: we have a Secretary of State who makes policy</p>
	<p pid="b.391.2/5">on the hoof and statements that contradict my hon. Friend, who knows his constituent and knows the situation, and says that my hon. Friend is wrong&#8212;and then, when asked from a sedentary position, &#8220;How do you know the constituent didn&#8217;t do that?&#8221; turns round and says, &#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t.&#8221; He is basically saying, &#8220;I just don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.391.2/6">We see it more and more. We have a Government who always use the excuse, &#8220;It&#8217;s somebody else&#8217;s fault. A big boy did it and ran away.&#8221; That is their modus operandi. That is what they do. It is always somebody else&#8217;s fault and never their fault, but unfortunately it is the people who Labour Members, in particular, represent who will suffer at the end of the day. I want to ensure that the 2,700 extra people who might die this winter do not, but the sad truth is that this Government do not care, and never will care. That is why the people on this side of the House are better than them.</p>

I agree that we should focus on the costs and budgets of ordinary people, but I have sympathy for the businesses that were lured to invest by the promise of unsustainable subsidies. I have neither sympathy nor respect for the Labour Ministers who set up the scheme knowing full well that the subsidies were unsustainable, and I deeply regret the fact that my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench, in the previous Parliament and this Parliament, took so long to recognise, at least partially, the folly of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/2">No one in this place has any excuse for failing to recognise that the subsidies were never remotely justified. The House insists that when a piece of legislation is published, we publish alongside it an impact assessment of the costs and benefits, so that the House will not be so foolish as to go ahead with a measure whose costs exceed its benefits.

	<p pid="b.392.2/1">Then the hon. Lady should be even more ashamed of supporting it. The impact assessment published by the Labour Government when the scheme was originally introduced calculated the net present value of the scheme&#8217;s future costs to be about &#163;8.6 billion, yet the Labour Government also measured the benefits of using solar rather than hydrocarbons and calculated the direct benefits in the shape of electricity and the indirect benefits&#8212;far more important&#8212;through the reduction in the damage caused by global warming owing to fewer CO2 emissions. They calculated that the net present value of all the future benefits, direct and indirect, compared with the costs of &#163;8.6 billion, would be just &#163;400 million. In other words, we knew when we introduced this scheme that the costs were 20 times the assessed benefits, but we went ahead anyway.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.2/2">I brought that fact to the attention of the House, but more importantly it was brought to the world&#8217;s attention by George Monbiot, a distinguished campaigner&#8212;unlike me&#8212;for measures to stop global warming, when he wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.392.2/3">&#8220;The government is about to shift &#163;8.6bn from the poor to the middle classes. It expects a loss on this scheme of &#163;8.2 billion, or 95%. Yet the media is silent. The opposition urges only that the scheme be expanded.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.392.2/4">We knew when we introduced the scheme that it would be nonsense even if it went according to plan. It was self-evidently unsustainable. Even halving it today means that we will merely waste &#163;4 billion, or 90% of the expected expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.2/5">When I have raised these issues, Ministers have employed two defences. The first is that the impact assessment excluded many knock-on effects. If it did they should have introduced a new one, because impact assessments are supposed to include all the indirect effects. It should not have been signed off by the hapless Minister, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. Then Ministers pray in aid the fact that the cost of solar energy is declining. They attribute that decline to the scheme, but none of it is due to the scheme, and the idea that our scheme will in any way accelerate the decline in costs worldwide is ridiculous. If something like Moore&#8217;s law does indeed apply, so that costs are likely to halve every couple of years, that is a reason for not investing now, but instead waiting until it is economic to do so, which will not be long. If we invest in expensive stuff when inexpensive stuff is going to be available in a few years, we are wasting money.</p>

	<p pid="b.393.0/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for the background information, which is especially useful for us new Members, who were not here when the policy was discussed previously. He is highlighting an extremely important point. The Government have only so much money to invest in new sustainable energy. It is all the more important to ensure that it is spent wisely, otherwise there will be no opportunity to bring other technologies to market.</p>

	<p pid="b.393.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and the argument that such investment creates jobs is&#8212;as the Secretary of State will know, being a distinguished economist&#8212;completely bogus. We have a fixed amount of money. We can either spend it on gas, oil or nuclear, or we can spend it on solar. If we spend &#163;8 billion on either, we will create roughly the same number of jobs. Spending &#163;8 billion on solar means that many fewer jobs in gas, nuclear, coal and oil. We have not created any net jobs across the economy by means of this subsidy. One never does.</p>

	<p pid="b.393.2/1">My right hon. Friend is making an extremely powerful speech. In addition to his point about the allocation of &#163;8 billion, is he aware of the recent peer-reviewed research from Imperial college&#8212;it was the subject of a Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology note&#8212;that said that nuclear power has one third the CO2 emissions per kWh of solar over its life cycle? That is an extraordinary statistic, which goes right to the heart of the policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.393.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. George Monbiot pointed out in his original article that it costs about &#163;3 to save a tonne of CO2 by investing in geothermal energy, and &#163;8 by building a nuclear power station, whereas the scheme that we are talking about costs more like &#163;800 to save a tonne of CO2.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.3/2">Not only do we not create any net jobs; we also create only a tenth of the amount of electricity by investing &#163;8 billion in solar than we would by investing in nuclear or something else.</p>

	<p pid="b.394.1/2">I will remind the House of something that may have escaped hon. Members&#8217; attention. Even if the price comes down dramatically, solar will never be a substitute for other forms of energy. It will always have to be backed up and duplicated by an equal amount of capacity that can perform when solar is not available. It may have escaped the notice of the House, but the sun comes out only in the day. It is not available at night, when it is coldest and we need most energy. The sun is highest in the sky in the summer; it is lowest in the winter, when it is coldest and we need most energy. The sun is often blocked by clouds, and one cannot predict when that will happen. For every megawatt of solar capacity that we install, we have to install an equal gas capacity to back it up and replicate it. Unless we realise that, and abandon the scheme until solar becomes much more economic, we are wasting the nation&#8217;s money and, as George Monbiot says, transferring money from poor people&#8217;s and ordinary people&#8217;s pockets into the hands of richer people.</p>

	<p pid="b.394.2/1">If ever there was an example of how not to make an announcement in this House, the announcement of the review of feed-in tariffs is it. The Government tried to slip it out as a written statement, but our ever-vigilant DECC team on the Opposition Front Bench recognised its importance, and managed to get a Minister to the Dispatch Box only by tabling an urgent question. The Government&#8217;s code of practice on consultations states that they should last 12 weeks, but this consultation is to last only six weeks, with the changes coming into force nearly two weeks before it finishes. Given the dearth of proposed legislation before the Chamber, I would have expected the Government to allow an oral statement and a full- day debate on the issue&#8212;not least to discuss the implied loss of jobs. It would be laughable if it were not so serious.</p>
	<p pid="b.394.2/2">The change will cost a lot of jobs in this sector, in which up to 30,000 people work. It will remove the opportunity for nine out of 10 households to take advantage of the feed-in tariff to reduce their energy bills at a time of rising fuel poverty. The <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase> deadline is causing planned solar projects nationwide to be shelved and millions of pounds of investment to be lost. A survey by the Renewable Energy Association reveals that 57% of companies now anticipate laying off at least half of their staff, while a third believe that their companies will go under.</p>
	<p pid="b.394.2/3">Let us take the example of Mr Wayne Richardson, one of my constituents who runs Revolution Power&#8212;a small renewable energy company employing 17 people. It has been on the go for about six years. Revolution Power fits photovoltaic units and provides ground and air heat pumps. Mr Richardson tells me that he might have to lay off a third of his staff. He is a young man</p>
	<p pid="b.394.2/4">with a young family; he is an entrepreneur and a trier. We need more Wayne Richardsons in the north-east to promote and protect jobs in the private sector.</p>

	<p pid="b.395.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that companies such as Romag&#8212;a major employer in my constituency that has been in the industry a long time and employs young people and young graduates in its research and development section&#8212;recognise the fact that feed-in tariffs are reducing, but are concerned about the shameful way in which this consultation has occurred and the very tight time scale? That is what is going to do them in.</p>

	<p pid="b.395.1/1">My hon. Friend is right. We all agree that the tariff has to come down, but how it is implemented is important. We need to think about the best way of protecting jobs, particularly in the north-east, where I want to see more private sector jobs available.</p>
	<p pid="b.395.1/2">Wayne Richardson agrees that the value of the feed-in tariff should be reduced, but the cack-handed way in which the Government have introduced this policy is hurting his company. The early reduction in the feed-in tariffs has created a vacuum in the market. As a consequence, parts and materials are in short supply, making it difficult for projects to be finished before <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.395.1/3">One reason behind the reduction is the falling price of installations. Because of the arbitrary deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase>, however, the price of equipment is going up. The number of inquiries about PV has decreased by 90%, which does not bode well for the future. The FITs scheme is paid for by a levy on energy companies, which is passed on to consumers and costs, as I understand it, only &#163;1 a year. We should compare that with the situation with wind farms. Eon wants to build 45 wind turbines in the constituency. The subsidy from the consumer in that case is close to &#163;200 a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.395.1/4">The FIT needs to be reduced, but not by 50% in seven weeks. In Germany, where 50% of all PV units are installed, the tariff was cut by 15% and it is being achieved step by step through negotiations and agreement with the industry. Plenty of time and notice has been allowed. I understand that reductions in the tariff there occur year on year so that the industry and consumers can plan ahead&#8212;something this Government are daily proving their inability to do. The fact that so little legislation is before the House proves to me that they have no plan and, I suspect, no future.</p>

	<p pid="b.395.2/1">Post-privatisation, more than a dozen utility companies provided a great deal of energy competition in this country. Sadly, under Labour, however, the energy market consolidated so that we now have, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40430" name="Dan Rogerson">the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> said, the big six. We also inherited feed-in tariffs in a shambles. It is my belief that the Government&#8217;s reform of FITs will protect our energy mix.</p>
	<p pid="b.395.2/2">As the Secretary of State has pointed out, installation costs of solar photovoltaics have fallen by at least 30% since the FITs scheme began. The Government are</p>
	<p pid="b.395.2/3">controlling the cost of the subsidy because the average installation is now around &#163;9,000&#8212;down from &#163;12,000&#8212;so the rate of return has shot up.</p>
	<p pid="b.395.2/4">If the Government&#8217;s proposed reforms are introduced, we will mirror Germany&#8217;s FITs subsidy levels from January onwards, while still spending &#163;867 million over four years. Money intended to support decentralised energy will not now subsidise energy-inefficient buildings under new energy efficiency requirements, which can only be a good thing. Solar will still be the most subsidised renewable technology, receiving twice the subsidy available for inshore wind. The Government&#8217;s changes will also protect consumer energy bills. Labour Members must tell us by how much they would be prepared to increase the average household&#8217;s energy bill in order to maintain high tariffs for solar. The amount might be as much as &#163;55 per household.</p>

	<p pid="b.396.0/1">My hon. Friend is making some powerful points. It is true that we must make feed-in tariffs more sustainable, although, like many other Members who have spoken, I have concerns about the proposed time scales. Is this not about making the system fairer&#8212;fairer for those who are already signed up and going through the process, but also, as my hon. Friend says, fairer for households that are struggling with high energy bills?</p>

	<p pid="b.396.1/1">I agree, but I believe that the consultation timetable is reasonable. I think that people will have time to plan and prepare, and to register installations that are currently under way. In September, 16,000 solar photovoltaic installations were registered, double the number registered in June. There are now 100,000 installations nationally, three times as many as were projected, and the costs of solar PV have fallen by at least a third since the FITs scheme began.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.1/2">The scheme was designed to encourage deployment of additional small-scale low-carbon electricity generation, particularly by organisations, businesses, communities and individuals who had not traditionally been engaged in the electricity market, many of them in our constituencies. The Government rightly announced the largest reduction in tariffs for the large-scale solar projects. The Government&#8217;s proposed FITs reductions for domestic solar energy installations are out for public consultation until <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-23">23 December</phrase>, and are due to come in to effect in April next year. I believe that that is a sensible time scale, and I hope that the Secretary of State will consider carefully the submissions he receives.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.1/3">The Government are right to address payments for FITs from more than one PV installation located on different sites under single ownership. I am thinking of the likes of Asda, which was mentioned earlier. I think that 80% of the full subsidy is a sensible level. The scheme we inherited from Labour was based on wildly inaccurate projections and participation, and therefore on entirely unrealistic financial assumptions. Any programme in any Department must be sustainable and based on realistic finances. Without urgent action, the whole FITs budget would be swallowed up by solar alone within months, depriving other renewable technologies of support through FITs. Microgeneration, for instance, is a key part of the energy mix that we will need for future energy security. The FITs subsidy cannot go disproportionately to solar.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.1/4">Each week beyond <phrase class="date" code="2011-04-01">1 April</phrase> next year on the old subsidy tariff would cost more than &#163;500,000 per day, or about &#163;3.8 million per week. While &#163;867 million over four years is a sustainable subsidy, more than that would be unsustainable. None of these changes is retrospective, and fairness is therefore being safeguarded. There has been a big fall in solar PV costs, and a big increase in the rate of return. That will exhaust the FITs budget unless it is urgently addressed. The rate of return needs to be reduced from 12% to 5%. The irony is that Labour wants millions of families in fuel poverty to subsidise a few thousand well-off people with solar panels by adding up to &#163;55 a year to the average bill, with no reform of the feed-in tariff.</p>

	<p pid="b.397.2/3">&#8220;The Government needs to rethink&#8230;There could be considerable impact on jobs in North Wales as local electricians as well as local producers for solar panels are preparing to deal with the impact of cancelled orders for work. In Wrexham, major housing projects which included provision for Feed-in Tariffs are now at risk because of the UK Government&#8217;s decision.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.397.4/1">I entirely agree.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.4/2">Sharp Solar was mentioned earlier. It has made it clear that big contracts, such as that with Wrexham council to install solar panels on 3,000 council houses, are now in doubt. The 900 installations completed before the <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase> deadline are safe, but no decision has been made on whether the others will go ahead. The</p>
	<p pid="b.397.4/3">stock for that work had to be ordered several months ago, however, and Sharp Solar is now stuck with it no matter what happens.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.4/4">All the political parties agree that there had to be changes, but the changes could have been made in a way that was manageable, and a proper notice period could have been provided. The Government could have got businesses on their side in order to make the changes work. Instead, we have a total mess.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.4/5">Businesses have tried to tell the Government about the problems the changes will cause them. Wrexham council leaders wrote to the Government to tell them about the impact of the <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase> deadline on their scheme. They received a reply inviting them to respond to the consultation, but that response will be read only after the deadline has passed. That is totally shambolic.

	<p pid="b.398.2/1">Exactly. However, I do agree with the hon. Gentleman that this debate is about people. We are talking about our constituents: those who generate energy, those who consume energy, and those who are innovators in the industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.2/2">We have all been diligent constituency MPs this afternoon and have mentioned a number of constituents who have contacted us to say they are affected by this issue. I could talk about Mr and Mrs Willett, who have agreed to install a photovoltaic system with an installation date of <phrase class="date" code="2012-01-09">9 January 2012</phrase>. I could talk about the company PG Plumbing and Heating Ltd in my constituency; it wants me to put a question to the Minister, and I will come back to that. I could talk about Loughborough Solar Technologies, which has contacted me, or the company C Gascoigne, which I mentioned when I asked the Minister a question earlier. I could also mention SmartGen. I thought I should mention all of them so that they can say, &#8220;Yes, she&#8217;s done what she should do as our constituency MP.&#8221; They are all affected by this decision, and they all have questions for the Minister. However, the key point is that this is ultimately about people&#8212;about people when they come to pay their energy bills, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40211" name="Chris Kelly">the Member for Dudley South (Chris Kelly)</phrase> said.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.2/3">All the political parties have agreed that there was a need for change. The feed-in tariff scheme as left to us by the previous Government did not add up. The shadow Secretary of State said there would have been a review, but as the Secretary of State pointed out, the last Government had not planned to undertake that review until 2013, which would have been too late.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.2/4">What do we disagree on? Who is at fault. Is the need for change the fault of consumers who are prepared to generate energy and who wanted to install solar panels? Is it the fault of the companies that have taken advantage of the generous scheme that was on offer? No, the fact</p>
	<p pid="b.398.2/5">that we are having to change the scheme and affect the constituents who have contacted me as well as many others is the fault of the previous Government, who left us with a wholly unsustainable system.</p>

	<p pid="b.399.1/1">I am not going to take any interventions. I have been asked to be brief and it is only fair that I should be so that other hon. Members can speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.1/2">This is the fault of the previous Government and the one word that was missing, as always, from the shadow Secretary of State&#8217;s speech&#8212;as it is from those of any shadow Secretary of State&#8212;was the word &#8220;sorry&#8221;. She should have said sorry to those consumers who face higher bills, who thought they had agreed things and who are now having to deal with the date of the cut-off and the changes to the tariff.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.1/3">The House needs to discuss how to ensure that there is a sustainable system so that we have certainty for tariffs. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40318" name="Peter Lilley">the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley)</phrase> said, it is not the Government&#8217;s role to support bubbles. Unfortunately, when we are left a bubble by the previous Government, this Government have to burst it. We have to face the realities of the situation and we will potentially get it in the neck, as we have with the other decisions we have had to take, for dealing with the mess left to us by them.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.1/4">I have some points for clarification. First, will the Minister confirm whether the cut-off date in December is the date of installation or the date when the application for the tariff has been processed? Secondly, I and other Members would appreciate some explanation of how the consultation dates work. Obviously, we have been given the date of <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase> and the consultation closes after that. It is worth addressing that point. Finally, I mentioned the company Loughborough Solar Technologies, which would appreciate a clear commitment from the Government to the industry&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.399.3/1">Like so many others, I am deeply concerned by the Government&#8217;s proposals for green energy and the devastating impact the cuts to feed-in tariffs could have on thousands of jobs within my constituency and across Britain, not to mention the sheer irony as the Government renege on their commitment to be the greenest Government ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.3/2">In the past year, nearly 200 families within my council boundary have installed solar power. It is a great way for people to make their homes greener and more efficient and to protect themselves from soaring energy prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.399.4/1">I must point out that although Opposition Members are talking about the total collapse of this industry, households will, on average, get &#163;500 tax-free every year. That might not be &#163;1,000, but it is an extraordinary incentive to companies to sell and households to purchase solar panel products.</p>

	<p pid="b.400.0/1">I am glad that the hon. Lady made her point but, if she does not mind, I shall continue to make mine.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.0/2">Skyline, a local company in my constituency, made representations to me over the weekend. In partnership with the AVC Group, Skyline has recently opened a brand-new purpose-built premises in Shawhead in Coatbridge. The managing director, Mr Robert Bell, explained to me:</p>
	<p pid="b.400.0/3">&#8220;In this new venture Skyline in partnership with the AVC Group are now introducing solar energy sales, installation and advice to our existing business. A new trade counter will be available covering all aspects of aerials, satellite and renewable energy products.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.0/4">Skyline and the AVC Group share the new premises. This will help consolidate our main business activities and help Skyline to secure more jobs for local people.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.0/5">Our training facility will also be used by external companies seeking to train their employees in ladder training at special heights underpinned with customer care.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.400.0/6">The level of entrepreneurship exhibited in my constituency is, quite simply, being placed at risk by the Government. Not only are the Government proposing to cut feed-in tariffs by half so that demand for solar power is reduced by a staggering 92%, they want to do so retrospectively. That means that people with businesses who have already invested in solar power will have to abandon their schemes if they cannot afford the new rate.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.0/7">I suspect that councils up and down the country will have to pull the plug on thousands of solar panel installations for social housing and community projects. We have heard evidence of that this afternoon. I wrote to the chief executive of north Lanarkshire council and a variety of housing associations in an effort to establish the extent of the Government&#8217;s cuts to solar power. It is clear that the new regulations imposed by the Government alongside the tariff reduction will make solar energy inaccessible to most people in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.400.1/1">One issue to be addressed is that of customers who find themselves halfway through a contract and who will not now get solar power. They will be betwixt and between because they will not have the opportunity of getting that solar power up and running. Is that not a major issue that the Government have not looked at in the consultation?</p>

	<p pid="b.400.2/1">My hon. Friend makes his point very effectively, and earlier our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40429" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark)</phrase> highlighted what he has just said.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.2/2">The <i>Financial Times</i> today reported that the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change is considering</p>
	<p pid="b.400.2/3">&#8220;new limits...on subsidies for households that install renewable energy...as he looks to defuse anger&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.400.2/4">about the cuts. I only hope that his words translate into action, as the Government&#8217;s own impact assessment reveals that nine out of 10 households will be locked out of the solar energy market. How can that be justified by the so-called greenest Government ever? I will continue to oppose the devastating impact of their attack on feed-in tariffs and I shall fight for a fairer deal for the people of my constituency who are finding it very difficult to cope with rising energy prices. Yes, the solar industry does need to be regulated and, yes, reductions in tariffs do need to be made as energy becomes cheaper,</p>
	<p pid="b.400.2/5">but not on this scale and not so that it is essentially wiped out as an alternative for the average household and small business. It cannot be right that the Government are hitting people who are trying to do the right thing by cutting their energy bills. Their proposals for feed-in tariffs will hit families, put thousands of jobs at risk and devastate the solar industry. That is the reality of what we are debating. The Liberal Democrats once again find themselves between a rock and a hard place as the Government plough ahead with irresponsible cuts that strike at the very heart of what we are told were their core beliefs. If the coalition Government truly strive to be the greenest Government ever, they cannot seriously expect the public to stand by as the solar industry is cut down in its prime&#8212;just as the number of companies operating in solar has risen from 350 to 4,000 and as clean energy jobs have soared from 3,000 to 30,000 since 2010. That would simply be unsustainable and unacceptable, certainly to my constituents and the small companies in my constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.401.1/1">I should very much like to ask the Minister to clarify the situation regarding the tariffs and whether they will be retrospective. Mid Devon council in my constituency has 1,800 homes on which it wants to put solar panels. Two thirds of those people are on housing benefit and they would get the benefit of &#163;3 a week off their electricity bill, so I am very concerned about the retrospective side of the tariff.</p>

	<p pid="b.401.4/1">I am sorry, I will press on so that more Members can speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.4/2">I am concerned that we should not use up all our resources, as we need to support emerging technologies. It is vital that we do not spend all the money on FITs for PVs. The Government have introduced a wide range of really good policies that support the emergence of new technologies in my constituency. For example, recent investment by the regional growth fund in deep geothermal engineering will leverage in &#163;42 million of private sector investment, alongside nearly &#163;1.5 million from the Department of Energy and Climate Change to create the first deep geothermal power station in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.4/3">That is a sustainable and inexpensive way of producing energy, and DECC has estimated that it could produce up to 10% of the electricity that the UK needs. That is a very good investment, and the Government are to be congratulated, at a time when there are limited resources, as that deep geothermal energy plant will create thousands of jobs in the company and up to 9,000 jobs in the supply chain around Cornwall for the development of that new and exciting technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.4/4">I very much welcome the fact that, this winter, the renewable heat incentive will be made available to commercial businesses and a limited number of consumers installing ground heat pumps and other sources of renewable heat. I hope that, through that work, lessons will be learned so that we can end the debacle that we inherited with FITs. The renewable heat incentive will play an enormously important role in our energy security and in making sure that people switch to sustainable, green energy sources, so I hope that it does its job and works well.</p>

	<p pid="b.402.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to pay tribute to Alan Simpson, the former Labour MP who tabled the amendment that led to the legislation on FITs. I am sad that the present Administration have succumbed to the lobbying power of the big six energy companies by taking the first step in the erosion of FITs in this country. Government Members have mentioned Germany, which has a strong FITs system, and its tariffs led to far lower energy prices than we have in this country. FITs are about where the power is, and one of their impacts is to transfer power from the energy companies to individuals&#8212;to the consumer&#8212;and to communities. That is why I am sad that the Government have introduced these proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.402.1/1">On a very important point of fact, energy prices in Germany are not lower.

	<p pid="b.402.2/1">As the Minister will be aware, energy prices in Germany are at the levels they were in 2008, which is a very different situation from the one we are in. Opposition spokespeople have already spoken about the bills that individuals and businesses have to face under this Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.2/2">The Government are rushing to introduce their proposal, which will cause havoc for all the reasons outlined by many Opposition Members and, indeed, by some Government Members, because they chose to put a ceiling on the solar FIT budget. That was not the position under the previous Government. Will Ministers explain whether they have looked at surpluses in other renewable energy budgets, and ask the Treasury if they can use those budgets to ensure that more money is available for solar, given the runaway success of the scheme?</p>

	<p pid="b.403.0/1">My hon. Friend puts a powerful case. Perhaps Government Members should read the Opposition motion before them. There is acceptance on both sides of the House and within the renewable energy industry, both among consumers and among those who manufacture and install the equipment, that a review of the tariff rates is needed. The problem with the Government&#8217;s proposals is the short notice, which has come about because of the rules that the Government created for themselves. I therefore ask the Government to withdraw the arbitrary <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase> deadline and introduce more measured proposals. If Government Members agree with that, the only option available to them this evening is to vote for the Opposition motion.</p>
	<p pid="b.403.0/2">We have heard a lot from the Government about their being the greenest Government ever, but the proposal that we are discussing shows what a lie that is. The only way to bring renewable energy into mass use in this country, with the economies of scale that make it a viable option for most people, is by providing incentives now for those who are leading the trail. We need a Government with vision, who are committed to developing our renewable energy industry and to combating climate change.</p>
	<p pid="b.403.0/3">The only way for the Government to achieve those aims is to commit themselves fully to feed-in tariffs and to create a regime that ensures certainty in the market, so that the financial sector, both in the private and the public sectors, knows that it can invest in renewables because there is certainty about the deal on the table. Such a regime will ensure that we have a green Government and a green Britain. I urge the Government to show vision and to re-examine their proposals.</p>

	<p pid="b.403.1/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to contribute to an important and complex debate. The issue has a significant impact on Montgomeryshire. I know that many other Members have received communications from people who are concerned about the changes to the feed-in tariff.</p>
	<p pid="b.403.1/2">The core issue is the tension between desirable objectives. On the one hand, we seek to tackle the carbon emissions that threaten our planet through climate change, and renewable energy is a significant part of that. On the other hand, we have to look after consumers. We heard earlier about the impact on the poorest people in society, because the subsidy has to be paid by consumers. That includes probably millions of people who are already suffering fuel poverty. It would be irresponsible of the Government not to consider those who might be driven into fuel poverty if they adopted a cavalier approach towards the subsidy required for the feed-in tariff as it was.</p>
	<p pid="b.403.1/3">The Government remain committed to a variety of energy sources. Nuclear is clearly an important part of that. Renewables have a big part to play&#8212;tidal, possibly</p>
	<p pid="b.403.1/4">shale gas, offshore wind and even solar. Just because there is a change in the regime, I do not believe that solar will be put on the back burner at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.403.1/5">The problem with feed-in tariffs for solar PV is that they have been far more successful than anybody ever anticipated. A number of Members have mentioned that today. Three times as many applications have gone ahead as could have reasonably been expected. In September alone there were 16,000 new applications. We saw the graph that the Secretary of State showed us earlier&#8212;it looked like a hockey stick. If action had not been taken now, the whole tariff scheme would have become completely unsustainable.</p>

	<p pid="b.404.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that not only would the FIT scheme become untenable, but the jobs created in the short term through the gold rush to get into the marketplace would quickly evaporate? What we want is long-term, sustainable jobs, hence the need to bring the FIT down.</p>

	<p pid="b.404.1/1">I very much agree with my hon. Friend; it is a point I made in an earlier intervention. I thought that the Secretary of State&#8217;s reference to a Catherine-wheel was a wonderful analogy. A quick burst followed by a reduction in the number of jobs in the long run as a result of not doing something about the scheme would be entirely negative. Any scheme must be sustainable, and the problem with the scheme as it stood was that it was completely unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="b.404.1/2">When I first heard about the predicted change, I was as concerned as anyone, which is why I listened to the Secretary of State&#8217;s statement very carefully. Afterwards, I understood that the Government had absolutely no choice but to go forward with the changes they have made. That is the only way the scheme can be sustainable in the long term. The issue is the timetable. I was greatly relieved that he pointed out in his contribution that there is a consultation period.

	<p pid="b.404.2/1">We have had an important debate and a number of significant points have been made by many hon. Members despite their speaking for a limited time. My hon. Friends the Members for Ynys M&#244;n (Albert Owen), for Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Sandra Osborne), for Glasgow North West (John Robertson), for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson) and for Clwyd South (Susan Elan Jones), my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40179" name="Tom Clarke">the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr Clarke)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40429" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark)</phrase>, among other Members, made important points about the Government&#8217;s changes to the feed-in tariff. We could no doubt have had a somewhat longer debate had time not been curtailed by the Secretary of State&#8217;s lengthy urgent statement earlier this afternoon and his lengthy speech at the start of the debate, but I want to keep my remarks as brief as possible to enable the Minister to respond. A number of important issues have been raised and I am sure that he wants to respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.404.2/2">The Minister is a politician that many of us have come to appreciate, especially in his recent works, as a master of his art. The reduction in the feed-in tariff</p>
	<p pid="b.404.2/3">&#8220;effectively slowly suffocates the growth that the policy has so far encouraged.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.404.2/4">Not my words but those of the Minister&#8217;s close colleague, Boris Johnson, the Mayor of London.</p>
	<p pid="b.404.2/5">&#8220;Industry trust and confidence in the government has evaporated.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.404.2/6">Again, not my words but those of the CBI. The new rates mean</p>
	<p pid="b.404.2/7">&#8220;that unless you have significant savings, you&#8217;re unlikely to be able to afford solar panels&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.404.2/8">Once more, not my words, but those of Friends of the Earth. The ability to build such a consensus against his own policy is a formidable feat on which I congratulate the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="b.404.2/9">I would also like to pay tribute to the Minister&#8217;s transformational skills. In a few short weeks, he has managed to turn a policy that was admired, appreciated and effective into a shambles that is mired in confusion, contradiction and potential legal challenge. However, he is a man of great foresight and has the extraordinary ability to set a consultation with an effective date close to two weeks before the close of the consultation. It is a remarkable record from a remarkable Minister. I can only look on in awe and wonderment at his abilities and only aspire never quite to plump those depths myself.</p>

	<p pid="b.405.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the issue for the consumer is not the &#163;1 each that the feed-in tariffs will cost, but the fact that the Government have clearly and demonstrably failed to tackle the big six energy companies that are taking massive and obscene profits from the British consumer?</p>

	<p pid="b.405.1/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. When the Minister, as he is about to do, following the example of the Secretary of State, makes points about consumer bills and compares the &#163;1 cost with the &#163;1,345 for the average annual bill, which is 0.08%&#8212;less than a tenth of 1%&#8212;I think that the figures speak for themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.405.4/1">I am afraid I am going to make some progress, because I want to give the Minister time to respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.405.4/2">The Government have endangered an industry in its very infancy and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Ynys M&#244;n made clear, sent to the rest of industry a signal that is doing the UK a lot of damage. It suggests that we cannot rely on what the Government say because they will change their position with scant consultation, no planning and in an arbitrary way. As E.ON said only yesterday,</p>
	<p pid="b.405.4/3">&#8220;this sort of action creates uncertainty for business, and will have a negative impact&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.405.4/4">The Minister has argued that there is a pressing need to reduce costs, that installation costs have fallen and that the subsidy must follow, and, despite the Secretary of State&#8217;s best attempt to muddy the waters earlier, no one argues with that&#8212;not the solar industry, not consumer organisations and not the Opposition. Indeed, it might take him six months to answer his correspondence, but, as he well knows, trade bodies have argued for months</p>
	<p pid="b.405.4/5">that there should be a sensible, structured reduction in the subsidy&#8212;not a jump off the landing, but a walk down the stairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.405.4/6">The Government&#8217;s consultation states that installation costs have reduced by 30%, but it is no good the Minister getting to his feet and citing the cost of panels in isolation from other costs as a way of justifying the 70% figure from Bloomberg, because, if installation costs have reduced by 30%, why is the tariff being cut by 52% in one go? Perhaps, as he has claimed before, it is part of his cunning plan to cut energy bills, but, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40451" name="Pat Glass">the Member for North West Durham (Pat Glass)</phrase> has made clear, that attempt will just not work.</p>

	<p pid="b.406.0/1">Will the hon. Gentleman give way?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.406.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40514" speakername="Tom Greatrex" colnum="406"  time="018:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0004.htm#11112385004295">
	<p pid="b.406.1/1">I will make a little more progress and then I may be able to give way. I am conscious of the time and of the Minister needing to respond.</p>
	<p pid="b.406.1/2">The important point is that the Government&#8217;s policy will also cost: it will cost some of the 25,000 jobs; it will cost some of the 3,000 businesses; and it will cost people&#8217;s confidence in the UK as a place to invest. It is shameful to pull the plug on one of the few industries providing growth and jobs, which are nowhere else in the economy, for the sake of &#163;1 a year on a bill. It is short-sighted to put at risk 25,000 jobs and, thereby, reduce tax revenues and increase benefit payments for &#163;1 a year. Throughout the country it will cost community projects, which are being cancelled, co-operative models that are being developed, social housing schemes and people&#8217;s sense of involvement in electricity generation in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.406.1/3">It would be unfair of me to suggest that the Minister, as much as he has united people in opposition to the policy, is without friends. He has a very supportive Secretary of State, with a burgeoning reputation for collegiate behaviour in government and loyalty to his colleagues. He is also known to dabble in Twitter, so I am sure he has made the Minister aware that there is, indeed, a SaveGregBarker Twitter feed. It has 18 followers, but perhaps it will have some more after today&#8217;s debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.406.1/4">There are more than 18 of the Secretary of State&#8217;s hon. Friends who have expressed concern at his Department&#8217;s action on feed-in tariffs. However, some 24 Liberal Democrats have signed early-day motion 673, which states that</p>
	<p pid="b.406.1/5">&#8220;the feed-in tariff scheme will provide much needed stability for the expansions of renewables up to&#8230;2013.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.406.2/1">The Labour motion before us turns on its penultimate line, which refers to &#8220;more measured proposals&#8221;. Members from all parts of the House want a more sustainable solution than the current one, but what are these &#8220;more measured proposals&#8221; and how they are going to be paid for?</p>

	<p pid="b.406.3/1">The hon. Gentleman, as a signatory to early-day motion 673, has expressed his concern about those issues, and I will go on to make a couple of remarks about what we need to do next, following his support for the motion before us and that of his colleagues who signed the early-day motion.</p>
	<p pid="b.406.3/2">Indeed, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40388" name="John Leech">the hon. Member for Manchester, Withington (Mr Leech)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, was quoted on the Friends of the Earth website last week, saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.406.3/3">&#8220;Solar has been the real success story...We can&#8217;t afford to jeopardise thousands of jobs by slashing the feed in tariff and creating uncertainty, giving the industry no time to adjust.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.406.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" name="Norman Baker">The hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>, a Minister no less, says on his website that he has concerns</p>
	<p pid="b.406.3/5">&#8220;about the speed and level of the proposed changes for community size projects and I am therefore asking the Secretary of State to examine urgently the case for some flexibility&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.406.3/6">The Secretary of State&#8217;s own Parliamentary Private Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40168" name="Duncan Hames">the hon. Member for Chippenham (Duncan Hames)</phrase>, quoted in the <i>Financial Times </i>this morning, said that we should look at the German model of gradually reducing support rather than, as I described it earlier, jumping off the cliff.</p>
	<p pid="b.406.3/7">If all those friends of the Secretary of State want to be friends to the Government&#8212;I understand their desire, however misguided, to support the Government; if they want to get the Government to right their mistakes; if they want to repair some of the damage of the past few weeks; if they want a sustainable and sensible model for support going forward; if they want to walk down the stairs rather than jump off the landing; if, perhaps, they want to &#8220;SaveGregBarker&#8221;, they must vote for the motion this evening. They should look at the wording of the motion, which is about having a sustainable, sensible, gradual approach rather than making a sudden cut that is putting people, jobs and businesses in jeopardy and leaving consumers high and dry. Let us help rescue the Government from the mess that they have made for themselves, and support the motion this evening.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.407.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40077" speakername="Gregory Barker" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change"  colnum="407"  time="018:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0004.htm#11112385004298">
	<p pid="b.407.0/1">I believe in the huge potential of solar. Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40530" name="Mark Spencer">the Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer)</phrase>, who made an excellent speech, I believe it is a terrific technology. It is intuitive, dynamic, attractive to consumers and easy to install, and I am determined to see it at the heart of the coalition&#8217;s ambitious plans to bring decentralised energy to millions of Britain&#8217;s homes, communities and businesses. What is more, unlike <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40206" name="Caroline Flint">the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint)</phrase>, I campaigned for it, voted for it and genuinely believe in it.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/2">However, for those of us who are passionately committed to the green agenda, there are two great threats in these difficult economic times. First, and obviously, there are the climate change deniers, but secondly, and I think even more dangerously at the moment, there are the deficit deniers. There is no greater bunch of deficit-denying opportunists than Opposition Front Benchers, who seem to think that the green economy lives in a vacuum, immune to the economic realities confronting every other sector of the British economy and to the impact that that has on consumer bills.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/3">The fact is that Labour was wrong to vote against feed-in tariffs in November 2008. It was also wrong to introduce them in April 2010 without any budgetary control mechanism at all, and wrong to ignore lessons from the successful FITs model in Germany. It was wrong to ignore totally the potentially huge impact that FITs could have on the fuel-poor in particular, and catastrophically wrong earlier this year when it insisted that our early review of large-scale feed-in tariffs would</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/4">butcher the entire UK solar industry. In fact, following that statement by the Labour Front Benchers, the deployment of solar technology has risen by more than 300%, and it has risen more than tenfold since the beginning of the year. The statistics are staggering.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/5">No wonder Which? has stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/6">&#8220;It&#8217;s right that the Government properly controls spending on Feed-in Tariffs as everyone pays for this scheme through their energy bills.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/7">No wonder the chief executive of Consumer Focus has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/8">&#8220;The Government is taking a sensible approach to protect energy bill-payers with the proposed changes to Feed-in Tariffs. Incentives to overcome the high set-up cost of solar panels and help make our energy supply greener are necessary. But the cost for this is passed onto bills of energy customers and we need to strike a balance.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/9">That is exactly what we need to do&#8212;strike a sensible balance between our high ambition for decentralised energy and recognising the costs of what is still the most expensive to support of the whole array of decentralised technologies.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/10">Unfortunately, Opposition Front Benchers bury their heads in the sand. The notion that spending billions on solar would cost no more than &#163;1 on people&#8217;s bills is from cloud cuckoo land. They clearly have not yet got up to speed with their brief. They will know from the impact assessment that we published in September that the central estimate is that it would add &#163;28 to bills every year by 2020. Since then the estimate has risen again, and the higher estimate is &#163;55. We now know, given the level of deployment in October, that if we did not act now it would add up to &#163;80 to everybody&#8217;s electricity bills.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/11">Tell that to the 5.5 million people whom Labour left in fuel poverty. Let us not dwell on the fact that Labour cannot add up and are a bunch of deficit deniers. We know that because of the state they left the economy in.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.0/12">Some very sensible comments have been made in this debate, and I am very grateful to all colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="b.408.0/1">On the impact assessment that the Minister himself carried out, does he accept that the &#163;26 is relevant only if the tariff at its present level continues until 2015, which was never the scheme&#8217;s intention in the first place, on anybody&#8217;s reckoning?

	<p pid="b.408.2/1">I am afraid that the hon. Gentleman is wrong. The impact assessment relates to no change until April next year, and then there will be degression, as planned by the Leader of the Opposition when he was in government and set up this poorly conceived scheme last year. So, as I say, I am afraid that he is incorrect on that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.408.2/2">We have had some extremely sensible contributions. The one from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40408" name="Glyn Davies">the Member for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies)</phrase>, in which he flagged up the impact that the scheme will have on not only fuel bills but the fuel-poor, was absolutely right. Too often</p>
	<p pid="b.408.2/3">the voice of the fuel-poor is distorted. Yes, it is great for the few thousand who may benefit from solar panels in social housing, but what about the other 5.5 million whom Labour left in fuel poverty, who will not benefit but would still face the prospect of &#163;80 on their electricity bills? Go and tell the other 5.5 million people who will be left out how they are going to find the extra &#163;80 if we do not act now.</p>
	<p pid="b.408.2/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40211" name="Chris Kelly">the Member for Dudley South (Chris Kelly)</phrase> was spot-on in his analysis and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40376" name="Nicky Morgan">the Member for Loughborough (Nicky Morgan)</phrase> was right. I am afraid there is absolutely no sign of anything that even looks like a &#8220;Sorry&#8221; from Opposition Front Benchers for the mess they made of setting up the scheme. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40616" name="Sarah Newton">the Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton)</phrase> was right: we need to learn the lessons from Labour&#8217;s failed scheme, particularly because although the feed-in tariff scheme supports solar, it also supports a whole range of other technologies. We must not forget that. We want a diverse, innovation-rich, decentralised energy economy, and there is a lot more to the feed-in tariff scheme than solar alone, important though that is.</p>
	<p pid="b.408.2/5">My hon. Friend the Member for Sherwood made excellent points about Germany. He was spot-on when he said that we need to pull solar into the mainstream of the green economy, rather than leaving it as a bubble in a silo at one side. That is why the launch of the green deal will bring solar into the mainstream. That is a very exciting proposition. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40430" name="Dan Rogerson">The hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan Rogerson)</phrase> also made some excellent points, and I share the view that we need to have a consistent regime. [Hon. Members: &#8220; They&#8217;re all on your side.&#8221;] <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40514" name="Tom Greatrex">The hon. Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex)</phrase> listed and spoke at length to Opposition contributions. I have very limited time, so I am going to mention those from my hon. Friends first.</p>
	<p pid="b.408.2/6">However, I recognise that there is genuine concern about the implementation of the reference date of <phrase class="date" code="2011-12-12">12 December</phrase>, and that it will be a real challenge for a lot of companies. We did not do this lightly. We have had to move quickly in order to protect the budget. Unfortunately, if we had not done so we would have had to do what Labour did in the past and close the scheme completely. We will not do that. We are protecting the scheme for the long term and for sustainability. This is a genuine consultation. We are constrained by the budget and by demand, which is going through the roof, but at the same time, I am listening carefully to the many sensible representations&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.413.2/6" class="italic">Resolved,</p>
	<p pid="b.413.2/7">That this House notes that the previous administration only introduced a feed-in tariffs scheme following pressure from Liberal Democrat and Conservative hon. Members; further notes that during the period up to October 2011 over 120,000 UK solar installations had been completed; further notes that this is three times the deployment expected by the previous administration; recognises that no commercial-scale solar PV schemes were expected by the previous administration; further notes that the cost of PV panels has fallen by at least 30 per cent. since the current tariff was introduced and that the previous administration set the tariff levels for solar PV to deliver a five per cent. index-linked return;</p>
	<p pid="b.413.2/8">regrets that the previous administration did not draw on the experiences of Germany in setting a sustainable and predictable digression of tariffs; further notes that failing to act could add &#163;26 to the domestic electricity bill of all consumers in 2020 including the 5.5 million people left in fuel poverty by the previous administration; further regrets that the previous administration did not introduce a community tariff; believes that the Government is right to bring the tariff levels back in line with the rates of return envisaged; acknowledges that it is right to link support under feed-in tariffs to energy efficiency and the Green Deal ensuring the most cost-effective carbon abatement measures are introduced first; supports a consultation on the introduction of a community tariff; and further believes that the Government is putting feed-in tariffs on a long-term, fair and sustainable footing.</p>

	<p pid="b.418.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. Something happened to one of my constituents today that is of fundamental importance, I believe, to all hon. Members regarding constituents&#8217; access to Parliament. My constituent attended a Palestine lobby, similar to one she has attended on many previous occasions, but on this occasion things were different. As she arrived at security, a police officer confiscated her lobby briefing material and told her that she was not allowed to have anything of a political nature. In fact, she was told that this was a direction from the House authorities. The officer then spoke to a senior officer, who gave the same response. Eventually, the material was returned to her, but she was told, &#8220;Yes, we will return this material, but do not do this again.&#8221; I ask your advice, Mr Deputy Speaker. Was this a direction from the House authorities? Will you confirm that constituents are not allowed to have anything of a political nature with them when they attend Parliament?</p>

	<p pid="b.418.1/1">This is a matter for the staff and the police. The hon. Gentleman will know that we do not discuss security issues or what has gone on as a matter of security, but he has put his views on the record. I am sure that the authorities and security will look into the matter, and I am sure that someone will come back to the hon. Gentleman now that he has raised it on the Floor of the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.419.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" speakername="Guy Opperman" colnum="419"  time="019:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0004.htm#11112385005348">
	<p pid="b.419.2/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter in the House. Bowel cancer affects men and women, and it is the second-highest killer after lung cancer. The debate is, I suggest, both timely and genuinely needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/2">I have personal experience of the NHS that is probably too long to list. When I was a jockey, I was saved by a gastro-surgeon at Warwick hospital. I hoped I was riding the winner at Stratford races, but we turned over and the horse ruptured my spleen, perforated my left kidney and broke nine bones in my ribs. I can assure the House that it hurt a great deal. The surgeon saved my life on that occasion. Subsequently, it is well known that I had a meningioma in April and was recently given the all clear by Mr Neil Kitchen and the amazing staff at Queen Square hospital in north London.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/3">My grandmother was an NHS matron and I have had bowel cancer screening. Certain family members have had this cancer, so I had the colonoscopy that was medically advised in those circumstances. I would certainly not be an MP were it not for the campaigns I waged on behalf of Savernake hospital in Wiltshire, where I was born; that hospital also saved my mum&#8217;s life.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/4">I would like to declare an interest as a taxpayer. The NHS&#8217;s approach to individual screening is surely an issue in which we should all be interested&#8212;from the point of view of prevention of loss of life and the maintenance of good health, but also in respect of how NHS funding, which is clearly finite, is spent on preventing future problems.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/5">I pay tribute to the Beating Bowel Cancer regime, to Cancer Research UK, to the British Society of Gastroenterology, and to Professor Wendy Atkin, her funders and the 170,000 volunteers who took part in her definitive study of flexible sigmoidoscopy, which is known as a flexi-scope. I also pay tribute to Imperial College London, University College London, the University of East Anglia and St Mark&#8217;s hospital, and to the variety of doctors, constituents, charities and members of the public who have worked so hard to combat this problem and have helped me to prepare for the debate&#8212;including the clinicians, particularly Dr Colin Rees.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/6">As a Member of Parliament representing a constituency in the north-east, I am proud to say that the north-east leads the way in bowel cancer screening. It was the first to complete coverage of an entire region in April 2010.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/7">Before I embark on the substance of my argument, I also make an apology on behalf of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40587" name="Nadhim Zahawi">the Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi)</phrase>, who sponsored the Beating Bowel Cancer reception in the House last year. Much to his regret, he cannot be here tonight. He is a good friend of mine, but he is well known in the House&#8212;and, indeed, throughout the world&#8212;for having worn the Beating Bowel Cancer tie, which I am now wearing, in the Chamber after that reception. My hon. Friend, who has quite a generous build, was attempting to restrain that generous build with his suit when he accidentally touched a button on the tie, setting</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/8">off a melody that lasted for nearly two minutes. Madam Deputy Speaker virtually extracted him from the Chamber. I understand that the incident was reported in 25 countries, and did more for the screening of bowel cancer worldwide than anything that anyone has said since.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/9">I have no future as a surgeon, and I assure the House that I have removed the bottom half of my own tie so that there is no possibility of my being extracted from the Chamber for being too musical.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/10">Let me now make some serious points about the clinical position. Traditional bowel cancer screening involves the faecal occult blood test, known as the FOB. In the last few years 11 million people in the country have been offered the test, 6 million have accepted it, 120,000 scopes have followed, and 12,000 diagnostic findings of cancer have resulted. It is clear from the statistics that lives have been saved. Previously those screened were aged between 60 and 69, but screening has now been extended to those aged between 60 and 74. It should be noted that the north-east&#8212;leading the way, as it does so often in a medical context&#8212;was the first region to extend the age group.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/11">Tragically, take-up of that vital free NHS screening is only 54%, whereas take-up of breast cancer screening is 74% and take-up of cervical cancer screening is 79%. However, the situation is changing. Professor Wendy Atkin and her team have brought flexible sigmoidoscopy to the forefront of bowel cancer screening. The results of their 16-year study were definitive. Their randomised trial, which followed 170,432 people, established that the flexi-scope examination reduces the incidence of bowel cancer in those aged between 55 and 64 by a third. Mortality was 43% lower among that group than it was in members of the control group.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.2/12">The flexi-scope test works by detecting and removing growths on the bowel wall, known as polyps, which can become cancerous if left untreated. It can prevent cancer from developing by removing polyps before they become cancerous, and provides long-lasting protection from bowel cancer.</p>

	<p pid="b.420.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this very important debate. Does he agree that screening for certain kinds of hereditary cancers, such as non-polypsosis colorectal cancer, should begin at a much earlier age, and should take place relatively frequently throughout the lives of those who are screened?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.420.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" speakername="Guy Opperman" colnum="420"  time="019:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0004.htm#11112385005350">
	<p pid="b.420.1/1">I do indeed. I welcome the fact that the guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence have changed to allow screening to become considerably more frequent in such cases. I am sure that the Minister will comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/2">Flexi-scope screening will undoubtedly save thousands of lives. FOB screening saved 700 to 1,000 lives a year, and flexi-scope screening will save about 3,000 lives a year. To confirm that, the Government implemented a pathfinder project in three areas. Unsurprisingly, two of those areas were in the north-east, this country&#8217;s leading medical region. The three areas were South of Tyne and Wear and Tees, along with Derby. The pathfinder findings are with the Department of Health and have not yet been published, but I can assure the House that, in broad terms, they accord with Professor Atkin&#8217;s findings. Last October, the Prime Minister announced a</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/3">proposal to pilot the scheme nationally in 2012, but there are clinical and funding issues that need to be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/4">First, when is the Department of Health going to invite bids for the follow-on pilot process, given that that was supposed to be done in 2011 and it is now <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-23">23 November</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/5">Secondly, clinicians raise the specific concern that the flexi-scope system is only manageable if we have a sufficiency of trained nurse endoscopists, so where are we in respect of this crucial training? Even with the most amazing piece of equipment, if we do not have the people to operate and interpret it, it is useless. Under this scheme, several hundreds of thousands of endoscopies will have to be carried out, with colonoscopies to follow in about 10% of cases. Therefore, everything will depend on training.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/6">Thirdly, how does the Department of Health plan to assess its age groups? My understanding is that the current group of 60 to 74-year-olds will have FOB testing, and those aged 55 will have a flexi-scope. That is relatively clear, but what will happen for gentlemen and ladies in the 56-to-60 age group is not at all clear. Will they be offered the flexi-scope as well, or is that to be based solely on GP referral? Trusts need guidance on what they are to do with such a large and unknown number of people, as they need to plan budgets, staffing and much more besides.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/7">Fourthly, we need to assess what we are going to do with those who have a flexi-scope at 55 and receive the all-clear and then reach the age of 60. Will we rescreen? Anyone who has ever worked in the health industry will know that there is &#8220;health speak&#8221;, and in this case the following question would be asked: &#8220;What is the parallel screening modality for the future?&#8221; As always, &#8220;health speak&#8221; is gibberish, but the simple question here is: are we going to rescreen people who are fine at 55?</p>

	<p pid="b.421.0/1">I have also gone through the screening process because of a family history of cancer. My GP and consultant at that time said the screening would have to be done again in a year&#8217;s time and then again a year later, in order to be absolutely sure. Has the hon. Gentleman considered whether there should be checks not just every now and again, but on a periodic basis?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.421.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" speakername="Guy Opperman" colnum="421"  time="019:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0004.htm#11112385005352">
	<p pid="b.421.1/1">It is ultimately up to the clinician&#8212;which it should be, frankly. The Minister must say how this policy will be implemented, but it should always be clinically driven.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/2">Fifthly, trusts need confirmation that the pilot projects to be implemented next year will be funded from national funding.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/3">I want to turn briefly to the financial case. The researchers behind the Atkin study suggest that the screening programme will reduce the costs associated with treating people with bowel cancer. Ministers will be aware of the Department of Health-commissioned report, as set out in the memorably named journal, <i>Gut</i>, in 2006, which suggested that if a screening programme based on this test was effective, it could save an average of &#163;28 for every person screened. I urge the Minister to follow what a lot of doctors and others have recommended. We must understand why people do not take up the</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/4">state&#8217;s offer to safeguard their health. If only 54% of those eligible are taking up this offer, that is a serious issue that needs to addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/5">When should we start screening? I speak as an MP whose constituency borders Scotland, and we are often told that in Scotland the health care system is much better, much more expansive and so much more free. In Scotland, FOB screening takes place at 60, not 50 as it does in this country and my understanding is that they do not intend to take up the flexi-scope screening. Personally, I am yet to be persuaded of the clinical or financial basis for screening at the age of 50 given the immense task of screening from the age of 55 onwards, with all the numbers of people who will go through the system. Although there might be pressure&#8212;obviously, the Opposition Benches are packed&#8212;to move towards such screening at 50, there is no clinical or financial basis in the current system to justify such an approach.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/6">I want to address the possible role of private or other public organisations, suitably supervised, in this process of change. We need to explore the issue of those whom the state must look after but do not take up the offer of screening. It affects both their health and our finite budget. The state must and will always be the provider of medical services in the future&#8212;no one disputes that&#8212;but it must also enable change and encourage private or public organisations to help in health care. All acknowledge that the take-up of screening is tragically low, as 46% resist the chance to screen themselves for bowel cancer and more than 20% of women resist the chance to have cervical or breast cancer screening. Everybody must accept that there is a problem with that. How can we address that?</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/7">Only the short-sighted or extremely socialist would suggest that the state always has the answer to all those problems. What if public sector organisations were to go the extra mile and care for their employees in a different way? We should bear it in mind that the state spends a fortune training its employees to carry out their designated tasks, whether they are consultants, surgeons, endoscopists or nurses. It surely makes sense to safeguard one&#8217;s assets&#8212;that is, one&#8217;s employees. Why not use the public sector as a lead by making it either mandatory or strongly advisable that all permanent core workers should have the screening that their health deserves and that we ask of the rest of the public? I would suggest that they should lead the way. That follows on from the point that is made about flu jabs and the prevention of winter problems in hospital.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/8">We should also consider companies; I want to finish on a localism point. We always criticise employers in this House, but let us say that we had an enlightened employer. Why could they not be allowed or even encouraged to conduct screening of their workers, in whom they invest so much? There is clearly a benefit to the worker, the employer-employee relationship would improve as the employee was valued and cared for, and the state would not necessarily have to pay for the health care screening provided to its citizens. I am talking not just about bowel cancer screening, which is quite complex. Breast cancer screening, for example, is important but not necessarily that difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/9">The cost of such privately paid screening could then be borne in the form of a reclaimable tax break to the company, such as an equivalent cut in the cost of the company&#8217;s local business taxes. That would offer localism,</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/10">increased health screening and better care for employees. Although there might be some data protection issues and concerns about who would pay for the follow-up care, it would unquestionably improve the take-up of screening. I refuse to accept that there is no mileage in my suggestion, which surely brings true localism and better screening to the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/11">In the minute or so I have left, I want to address the fact that this is men&#8217;s health awareness month and individual members of the public must take responsibility for their own health. All around us, perfectly sane men are sporting moustaches as &#8220;Movember&#8221; kicks into gear. For too long, men have ignored their health. It is well known that they do not have regular check ups. The reality is&#8212;I am not surprised the House is not packed this evening&#8212;men do not like to talk about the prostate or their bowel. As one of the nurses I met in hospitals put it to me: &#8220;Men and their bits&#8212;they get so precious about them! If men had to go through what women have to go through with cervical cancer screening and pregnancy they would be a great deal more healthy and self aware.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/12">I praise the television celebrity Chris Evans for his campaign to show that there is no shame and in fact great benefit in having bowel cancer screening. The shame in such matters exists when people ignore the signs and even die through false manliness or ignorance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-11-23b.423.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40594" speakername="Paul Burstow" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="423"  time="019:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111123/debtext/111123-0004.htm#11112385005353">
	<p pid="b.423.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40315" name="Guy Opperman">the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)</phrase> on securing the debate and on setting out the issues so clearly. Let me just confirm the answer that he gave to his hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40654" name="Harriett Baldwin">the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)</phrase>&#8212;it is the case that the NICE guidance has been changed in the way that he said. I hope that helps her. I look forward to reading the <i>Hansard</i> report of his description of his tie and the removal of certain items that would have made a noise in the debate had he pressed the button.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/2">My hon. Friend the Member for Hexham has used this opportunity very well to raise awareness of these issues further. There has been good progress in bowel cancer survival over the past 30 years, with the survival rates for men and women doubling, but it remains a devastating disease. In 2009, some 32,751 people were diagnosed with the cancer and 12,691 people died from it. In the vast majority of cases, the earlier a cancer is diagnosed, the sooner the treatment can begin and the better the outcomes are likely to be. That is why early diagnosis of cancer is central to the Government&#8217;s cancer outcome strategy and that is why it is vital that we do more to diagnose cancers earlier and improve survival rates as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/3">We are focusing on survival rates because they are a much more effective way of addressing and assessing NHS performance, as they show how good the NHS is, compared with other countries, at diagnosing and treating people with cancer. Measures such as cancer mortality figures are not a good way of assessing the NHS&#8217;s performance as they are an indicator of both incidence and survival. They indicate more about societal changes than about what the NHS has done.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/4">Screening is one of the most important means by which cancer&#8212;and in the case of bowel cancer, of abnormalities that may lead to cancer&#8212;can be detected earlier. Research undertaken in Nottingham and Denmark in the 1980s showed that screening men and women aged 45 to 74 for bowel cancer using the faecal occult blood test could reduce the mortality rate from bowel cancer by 16%. An independently evaluated pilot in Warwickshire and Scotland showed that this research could be replicated in an NHS setting. Based on the final evaluation report of the pilot and a formal options appraisal, the programme in England began screening men and women aged 60 to 69 in July 2006, and I am pleased to say that full roll-out was achieved last August.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/5">Experts have estimated that by 2025, about 2,400 lives could be saved every year by the current NHS bowel cancer screening programme. However, I agree with my hon. Friend that there may be more we could do through occupational health interventions. As at <phrase class="date" code="2011-10-31">31 October</phrase> this year, more than 12.2 million kits had been sent out and more than 6.9 million had been returned. We have to do more to get more returns, but from those returns 10,785 cancers were detected and 53,616 patients underwent polyp removal. As my hon. Friend said, polyps that are left untreated can develop into bowel cancer. Men and women over the age limit can request a testing kit every two years, and more than 145,000 have self-referred to the screening programme in just that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/6">As some 15% of bowel cancers&#8212;4,893 in 2009&#8212;are diagnosed in men and women aged 70 to 74, the NHS bowel cancer screening programme is currently being extended to men and women aged from 70 up to their 75th birthday. As at the end of October this year, 33 of the 58 local screening centres had implemented the extension of that programme. When the extension is fully rolled out by next year, about 1 million more men and women will be screened each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/7">We know that the evidence for faecal occult blood test screening starts at 50, as shown by the trials that have been mentioned. The original programme invited only people in their 60s because the risk of bowel cancer increases with age. Nearly 85% of bowel cancers arise in people over the age of 60. In the pilot, more than three times more cancers were detected in people aged over 60 than in those under 60, and people in their 60s were most likely to complete the testing kit. In addition, there was not enough endoscopy resource to begin the wider age roll-out. To underline a point that my hon. Friend made, in terms of cost, the 2004 working group report on NHS cancer screening programmes, which assessed a number of models for bowel cancer screening, found that starting at age 50 ranked fifth&#8212;bottom&#8212;in terms of cost-effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/8">The national endoscopy training programme has allowed us to begin extending the programme to people up to age 75. However, this extension to the current programme, the planned introduction of flexible sigmoidoscopy screening, which I will come back to in a moment, and the move to more investigations of symptomatic patients mean that a key priority is to increase endoscopy activity. We have begun from a low level, as my hon. Friend suggested, with much lower rates of endoscopy than many other comparable countries. For example, colonoscopy rates in England are 8 per</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/9">1,000 population, compared with Scotland, where they are 12 per 1,000 population, and Australia, where the rate is 21 per 1,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/10">The Department has undertaken further modelling work to estimate the demand for endoscopy services up to 2015-16. That analysis shows that the NHS will need to increase lower GI endoscopic capacity by 15% a year over the next five years to meet underlying growth and the commitments set out in the Government&#8217;s cancer outcomes strategy. In response to my hon. Friend&#8217;s question, that is how the issue about the work force and making sure that there is a sufficient supply of nurse endoscopists is being addressed.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/11">Funding for an increased number of endoscopies has been put into primary care trust baselines, and that is part of the &#163;750 million over four years that accompanies the cancer outcomes strategy. While it is primarily for the NHS to take the necessary steps to increase endoscopy activity, we are looking at the scope for central support, for example, through service improvement work led by NHS Improvement. However, we are making a huge investment in our bowel screening programme for people in their 50s, in response to my hon. Friend&#8217;s fifth question about funding. In September 2010, we announced &#163;60 million of funding for the introduction of a life-saving new screening method&#8212;flexible sigmoidoscopy&#8212;in the programme.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/12">Flexible sigmoidoscopy is an alternative, and a complementary bowel screening methodology to faecal occult blood. New evidence shows that men and women aged 55 attending a one-off flexible sig screening test for bowel cancer can reduce the risk of mortality from the disease by 43%, and it can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer by 33%. Flexi sig involves a thin, bendy tube, which the doctor uses to look at the inside wall of the bowel and remove any growths&#8212;polyps&#8212;that are present. Bowel cancer usually develops very slowly from polyps, which are called adenomas. By removing them at an early stage, it is possible to prevent bowel cancer from developing.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/13">My hon. Friend referred to the randomised controlled trials conducted by Cancer Research UK, the Medical Research Council and NHS R&amp;D in 14 UK and six Italian centres. The study concluded that flexi sig is a safe and practical test and, when offered only once between the ages 55 and 64, it confers a substantial and long-lasting benefit. Based on the trial figures, experts estimate that we could prevent as many as 3,000 cancers every year and save thousands of lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/14">In 2011, pathfinder sites tested organisational arrangements for the operation of flexi sig screening, with particular attention to the invitation and appointment process. That will enable optimal strategies to be applied in the national pilots. The pathfinder sites were in the Tees, south of Tyne and Wear, and Derbyshire local screening centres. We have formal agreements in place to develop the IT system for flexi sig&#8212;I hope that that answers my hon. Friend&#8217;s first question&#8212;and local screening centres will be invited to bid to become pilot sites early in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/15">In response to my hon. Friend&#8217;s third and fourth questions, the bowel cancer screening advisory committee has advised that people should be invited at age 55, with two reminders, before they become eligible for the faecal occult blood test programme at 60. People from the original trial are being followed up to gain information about the most appropriate faecal occult blood test policy for people who have undergone flexi sig screening. We do not have the answer yet, but we are working to make sure that we do have a clear answer to assist physicians.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/16">The coalition Government&#8217;s cancer strategy set out our aim to achieve 30% coverage of flexi sig screening across England by 2013-14, and 60% by 2014-15. It is envisaged that full roll-out will be achieved by 2016. We are also looking at other ways in which we can improve bowel cancer screening. Our cancer outcomes strategy sets out how NHS cancer screening programmes will look at how more accurate and easier-to-use immunochemical faecal occult blood tests&#8212;those are words that one can struggle with, and I hope <i>Hansard</i> will be kind to me&#8212;can be introduced into the programme, potentially to increase uptake and to provide more accurate results. A protocol has been devised to pilot such testing within the programme to assess the feasibility, practicality and cost-effectiveness of moving to this new technology.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/17">To date our awareness activity has focused on bowel cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer, and we have spent nearly &#163;11 million supporting 59 cancer awareness campaigns and trialling a national bowel cancer campaign. That campaign is about making sure that people do not die of embarrassment when it comes to bowel cancer, and that, if they think there is blood in their poo or if they have loose stools, they will go and see their GP and get a referral for a diagnosis. It is also about Ministers, as much as anyone else, overcoming their embarrassment about talking about it. The more we are prepared to start talking about these embarrassing subjects, the less people will die of embarrassment as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/18">We know that the pilot, the Be Clear on Cancer campaign, which we launched in January this year and ran for seven weeks in the east of England and in the south-west, made a real difference in the number of people being referred into the programme. The evaluation of the Be Clear on Cancer campaign to date has shown that people have become much more aware of the signs and symptoms of bowel cancer, people have been very supportive of such campaigns by the Government, and there has been an increase of about 50% in people over 50 with the relevant symptoms going to see their GP. This increase will lead to people being saved.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/19">I hope this debate has reassured people that the Government take bowel cancer screening as a serious priority. We are determined to save more lives in future and I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/20" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/21" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
