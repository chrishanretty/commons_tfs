	<p pid="a.379.7/1">I will look at the specific issue of the ceramics industry. I know that the hon. Gentleman was involved in promoting an anti-dumping action. We considered the matter carefully, and there were not sufficient grounds to support the rather disproportionate action advocated by the European Commission. Indeed, the Chinese market share has remained pretty unchanged over the past decade. However, we will certainly consider what else can be done to help the industry.</p>

	<p pid="a.379.9/1">I was in the west country just over a week ago looking at the aerospace industry, which is a considerable success story. My hon. Friend is quite right that one of the constraints is the need for skilled manpower, which is why in our rapidly growing apprenticeship programme we are setting aside funding specifically for advanced apprenticeships in engineering skills of the kind that firms in his constituency need.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.0/1">A stimulus to demand is coming from two sources. One is rapidly growing export markets in emerging markets, where our export growth is very substantial. Manufacturers, including small and medium-sized enterprises, are taking a substantial part of that. In addition our monetary policy, which is supported by the Bank of England, with low short and long interest rates, quantitative easing and credit easing, is supporting demand.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.1/1">In his efforts to support manufacturing, will the Secretary of State agree that high executive pay that rewards not success but failure can inhibit growth, and that dealing with it is an important part of supporting manufacturing, financial services and other parts of the economy?</p>

	<p pid="a.380.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and the point is very well made. There is now a remarkable consensus. We have had evidence to the inquiry that I initiated into executive pay from, among others, the CBI, showing a high level of social responsibility and an acknowledgment that much executive pay has been disproportionate and unrelated to performance in the past. We intend to reform that.</p>

	<p pid="a.380.3/1">Mr Speaker,</p>
	<p pid="a.380.3/2">&#8220;Germany has had an industrial strategy as well as an economic strategy. Applied with huge consistency of purpose. This has greatly helped German industry plan for the future. Let us compare this with the position in the UK&#8230;In terms of industrial policy there are serious deficiencies.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.380.3/3">Those are not my words, but those of Lord Heseltine in a speech only a couple of weeks ago. Given yesterday&#8217;s dire figures from the Office for National Statistics, which showed the biggest output drop in manufacturing since April, and three times the fall forecast by analysts, is it not time the Secretary of State listened to Lord Heseltine and provided a comprehensive well-planned industrial strategy for the long term that supports British manufacturing and helps it become more competitive?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.380.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40618" speakername="Vincent Cable" colnum="380"  time="10:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0001.htm#11120860001278">
	<p pid="a.380.4/1">I often wonder which Opposition Front Bencher will be courageous enough to talk about manufacturing, reminding the House that we lost 1.7 million jobs in manufacturing in 13 years of a Labour Government, and manufacturing&#8217;s share of the economy shrank from 18% to 10%. We are addressing that, and I certainly listen to Lord Heseltine, who has an office in my Department. We frequently interact, and he has some very good suggestions.</p>
	<p pid="a.380.4/2">We are pursuing support for innovation through the advanced technology innovation centre, pursuing support for advanced apprenticeships, on which we are doing a great deal, and co-financing private investment through the regional growth fund and the Green investment bank, which is due to start. As I announced yesterday, we are also considerably increasing support for supply chains using a new &#163;125 million fund.</p>

	<p pid="a.381.5/1">For many years, small and medium-sized enterprises in particular have felt that they are caught in the stranglehold of gold-plated red tape when it comes to growing and employing more people.

	<p pid="a.381.7/1">I recently met local business people at a constituency event sponsored by the Federation of Small Businesses, and they told me that they were apprehensive about taking on additional employees because of the culture of employment tribunals, to which employees can take even the most spurious claims without any personal risk whatever.

	<p pid="a.382.5/3">Citizens Advice described it as a rogue&#8217;s charter; only 6% of SMEs consider employment law as a factor when employing people; and the Secretary of State himself has said that there was already a &#8220;reasonably good balance&#8221; between rights and flexibility in Britain. So why is his Department&#8212;the Department for no growth&#8212;trying to make it easier to fire rather than hire people?</p>

	<p pid="a.384.4/1">I welcome that assurance from the Minister, but an exporter in my constituency has for years been obtaining certificates of origin from our local chamber of commerce, using a formal declaration from his supplier. Recently he applied for a new certificate, but was told that one could not be issued without a declaration from the manufacturer of the goods. That is causing my constituent a big problem, because his supplier is loth to provide details about his manufacturer for fear that my constituent might obtain his goods direct. What can my hon.

	<p pid="a.385.0/1">At a previous Question Time, the Business Secretary was right to say that, historically, SMEs have not been as involved in exporting as larger companies. With that in mind, earlier this year he launched the export enterprise finance guarantee scheme, a programme run out of his Department, and we were told that that would help lots of SMEs to access export finance. Will the Secretary of State tell us how many companies have been helped by the scheme since it was announced with a great fanfare 10 months ago?</p>

We have been able to deliver some &#163;242 million across the five products, and we have also been able to ensure that with the pilot, the export enterprise finance guarantee scheme, in which there have been a number of changes, we have been able to deliver some &#163;2 million. It is important to bear in mind the fact that the export enterprise finance guarantee scheme is a pilot; the other four are actually full products.</p>

	<p pid="a.385.2/1">The answer to my question is that just four companies have benefited from that export scheme. That is another example of the failure of the Minister&#8217;s Department to improve access to finance for small businesses. Of course access to finance in general helps SMEs to grow and expand into different export markets, and we were told that Project Merlin would ease credit conditions for small businesses&#8212;but net lending to businesses by banks has contracted in nine of the past 12 months under this Government. Merlin failed, so they are now giving credit easing a try, but the effectiveness of credit easing is dependent on whether the banks choose to participate. What guarantees can the Minister give us that they will participate in the scheme and increase net lending to businesses as a result?</p>

	<p pid="a.385.3/1">In the first three quarters, the numbers on net lending stand at &#163;66 million. <i>[Interruption.] </i>What I am trying to say to the hon. Gentleman is that we are committed, through Merlin, to ensure that lending this year is greater than last year. He needs to be careful in this area, because, as he knows, such schemes are subject to demand. <i>[Interruption.] </i>He asked about credit easing, and I will come to that point. I say to the hon. Gentleman that the &#163;20 billion that the Chancellor has put forward is substantially important and will bring about an important increase. What the Opposition need to remember is that we are actually delivering an increase in lending this year over last year. They did not deliver that. We are, and that is the difference.</p>

At the Competitiveness Council in Brussels on Tuesday, I argued that European research funding should be more easily accessible for small and medium-sized enterprises. The best way to achieve that is by cutting bureaucracy and the complexity in the current arrangements for accessing European funding. That is what I urged on the Commission.</p>

	<p pid="a.390.2/2">Earth observation satellites are critical in helping developing countries manage humanitarian and environmental crises. Does my right hon. Friend see merit in giving such countries British technology or satellite time&#8212;provided it is the best for the job, and it usually is&#8212;rather than having ring-fenced funding to purchase such services from a third country?</p>

	<p pid="a.390.3/1">That is a very interesting idea. It is absolutely right that British satellite technology plays a greater role than is recognised in ensuring that we have information about the sites of disasters. Earlier this year we chaired the disaster monitoring committee, which ensured that satellite images were immediately available after the tsunami in Japan and after disasters elsewhere in the world. There are certainly imaginative ideas through which this role could be enhanced.</p>

	<p pid="a.397.7/2">a great opportunity and I hope it will be one of those areas where the Labour party will set aside the posturing and work with us positively.</p>

In other words, the large companies were to be managed by the small company. Is it not time that we actually did what the Electrical Contractors Association has called for and make it compulsory for 30 days&#8217; payment to be in every single contract for a small supplier?</p>

	<p pid="a.401.2/1">Making sure that we have enough water for everyone will be one of the major challenges this country will have to deal with in the years ahead. Today&#8217;s publication of &#8220;Water for Life&#8221; recognises that water is essential for economic growth and that we must protect the environment for future generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/2">The White Paper is a blueprint for action. It outlines plans to modernise the rules that govern how we take water from our rivers; it explains how we will improve the condition of our rivers by encouraging local organisations to improve water quality and ensure we are extracting water from our environment in the least harmful way; it announces plans to reform the water industry and deregulate water markets to drive economic growth; it enables business and public sector customers to negotiate better services from suppliers and to cut their costs; it removes barriers that have discouraged new entrants from competing in the water market; it asks water companies to consider where water trading and interconnecting pipelines could help to ensure secure water supplies at a price customers can afford; it enables water companies to introduce new social tariffs for people struggling to pay their bills and seeks to tackle bad debt that ordinary householders have to bear the cost of to the tune of &#163;15 a year; and it tackles the historic unfairness of water infrastructure in the south-west.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/3">The White Paper is the Government taking leadership on an issue of critical importance to our economy and our environment. It is a bold vision for the management and harnessing of an increasingly scarce but vital resource and I welcome this opportunity to discuss it with hon. Members today.</p>

	<p pid="a.401.3/1">I start by thanking the Secretary of State for her note explaining why the market-sensitive parts of the White Paper were briefed to the stock exchange this morning and expressing my disappointment that she is not giving us her views on this.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.3/2">We have just had the driest 12 months since records began 100 years ago. That has affected water quality, restricted boating activity and seen wildfires destroy valuable habitats. Last month, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs granted Anglian Water a drought permit, a highly unusual move for the autumn, when reservoirs are normally filling up. Last Thursday, the Environment Agency&#8217;s drought prospect report revealed that south-east England is at high risk of drought next year with some restrictions possible on customer supply. Ensuring a safe, affordable and continuous supply of water while protecting the environment and managing unpredictable rainfall is a major challenge. The White Paper is of intense interest to the public, who are worried about rising bills as real incomes fall and household budgets are squeezed. It builds on Labour&#8217;s Cave and Walker reviews, which we commissioned, and takes an evolutionary approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.3/3">We welcome the proposals to introduce greater competition for business and public sector customers and to establish a cross-border market between England and Scotland for water and sewerage services. We also welcome the fact that water efficiency measures will be part of the green deal, as proposed by my hon. Friends the Members for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies) and for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger) during the passage of the Energy Act 2011. However, the White Paper is silent on how the water sector will reduce its carbon footprint and encourage energy from waste, and the proposals on the removal of historical abstraction licences, which cause such damage to our environment, are given an end date of 2025, which is far too late.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.3/4">Last week&#8217;s autumn statement announced &#163;40 million a year to help 700,000 households in the south-west pay their water bills. Will the Minister tell the House when the &#163;2 billion capital investment in the south-west that South West Water invested be paid off and how long the &#163;40 million subsidy will continue for those customers? How will he ensure that those proposals for South West Water meet EU state aid rules? We know that bills in the south-west are, on average, &#163;157 higher than those across the rest of the country, reflecting the botched Tory privatisation of 1989, which left 3% of the population paying for 30% of the country&#8217;s coastline and the &#163;2 billion investment in new sewerage services. Does that money set a precedent for other areas of the country to receive help to offset capital investment costs? The cost of the Thames tideway tunnel is now estimated to be over &#163;4 billion, so can Thames Water customers look forward to receiving similar help with their bills?</p>
	<p pid="a.401.3/5">More than 2,250,000 pensioners, single adults and families spend more than 5% of their disposable income on water bills. The Government&#8217;s proposals to help people with rising bills elsewhere in England and Wales are weak and unclear. How does the Minister propose to force water companies to ensure that those eligible people receive help with their bills when that will come straight off the company&#8217;s bottom line? What sanctions will there be for water companies that consistently fail to help people with their bills? Has he decided whether to fund Water Sure through public expenditure, as mentioned in the consultation in June, and, if so, what will the cost be per annum? Has he rejected the idea of match funding for company social tariffs in the south-west and modifying sewerage charges for non-household sectors?</p>
	<p pid="a.401.3/6">Today&#8217;s water White Paper is more than six months late, and it is a curate&#8217;s egg&#8212;good in part. We will work with the Government to ensure a fair deal for water customers, whatever part of the country they live in.</p>

	<p pid="a.402.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for the welcome she has given to large elements of the White Paper. She is right that it builds on work that has been done over many years. I am grateful to Professor Cave, Anna Walker and to David Gray for his report on Ofwat, which informed the White Paper, as have the contributions of many stakeholders, other organisations and Members of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/2">The hon. Lady made a slightly predictable and lame remark about why I am dealing with the issue today, rather than the Secretary of State. We have a style of management in this Government that encourages people to take control of the issues. It is a highly motivational</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/3">style that I recommend to her, because it encourages greater understanding of the issues. The Secretary of State and I have spent many hours preparing the White Paper and have immersed ourselves in the detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/4">The hon. Lady is wrong to suggest that there is not enough in the White Paper on reform of the abstraction system. The abstraction rules go back to the early 1960s and do not take into account changes to our climate and weather patters, and it is important that we have new and clear rules that take us into the future. We will consult in 2013 on our long-term approach to a transitional system of changing abstraction that will work and be sustainable in every sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/5">There are urgent measures that we need to take forward, because in constituencies similar to mine, much-loved and much-valued rivers, which are vital to our eco-systems and to the general health of our environment and to the way in which we value it, are running dry. The White Paper sets out clearly how the Environment Agency will work to bring forward speedily measures that change how we abstract water, so that we return water as quickly as possible to river systems, and our catchment approach, which we announced in March, will soon start to benefit water quality and pollution. I urge the hon. Lady to support that measure, which involves many local people, is effective and tackles the urgent situation that we face, brought about by the current low rainfall and the impending drought, unless we have a proper, wet winter.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/6">The hon. Lady mentioned South West Water. We believe that the announcement in the Budget, on which the Chancellor gave more detail in the autumn statement, sets out a way of righting a long-term wrong. It is to the credit of this Government that they have tackled it, because Members from all parts of the House have raised the issue for a great many years, and we are dealing with it. I am not going to pretend to her or to the House that the announcement will create the equivalence that people in the south-west might feel they deserve, but it is a considerable contribution and is separate from what we are doing to assist those on low incomes throughout the country to pay their bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/7">We are consulting on the guidelines that we will produce for companies&#8217; social tariffs, and I recommend to the hon. Lady the details in the White Paper on the excellent work that several water companies are doing to make it easier for people to pay their bills, and on the work that the companies are doing with organisations such as Citizens Advice and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/8">The hon. Lady asks how long the payment announced by the Chancellor will continue. In an almost unique announcement, I can tell the House that it will continue beyond the end of the spending review and, in fact, until at least the end of the next spending review. Of course, it will be for Ministers then to decide what happens after that.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/9">The hon. Lady talks about other high-cost items and their impact on people&#8217;s bills, and refers to the Thames tideway tunnel, which, as she rightly recognises, imposes a high cost on Thames Water customers. The cost of the project is of great concern to Ministers and to the Government, and we are looking at it very closely. We remain supportive of the scheme, however, and page 55 of the White Paper shows the Government&#8217;s clear support for it. The Thames is one of the most important rivers</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/10">running through an iconic city, and we need to ensure that it is clean. We believe that this scheme offers the best solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.0/11">The hon. Lady asks me about the guidance on tariffs. Water is a monopoly industry, and the monopoly industries are highly regulated by three regulators, so Ofwat will continue to set prices and to be an independent regulator. We will give clear guidance on where we think it should be going, but the relationship will remain the same and its responsibility will be to keep bills affordable.</p>

	<p pid="a.404.3/1">I have looked very carefully at that issue, and as my hon. Friend will know we are in the process of a very exciting change in how we manage our waterways, in transferring British Waterways to the charitable sector. There remains the opportunity to use our canals to move water around, but the sad truth is that water is an extremely heavy substance, and it is very carbon-intensive to move it very far. The economic assessments that I have seen state that to move water much more than 30 miles is un-economic, but through a range of different measures we start to see that, with interconnectors, we can incentivise water companies to use a variety of means to move water from neighbouring areas to theirs. Then, we can start moving a trickle of water from areas of high rainfall to areas of low rainfall.</p>

A key element of the White Paper is to send a very clear message to the investor community that we value the nearly &#163;100 billion of investment in our infrastructure over the past 22 years and want to see more of it in future. There have been two intentions in that direction: first, not to spook investors by giving the wrong indications about how we want to proceed on competition; and secondly, to say to the investor community, &#8220;This is a place of safety and security where you can invest for the long term.&#8221; We will still require greater infrastructure and elements of construction that will make our economy and our environment more resilient to the kinds of weather changes that are happening.</p>

	<p pid="a.405.4/1">One reason for over-abstraction from rivers such as the source of the Thames and the Malmesbury, the Avon and the Kennet in my constituency is that the law prevents planners from considering water and sewerage availability when agreeing unwanted out-of-town developments and large-scale developments such as those around Swindon.

During the drought last year, we engaged with abstractors, many of them from the farming community. We found that the Government have many tools at hand to deal with the problems now. There was some very innovative work by the Environment Agency, the National Farmers Union and other organisations on that. The White Paper addresses the urgent and available methods, but also considers a new, changeable abstraction scheme for the long term that encourages farmers to continue to produce food.</p>

If the Government had not taken responsibility for this issue by taking forward a clear vision of an abstraction regime that is fit for the future&#8212;it has been a problem for a long time that there has not been such a coalescing of ideas&#8212;farmers in her constituency would have been in a much worse condition.</p>

	<p pid="a.410.2/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/2">I have laid in the Library today a copy of a document that the Government are publishing entitled &#8220;Unlocking growth in cities&#8221;, and I have laid a written ministerial statement. The document outlines a new framework for the relationship between our larger cities and central Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/3">England&#8217;s largest cities&#8212;many of the issues in question are devolved matters&#8212;are the economic powerhouses of our country. We are offering them a menu of new powers that we want to explore as part of a series of bespoke &#8220;city deals&#8221;. The ability to do that comes from an amendment that was introduced into the Localism Bill, which was promoted by the core cities group and attracted all-party support. It allowed powers to be devolved to cities in future, and I believe it is important to act on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/4">Our cities have great potential to contribute more to growth, and to enable them to do that we want to free them from Whitehall control in a number of areas, with the aim of stimulating growth. The first wave of deals that we propose will be with the eight largest cities and their surrounding local enterprise partnerships. As with any deal, cities will have to offer something in return for their new powers and funding. They must guarantee that they can provide strong and accountable leadership, improve efficiency and outcomes, and be innovative in their approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/5">The bespoke approach of recognising the differences between cities and allowing licensed exceptions is a new idea to put cities back in charge of their own economic destiny and enable them to seize the opportunities for growth. It represents a big shift in how Whitehall works, with the presumption being that powers should be handed down wherever cities make a convincing case.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/6">It is important to say that today&#8217;s document sets out a series of indicative options for the transfers of control that could be considered as part of each deal-making process. The list is not intended to be a statement of policy or represent an automatic entitlement for cities. It is neither prescriptive nor exhaustive, but it might help the House if I give some examples of the content of the document.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/7">We want to bring an end to the current system of requiring cities to bid to different Whitehall departments for different pots of cash, whether for roads or housing. Instead, we want to explore whether they can get one consolidated capital pot, to direct as they see fit. We want them to have the ability to set lower business rates for certain types of company. We already have very successful business improvement districts, and sometimes firms in a particular sector across a wider area may benefit from the same degree of flexibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/8">There will be a &#163;1 billion boost to the regional growth fund to create jobs, and we will encourage cities to bid for that money to help clusters of businesses in their</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/9">area, so one bid could help several small companies. We know that many small businesses find the system of taking on apprentices daunting, so cities will be able to set up city apprenticeship hubs, which will help local employers and local people to make the most of the opportunities offered by apprenticeships.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/10">We want to improve the way in which services work together in cities, to make it easier for people to get back into work instead of being passed from one service to another&#8212;from Jobcentre Plus to the town hall to a careers advisor. That can be done under one roof, and we want to make that possible. We also want to offer powers over infrastructure to unlock investments in improving transport, housing and broadband. Currently, transport projects can be delayed because cities have to go through the Whitehall machinery, but they may have the capacity to make some of the decisions themselves. Cities should also be able to have more of a say on their priorities for housing and regeneration, instead of having to go through the Homes and Communities Agency.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/11">Cities will be able to bid for a share in a &#163;100 million capital investment pot to spend on ambitious broadband infrastructure projects. We expect bids to include a range of projects, including superfast broadband for strategic business areas and city-wide high-speed mobile connectivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/12">As I said, we want to start with the eight core cities that proposed the amendment to the Localism Bill, but I wish to be clear that our vision extends to the whole of urban Britain. I will be open to suggestions from other cities about how they can make use of the powers that the Bill, now the Localism Act 2011, gives them.</p>
	<p pid="a.410.2/13">The powers that we are proposing will help to allow our cities to be the economic, social and cultural magnets that they have the potential to be, and places where people aspire to live. Our cities have too often been straining at Whitehall&#8217;s leash, and they now have an opportunity to seize the powers that are available to them. I hope that the conversation and negotiations that we will have in the months ahead will be fruitful, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.411.0/1">Yes, I notice that the Minister refers to his &#8220;statement&#8221; to the House, and his observations did somewhat exceed the time limit allocated to Ministers for dealing with urgent questions&#8212;so much so that one wonders whether he might have considered making an oral statement in the first instance.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.411.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40353" speakername="Hilary Benn" colnum="411"  time="012:01:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0001.htm#11120860001470">
	<p pid="a.411.1/1">I am grateful to the Minister for his reply, but it should not have taken an urgent question to bring him to the Dispatch Box this morning. Once again, a major policy announcement affecting local government, this time made in the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s speech in my constituency this morning, is all over the national and regional media, who were clearly pre-briefed yesterday, whereas the House should have been told first today.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/2">The efforts of councils and communities up and down the country make the biggest contribution to our cities, and it is the Government&#8217;s job to help them do so. At least the Deputy Prime Minister acknowledged today that areas once synonymous with urban decay were &#8220;dramatically revived&#8221; thanks to Labour&#8217;s investment. However, when we examine the &#8220;unprecedented transfer of power&#8221; that he has talked of, in fact we find</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/3">unprecedented cuts, as confirmed in this morning&#8217;s local government settlement, on top of the cuts already resulting from the scrapping of regional development agencies. Those cuts are substantial, front-loaded and unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/4">Will the Minister explain why the 10% most deprived local authorities, which include the core cities of Manchester and Liverpool, are facing reductions in their spending power nearly four times greater than the 10% least deprived authorities? There is only one way to describe that, and it is as balancing the books on the backs of the poor or, when it comes to job losses, on the backs of women, who have lost twice as many jobs in local government as men since the coalition was formed. How many more public sector jobs will be lost in the core cities in view of the revised Office for Budget Responsibility forecast published last week?</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/5">When does the Minister expect the new powers for the core cities to be confirmed? He has assured the House today that they will be available regardless of the outcome of the mayoral referendums, so when does he propose to extend them to other councils?</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/6">On the devolution of local funding, we developed single pot funding, a good idea that is now being taken forward. We welcome that, but will the Minister tell the House by how much the Government have slashed local capital spending in the core cities? Is that not why we now face an &#8220;infrastructure deficit&#8221;? Those are not my words but those of the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/7">How will reducing the affordable housing budget by nearly &#163;4 billion unleash the power of local councils, including the core cities, when it means that they will find it much more difficult to provide the homes that their people need?</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/8">Councils will welcome a role on apprenticeships, although many already play a role, but why are local authorities, including the core cities, excluded from playing a part in the Work programme? Surely they should have a role in helping people to find jobs, which is an urgent task up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/9">On the changes to local government finance announced by the Deputy Prime Minister today, which will affect all councils, will the Minister give the House an assurance that no local authority will lose out financially? Will there be effective redistribution from the most well off to the least well off? How much of the increase in business rate revenue do the Government plan to keep for themselves? How exactly is that localisation?</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/10">On the business rate discounts, to which the Minister referred, who will decide where and to which industry they can be offered, and will he assure us that that will not just result in better-off areas being the ones that can attract new businesses?</p>
	<p pid="a.411.1/11">The Opposition support strong and innovative local government, which should have the powers it needs to do that job, but no amount of warm words will hide two very uncomfortable facts: the Government are cutting unfairly and their failed economic policy is undermining the growth of our core cities and all local communities, when what they really need is a change of course.</p>

	<p pid="a.412.0/1">I accept your words, Mr Speaker, that, such is the replete quantity of announcements that we are making, I might have made a statement on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/2">However, I am pleased to be able to respond to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40353" name="Hilary Benn">the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/3">The intention of the proposals is to begin a series of negotiations with cities&#8212;we have not made a definitive announcement of powers that will be vested in one city rather than another. I thought it reasonable to publish a document to encourage cities across the country and see what others have suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman mentioned RDAs, but he will know that local enterprise partnerships in each of the cities are making major contributions to our reform. It is significant that when people were invited to make a proposal on how they should organise themselves economically, local businesses and local authorities proposed core cities as a preferable alternative. I am not aware of any consensus on the retention of RDAs.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/5">On the local government finance settlement, to which the right hon. Gentleman referred, he will know that this is the second year of a settlement announced last year. I can confirm that the figures are exactly the same. The average reduction in spending power is 3.3%, which is less than last year&#8217;s reduction, and there is the protection of a maximum reduction of 8.8%.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/6">In terms of fairness, we have again advantaged the deprivation and needs component of the formula to ensure that it has a greater weight compared with the system that we inherited.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/7">On jobs, the right hon. Gentleman will know that to rebalance the economy it is important that we have private sector job creation. That is the agenda that the local enterprise partnerships are putting forward, and each of the core cities is clear that that is what is needed. They have a great capacity to create private sector jobs. Our future jobs are likely to come from knowledge-intensive industries, of which cities are ideally placed to be the hosts. In cities, people are in close proximity with one another and can share knowledge and insights. Cities will be the cradles of growth in future, and it is right that private sector job creation should be the key to that. He will also know that the Office for Budget Responsibility independent report on the autumn statement projected an increase in private sector jobs of 1.7 million in the years ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/8">We will negotiate case by case on what each city would like to be part of the single pot. It is important that we recognise that the needs of Liverpool are perhaps different from those of Bristol or of Leeds.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/9">The right hon. Gentleman asked who should approve the discounts available in business rates. That is clearly a matter for the local authorities representing the whole of the city area. When there are industry specific arrangements, we would expect a ballot of those industries, as with business improvement districts, which can have a higher levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.412.0/10">The proposals we are making today are consonant with the discussions that we have had with each of the core cities during months past. I hope that the right hon. Gentleman and his colleagues, having been instrumental in providing this power, will join the leaders of all parties in the cities to ensure that we can give them the tools they need to unlock growth in their areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.414.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One power that we are keen to see devolved to cities is a greater ability to invest in infrastructure, which can unlock growth and lead to financial prosperity.

	<p pid="a.414.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman will know that the Government have consulted on precisely that. It is important that there is a strong connection between an authority&#8217;s business rate receipts&#8212;all authorities; not just cities&#8212;and its policy behaviour in respect of businesses. The direction in which we are headed is very clear, but the precise technical details will be made clear in days to come.</p>

	<p pid="a.414.4/1">I welcome today&#8217;s announcement, particularly the repatriation of business rates. Real localism means people having their own money to spend how they decide locally.

	<p pid="a.414.5/1">There is recognition that whatever the intentions behind the regional agencies, whether RDAs or regional arrangements more generally, they had become instruments&#8212;or, as it were, embassies&#8212;of Whitehall in the country. Our preferred approach is to devolve powers to cities so that they can revive their reputation of being able to determine their own future and stand proudly in the world as beacons of investment.</p>

All parties should ensure that they are on the right side of the ambition of local government for greater independence. Is the Minister aware that local government in this country is one of the few in any of the western democracies to remain a creature of statute?</p>

	<p pid="a.415.0/1">I commend the work of the hon. Gentleman and his Committee. He is right that we want to improve the standing of local government and its ability to be recognised as having&#8212;in effect&#8212;a constitutional significance that cannot simply be brushed aside. As he will know, our reforms in the Localism Act 2011 move considerably in that direction to establish a general power of competence for local government, so that it no longer exists to do those things that it is told to do by Parliament and central Government. Instead, the default should be the other way around: councils should be able to do things unless they are explicitly prevented from doing them by Parliament. The Act is a huge step in that direction, but I look forward to the report from the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Committee&#8212;it will be taken very seriously in the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.415.4/1">I know that there has been an extensive debate, and great opposition in the area, about that issue, but it was settled. Rather than change administrative boundaries, which could bog down this process and waste time, our choice has been to respect existing administrative boundaries and, within that, transfer powers.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will make on the reform of business rates, combined with the access to single capital pots, will provide&#8212;for the first time&#8212;the ability as of right for cities to invest in their infrastructure, attract businesses and reap the rewards of doing so, and so enter that virtuous circle.</p>

	<p pid="a.416.0/1">The Minister has announced some very interesting measures, but I am not entirely sure that they will compensate for the huge cuts our cities face. It is very disappointing that Leicester is still not considered a core city. We are the pre-eminent city in the east midlands, we have a very successful mayor in Sir Peter Soulsby&#8212;a former Member of Parliament&#8212;and I am sure that the city could benefit from some of the proposals announced today.

	<p pid="a.416.3/1">My hon. Friend knows that our agenda for decentralisation extends across the country to authorities of all types&#8212;indeed, the Localism Act enacts those powers&#8212;but it is right to recognise that our cities have particular challenges and opportunities. Just as cities around the world have prospered from having a policy focus, it is right that we should consider the challenges of urban Britain and, by transferring powers to cities and encouraging them to realise their potential, we should help our cities to do what cities in other countries do, which is to match or exceed the national average of prosperity. Too often, our cities are below the national average in income, and we want them to improve their position.</p>

	<p pid="a.416.5/1">The reforms give more control and more direct ability for authorities to have the resources that they need to invest. One of the features of the system</p>
	<p pid="a.416.5/2">that we inherited from several Governments is that too often our great cities, which have an international standing and reputation, have had to look up to Whitehall to plead for assistance when they have the capacity and resilience to invest and reap the rewards themselves.

	<p pid="a.417.1/1">This is one of the proposals that I expect to come from Bristol. The Government recognise, in this document, that cities include their surrounding area, and indeed that is how local enterprise partnerships defined themselves. One of the criteria for the deals is to ensure that all the connections in the area in and around the city are reflected in what is proposed, so I expect that to be part of the discussion that we will have with the authorities in my hon.

	<p pid="a.417.2/1">What the Minister&#8217;s paper shows, in what it says about LEPs and skills, is that Ministers are having to reinvent the wheel on what RDAs did. Belatedly, they are giving powers to LEPs, wasting 12 months in the process. Does he accept that, as Members on both sides of the House have said, these powers and opportunities should also be available to second-level towns, coastal towns, rural areas and suburban areas on the edge of cities? Will he also look at the need to combine a skills strategy with localism in those areas&#8212;something that his colleagues in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and across the Government have so far failed to do?</p>

	<p pid="a.417.3/1">That is explicitly referred to in the document. We want to give the opportunity for cities to engage in skills strategies and help to equip the next generation of workers to enable businesses to prosper. I have been clear in what I have said: while we are starting with the core cities, this should by no means be seen as an exclusive process and I want to extend these principles beyond that.</p>
	<p pid="a.417.3/2">On the point about the ability to do this through LEPs, I think that the identity and strength of cities were submerged under the regional structure that we inherited. Having swept away the regional approach, we are giving life to the potential of these cities, as is being increasingly recognised.</p>

	<p pid="a.418.1/1">My hon. Friend knows that coastal cities have been a particular focal point for the Government. As a considerable presence in his area, he will want to encourage his authority to make use of some of the powers that are generally available. It is right to recognise the importance of cities and what they can do, but one of the contributions that they can make is to revive the prosperity of areas even outside the city boundaries, and I am sure that that will be the case in and around the Humber.</p>

	<p pid="a.419.3/1">We have all been captivated this week by the images of the arrival of two giant pandas at Edinburgh zoo. Is the Leader of the House alarmed to realise that there are now more giant pandas in Scotland than there are Conservative MPs? Before the Deputy Leader of the House gets too comfortable, let me say that, given his party&#8217;s poll ratings in Scotland, it looks like its MPs are going to be joining the endangered species list north of the border as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/2">In 20 years in this place, I have never known business statements to contain so little legislative substance, especially so early in a Parliament. There has been little even resembling Government legislation in this place for weeks now. Will the Leader of the House explain why the Commons is twiddling its thumbs while the Lords teeters under the weight of badly drafted, highly controversial and ill-thought-out legislation? Was this part of the plan? Before he blames the Opposition, the snow or the royal wedding, analysis shows that thousands of Government amendments and endless Liberal Democrat</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/3">speeches are causing the logjam in the Lords. Why is the Government&#8217;s legislative programme so out of balance and why can they not manage it better?</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/4">Talking about incompetence, on Tuesday the Government lost their first vote in the House of Commons amid chaotic scenes as panic-stricken Government Whips first dragged their MPs out of the Aye Lobby and then shoved them back in again. By the time the doors were locked, <i>Hansard</i> shows fewer than a quarter of Government MPs were actually in the Lobby with just three Cabinet Ministers for company. I have to say that neither the Leader of the House nor his Deputy were among them. Thankfully for the Leader of the House, neither was the Chief Whip.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/5">I understand that when this defeat was announced, the cheers from the Carlton Club were even louder than those from Opposition Benches. What an ominous sign for the Prime Minister on his way to Brussels. Whether the Leader of the House likes it or not, this place has expressed a clear view by a majority of 134 that we require more time to debate this Government&#8217;s failing economic policy. Will the right hon. Gentleman now honour the clearly expressed wishes of this House, by scheduling further Government time for debate on the economy in the very near future?</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/6">This week, the Deputy Prime Minister vowed to go into the next election with a plan to means-test free bus passes and TV licences for millions of pensioners. Is that what his newly appointed &#8220;brand advisers&#8221; meant when they told him to act more like Oxfam? Some 9 million pensioners now want us to have a debate on whether this is Government policy? Will the Leader of the House oblige?</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/7">On Tuesday, a former Conservative Member of this House was caught on camera boasting of his access and influence at the heart of Downing street. This follows the still unanswered questions on the Werritty affair. In Opposition, the Prime Minister said that lobbying was the</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/8">&#8220;next big scandal waiting to happen.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/9">The Minister responsible gave a firm promise to the House that there would be a consultation document on the regulation of the lobbying industry by the end of November. Given that it is now December and next week is the last full parliamentary week before the recess, will the Leader of the House confirm that the promised consultation paper will be published next week?</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/10">Tory divisions on Europe have exploded into the open. The Prime Minister got a Euro-mauling from his own Back Benchers yesterday and the Eurosceptics are out on manoeuvres. Meanwhile, Cabinet Members are openly at war: the Work and Pensions Secretary is reportedly issuing threats over the phone; the Northern Ireland Secretary has taken to the airwaves demanding a referendum and the leader in waiting at City Hall is madly stirring the pot.</p>
	<p pid="a.419.3/11">We have a Tory grass-roots rebellion, a Cabinet divided and a Prime Minister isolated. Will the Leader of the House inform us what is different from the last Tory Government that he served in?</p>

	<p pid="a.420.0/1">My party plans to overtake the population of pandas before the next election&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>At the next election. In view of the fertility of pandas, that may not be a very high hurdle, but we do plan to do better than them.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/2">As for the House twiddling its thumbs, I think that the hon. Lady demeans the debates that I have announced in the forthcoming week. There is a debate on Europe. What can be more topical than that? There is the Opposition-day debate. Are they going to choose something that is of no consequence? I am amazed that she has repeated the accusation that we heard last week. The fact is we have managed the business in the House of Commons much better than the outgoing Government. We have managed to scrutinise the Government&#8217;s legislative programme with adequate time. That programme is now in another place and we will deal with the Lords amendments in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/3">I am amazed that the hon. Lady raised the issue of the debate and vote on Tuesday. We provided a debate in Government time after the autumn statement. That is something that the previous Labour Government did not always do. We had the pre-Budget report, and we did not always get a debate in Government time. Having provided a debate in Government time, the Labour party then brought it to a premature conclusion by moving that it should stop before we reached 10 o&#8217;clock. It then complained that we did not have enough time to debate the motion. A number of Labour MPs who took part in the debate then solemnly went through the Division Lobbies to assert that they had done no such thing; that they had not considered the economy. At a time when we are trying to reconnect the House of Commons with the public, I wonder whether the sort of antics that the Labour party got up to on Tuesday really advanced our cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/4">On benefits for pensioners, if the hon. Lady looks at the coalition agreement, she will see clear commitments on benefits to pensioners on bus passes and other issues and that remains the policy of the coalition Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/5">I am amazed that the hon. Lady chose to raise the subject of lobbying. For 13 years, the Labour Government did nothing about lobbying. They ignored the recommendations of the Public Administration Select Committee, which reported in 2009. By contrast, we are actually doing something about lobbying. We will produce our consultation paper within the next few weeks, proposing a statutory register of lobbyists, which is something that they consistently failed to do. On the question of boasting, I have to say that in the previous Parliament, there were ex-Labour Ministers who were boasting, while they were still Members of Parliament, of the influence that they had on Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.420.0/6">Finally, on Europe, I gently remind the hon. Lady that when we had the vote on the referendum, her party was split as were all three parties. On the Government Benches, we are delighted that the person representing this country in Europe today and tomorrow is the Prime Minister and not the Leader of the Opposition.</p>

The Government have just commissioned research from Bristol university to find out what the consequences would be of introducing a cap on the interest rates. I hope that that will be available and published in the summer and that it will inform the debate. In the meantime, I urge people to think twice before taking on high-interest loans and to contact the free money advice service, possibly through their citizens advice bureau, or to visit their local credit union, which might be able to help on better terms.</p>

	<p pid="a.431.3/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House recognises and appreciates the valuable work done by public sector workers; believes that they should receive pensions which are affordable, sustainable and fair; further believes that the changes announced since June 2010 by the Government are primarily for the purposes of deficit reduction rather than a move to secure the long-term sustainability of public sector pensions; notes that these changes are unfair on public sector workers who will have to work longer, pay more and receive less in their pension when they retire; further notes the findings of the National Audit Office that the 2007-08 pensions re-negotiation changes will generate estimated savings of 14 per cent. by 2059-60 and the conclusions of the House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts&#8217; Thirty-eighth Report of this Session on the Impact of the 2007-08 changes to public sector pensions (HC 833), that the cost of public service pensions has reduced substantially because of these changes; agrees with criticism in both reports of the failure to develop a long-term strategy for the role of pensions in recruitment and retention to the public sector; condemns the Government&#8217;s threat to cut devolved administrations&#8217; budgets if they do not implement the Government&#8217;s immediate levy on pensions contributions; and calls on the Government to reverse its unfair changes to public sector pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/3">The motion stands in the names of my right hon. and hon. Friends from the Scottish National party and Plaid Cymru, and of Members from the Labour party and, I understand, from the Social Democratic and Labour party.</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/4">Last week, a day of action saw more than 2 million people across the UK join in protests against changes that will make those affected&#8212;mainly women&#8212;work longer, pay more and receive less when they retire. This year alone, bankers walked away with &#163;7 billion in bonuses. As one constituent said to me last week:</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/5">&#8220;This is just a way of getting extra cash from public workers. And it is just not fair.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.431.3/6">We are proud to hold this debate on behalf of all those people across the UK who are directly or indirectly affected by the Government&#8217;s changes, and we note that despite having 36 Opposition day debates since the changes were announced in June 2010, the official Opposition have not seen fit to devote even one of those opportunities to debate the public sector pensions proposals. Whatever the evasions, the nods and the winks, and the ducking and diving of others, we are glad of the opportunity to show clearly where we stand.</p>

	<p pid="a.431.4/1">This is characterised as a joint debate between Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party, yet last week we saw SNP Members of the Scottish Parliament cross the picket lines to ensure that the Scottish Parliament functioned, while Plaid Cymru Members of the Welsh Assembly refused to cross picket lines and the Welsh Assembly did not function.

	<p pid="a.432.6/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.6/2">To summarise our motion, we appreciate the valuable work done by public sector workers and believe that they should receive pensions that are affordable, sustainable and fair. I think that we can have agreement across the House on that. We believe that the Government&#8217;s changes are primarily for the purposes of deficit reduction&#8212;I do not think we are going to have agreement on that&#8212;rather than to secure the long-term sustainability of public sector pensions. These changes are, to our minds, unfair on public sector workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.432.6/3">We also note that the findings of the National Audit Office for the 2007-08 period show that pensions re-negotiated at that time will generate estimated savings of 14% by 2059-60. The conclusions of the 38th report of the Public Accounts Committee reveal that the cost of public service pensions has reduced substantially because of those changes. We agree with the criticism in both reports of the failure to develop a long-term strategy for the role of pensions in recruitment and retention in the public sector, and we condemn the Government&#8217;s threat to cut the devolved Administrations&#8217; budgets if they do not implement the Government&#8217;s immediate levy.</p>

	<p pid="a.432.7/1">I am following my hon. Friend&#8217;s argument closely and I agree entirely with what he says. Does he agree that there is a link between this drive to the bottom on public sector pay and the Chancellor&#8217;s view that we should be looking at regional pay? This flexibility is all about a drive to the bottom, and it is unacceptable out there; people will not have it.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.433.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40045" speakername="Hywel Williams" colnum="433"  time="013:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0002.htm#11120860001571">
	<p pid="a.433.0/1">My right hon. Friend makes an excellent point, to which I shall return later. The Prime Minister&#8217;s numerous assurances that he is not in favour of driving down public sector pensions, and that it is not a race to the bottom as far as he is concerned, are strange in view of the actions of his Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/2">Finally, our motion calls explicitly on the Government</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/3">&#8220;to reverse its unfair changes to public sector pensions.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.433.0/4">Let me make clear from the outset that no one to whom I have spoken wanted to go on strike. Everyone wants a reasonable settlement. My nationalist party colleagues and I hope that the talks between the unions and the Government will continue, and will reach a successful conclusion in the terms that I have outlined. We understand that the unions have accepted the continued need for negotiation and further change. Perhaps the Minister who winds up the debate will tell us when the two sides met most recently in the last month, who was involved&#8212;there have been questions about who was speaking for whom&#8212;and when they intend to meet again.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman develops his argument, will he be comparing the positions of employees in the public sector with those in the private sector, who for many years have been having to increase their contributions in order to receive decent pensions?</p>

	<p pid="a.433.2/1">Government Members have deployed such arguments time and again, which is strange given that in other contexts, such as that of education, they always deny that they are lowering standards. It is not about levelling down, they say, but about levelling up&#8212;yet when it suits them, it is the other way around. The hon. Gentleman clearly was not listening when I made that point earlier.</p>

There are some very good private sector schemes and some very good public sector schemes. Some private sector schemes have gone bust, and some public sector schemes require an in-year top-up. This is not about &#8220;private good, public bad&#8221;, or the other way around. It is about having good schemes, full stop. It is about fairness, and about not levelling down in either the private or the public sector.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.4/1">The hon. Gentleman has made a good point. If Government Members are concerned about the private sector, they should be concerned about the large number of people who have no pensions at all. That is what concerns me, and concerns my colleagues.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.5/1">Certain members of the Government are suggesting, as one of their &#8220;public against private&#8221; arguments, that public sector schemes are gold-plated. In fact, the average public sector pension is about &#163;5,000 a year, and local government pensions can be as low as &#163;3,000 a year, or &#163;80 a week.</p>

	<p pid="a.433.6/1">The hon. Gentleman has anticipated a point that I was going to make, which will doubtless be made again by other nationalist party members.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.6/2">Anyone reading the popular press would imagine that public sector workers were driving around in this year&#8217;s model of car and enjoying two or three foreign holidays a year, but that is not, of course, the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.433.6/3">We say &#8220;Let us have negotiations&#8221;, but is the 3.2% imposition itself negotiable? What the Government have announced today will merely shift the burden from one group of workers to another. They are trying to squeeze out some sort of deal, but we utterly reject that way of going about things.</p>

	<p pid="a.434.0/1">I think it important for the hon. Gentleman to clarify whom he means by &#8220;we&#8221;.

	<p pid="a.434.2/1">The Minister said that a number of choices were available to the Scottish Government.

I am sure he agrees that that rather limits the choice of manoeuvre for a Government who do not want to go down that path.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.4/2">Whatever the Government say, the 3.2% is seen by workers and by the general population as an additional and carefully targeted tax, aimed largely at those who have the least means to pay. As for the negotiations, they must be based on proper evidence rather than on the cases that the Prime Minister quoted selectively during last week&#8217;s Question Time, which were so effectively debunked in Radio 4&#8217;s &#8220;'More or Less&#8221; programme and in Channel 4&#8217;s &#8220;FactCheck&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.5/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on the excellent speech that he is making. Is he aware of a study by the Fire Brigades Union, which found that 27% of its members were likely, or very likely, to leave their pension schemes if employee contributions were raised? What effect does he think that would have on the sustainability of schemes if it were translated across the public sector?</p>

	<p pid="a.435.6/1">There is clearly a danger that some schemes will become unviable, which would mean that in the longer term those who no longer had pension schemes would become even more dependent on the state. I am sure that Government Members would not want that to happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.435.7/1">I am sure I heard the hon. Gentleman say that the 3% increase in pension contributions would target those least able to pay. I believe that the average public sector wage in Wales is about &#163;26,400, compared with &#163;21,700 in the private sector. Furthermore, do not the Government&#8217;s proposals protect those earning less than &#163;15,000 a year?</p>

	<p pid="a.435.8/1">That argument fails to take several factors into account, such as the 710,000 people who will lose their jobs and the 1% pay freeze that looms before us at a time when inflation is eating into the real value of wages.</p>
	<p pid="a.435.8/2">Our constituents have gone on strike with the greatest reluctance. They are not the wild-eyed extremists so beloved of those on the Government Benches. Members of the National Association of Head Teachers&#8212;scarcely</p>
	<p pid="a.435.8/3">a hotbed of left-wing insurrection&#8212;went on strike last week for the first time in 140 years. Anna Brychan, director of the NAHT in Wales, summarised the arguments advanced by many public service workers who felt that they had no choice but to go on strike. I shall paraphrase what she said, because it was very lengthy. She said that the NAHT was not persuaded by the unsustainable and unaffordable argument. The pension changes in 2007-08, according to the figures from the National Audit Office, showed savings of 14%, but no re-evaluation has been made since the previous apparently permanent settlement. May I draw the attention of the House to my early-day motion 2198, which makes that point?</p>

	<p pid="a.436.5/1">It depends on whether they are going up or down.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.5/2">Returning to the comments made by the NAHT, I refer to the written question tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40150" name="Jonathan Edwards">the Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards)</phrase> on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-21">21 November</phrase>. In his response, the Minister of State, Department for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40097" name="Nick Gibb">the hon. Member for Bognor Regis and Littlehampton (Mr Gibb)</phrase>, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.436.5/3">&#8220;The latest valuation of the teachers&#8217; pension scheme was published in November 2006. This was the actuarial review of the scheme as at <phrase class="date" code="2004-03-31">31 March 2004</phrase>.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2011-11-21.87"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 November 2011; Vol. 536, c. 87W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.436.5/4">In other words, there has been no formal published valuation since the 2007 changes were introduced, so how can the Government claim that the scheme is unaffordable?</p>
	<p pid="a.436.5/5">The NAHT also says that contribution increases are all about plugging the deficit, not about making pensions affordable. Teachers are already doing their bit: they have a pay freeze, and below-inflation pay increases to look forward to. In respect of the higher pension age, they recognise the implications of the population living longer, as we all do. That must be debated, but we need to be sensible. Teaching, the NAHT says, is physically and emotionally demanding, and expecting people to do it at 68 is &#8220;an ask too far&#8221;. That is also the view of other unions that I have consulted. Shane Price, my local Fire Brigades Union representative, asked me:</p>
	<p pid="a.436.5/6">&#8220;Would you want, or expect, to be carried out, coughing and spluttering from a blazing building by a 68 year old fireman?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.436.5/7">Clearly not. In any event, says the NAHT, the changes will distort the age profile of the profession. There is a need to ensure a throughput of young people, and that will be jeopardised. Younger teachers will be affected most by the proposed pension scheme, and they may opt out altogether, as we have discussed.</p>
	<p pid="a.436.5/8">The NAHT says that this is an attack on education. It wants to attract the brightest and the best&#8212;that is what pupils deserve&#8212;and while the salaries are not great given the demands of the job, the professional rewards are enormous. We cannot afford for people to discount those professional rewards because their conditions of service are dramatically reduced. These are serious, responsible points. They are made, it is true, by people who are looking after their own interest, but uppermost in their mind is the future of our children, the future of education and of the teaching profession in general.</p>

	<p pid="a.437.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way&#8212;he has been extremely generous in accepting interventions. Having read the motion, I agree with almost all of it, particularly the part in which he identifies who is responsible for the attack on public sector pension schemes.

	<p pid="a.437.1/1">The bulk of my speech, as one would expect, is about the Government&#8217;s proposals, but the hon. Gentleman will have to wait and see.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/2">Lleu Williams from University and College Union Wales told me:</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/3">&#8220;We are pleased that MPs will debate public sector pensions a week after tens of thousands of people in Wales took industrial action to show how angry they are&#8230;The action last week, alongside the debate on public sector pensions, is testament to the strength of feeling on these issues&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/4">in Wales. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/5">&#8220;We hope today&#8217;s debate sends a clear message from the people of Wales to Westminster that we will not go quietly into the night over these proposed changes.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/6">I have heard from the other side that union members did not support the strike&#8212;they have deserted the cause, as it were. UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, confirms that it saw record recruitment levels both before and after the strike. That gives the lie to that one. Finally, the National Union of Teachers welcomes today&#8217;s debate and says that rather than creating an unnecessary and damaging divide between the public and private sectors, Ministers would do well to focus their attention on securing fair pensions for all if future Governments are to avoid pensioner poverty on an unaffordable scale, which is the point that I made earlier regarding future dependence on state benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/7">I shall refer briefly to that bunch of hard, crazed revolutionaries, the British Medical Association, which strongly opposes the plans set out by the Government to reform the NHS pension scheme, including increased contributions from doctors; raising the standard pensionable age for staff; and devaluing many pension settlements. It queries whether the NHS pension scheme is in need of reform, given that it underwent a major overhaul only three years ago. It says that the scheme is in very</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/8">good financial health, and generates a surplus for the Treasury. Indeed, over the seven years from 2009-10 to 2014-15, the NHS pension scheme is expected to provide a surplus of &#163;10.7 billion for the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/9">The BMA is engaged with the Governments in Westminster and in the devolved nations on the proposed reforms to pensions, but it has not ruled out balloting members on industrial action over the matter. It is thinking of moving towards action, and its decision will be informed by a ballot at the beginning of the year. That is just a sample of the views and arguments that we have heard&#8212;there are plenty more.</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/10">One of my constituents, a small business person&#8212;such people are often cited by the Government as those who would suffer as a result of the strike&#8212;said to me on the day of the strike:</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/11">&#8220;They&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/12">the Government here in London&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/13">&#8220;think that people like me don&#8217;t support the strike. They&#8217;re wrong. A lot of my business comes from county council workers. How will I keep going if they don&#8217;t have the money to spend?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.437.1/14">That shows the interaction and co-dependence of the public and private sectors in areas such as mine.</p>

	<p pid="a.438.0/1">If that argument is to be sustained, is it not logical that the way to resolve the economic problem is simply to make the public sector as big as possible, and the private sector can then profit?</p>

	<p pid="a.438.1/1">I am surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman arguing for that. I thought he took the contrary view, but perhaps my sense of irony is underdeveloped.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/2">The Office for Budget Responsibility estimated in March 2011 that 400,000 people in the public sector would lose their jobs. In its response to the autumn statement, that rose by nearly 80% to a disastrous 710,000. One further, crucial reason as to why we in Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party have called this debate is that public sector jobs are disproportionately important to countries and regions outside London and the south-east. Paying an extra 3% out of their wages is bad for individuals wherever they live, and I have particular sympathy for those in inner-city areas with high costs such as public service workers in central London. Looking across the UK, the 3% imposition and the job losses will have a particularly strong impact on Scotland, Wales and the north of England, especially as the private sector is generally weaker in those areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/3">That will be even more the case if the Government follow Labour&#8217;s lead in 2008 and introduce regional rates of pay, as my hon. Friends have said. The figures on the size of the public sector are clear, sad and revealing. Briefly, in Scotland the public sector accounts for 28.6% of jobs; in the east the figure is 23.7%; in the north-east it is 29.4%; in the south- east it is 22.8%; in Wales, unfortunately the figure is highest at 31.2%; and in London it is 22%. There is a clear north-south divide. The people we represent will be hit particularly hard, as will our local economies because of the grotesquely distorted, south-east-weighted economic development of the UK and the obsession with the City of London.</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/4">This morning I received an e-mail from Mr Mark Rowe, a PCS member from the Devon area. I do not know Mr Rowe; I have never met him, and I do not know what his politics are, but he said this in his e-mail:</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/5">&#8220;Dear Mr Williams, Thank you for supporting hard working public servants in their struggle over pensions. It is good to know that someone is. We had a huge rally through Torquay on the 30th, hardly a &#8216;damp squib&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.438.1/6">as it was described by the Government. He added that there had been &#8220;much public support&#8221; and asked why Labour are not &#8220;fighting our corner&#8221;. Public sector pensions have not been the subject of a single full Opposition day debate in the House for the past 18 months, despite the fact that Labour has had 36 Opposition day debates since the public sector pension changes were first introduced in 2010.</p>

	<p pid="a.439.6/1">I do realise that&#8212;and that may be the only point on which I agree with the hon. Lady.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/2">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40045" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase> for opening the debate. He spoke for about 20 minutes, and in that time he at least said exactly the same about Scottish National party policy on this issue as was revealed in a two-and-a-half-hour debate in the Scottish Parliament last week, which was precisely nothing. I will return to that subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/3">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" name="Sheila Gilmore">the hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore)</phrase> has already mentioned, no Member would disagree with the following sentiments in the motion:</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/4">&#8220;That this House recognises and appreciates the valuable work done by public sector workers&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/5">and</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/6">&#8220;believes that they should receive pensions which are affordable, sustainable and fair&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/7">Indeed, those sentiments form the foundations of our reform of public service pensions. Our objective is to put in place new schemes that are affordable, sustainable and fair both to taxpayers and public service workers. Let us be clear: public service pension reform is needed. The costs have increased by a third in the last 10 years, to &#163;32 billion, and the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts that, without reform, spending on pensions will rise by almost &#163;7 billion over the next five years.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/8">Understandably, this is a contentious issue, but fairness remains the cornerstone of our approach. We believe that public service workers deserve a good pension in retirement, as a fair reward for a lifetime spent serving the public. We recognise the vital contributions made by teachers, nurses, council employees and civil servants to the well-being of our society now and in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/9">That is why in June 2010 my right hon. Friend the Chancellor commissioned Lord Hutton, a Work and Pensions Secretary in the previous Government, to take an unbiased and clear-headed look at public service pensions and make proposals for reform. His landmark report has set the parameters of the debate, and it has been rightly lauded for its depth and vision.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/10">Lord Hutton set out an overwhelming case for reform. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/11">&#8220;the status quo is not tenable&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/12">that</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/13">&#8220;future costs are inherently uncertain&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/14">and that at present the public</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/15">&#8220;cannot be sure that schemes will remain sustainable in the future.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/16">In his interim report, he found that there was a clear justification, based on the past cost increases borne by the taxpayer, to increase contributions in the short term to ensure a fairer distribution of costs between taxpayers and members. We accepted that recommendation, and increases in member contributions will take place, starting next year. However, next year&#8217;s increase merely reflects the increase already planned by the previous Government. We remain committed to securing in full the overall savings of &#163;2.3 billion in 2013-14 and &#163;2.8 billion in 2014-15 that we announced at the 2010 spending review.</p>
	<p pid="a.439.6/17">In his final report, Lord Hutton produced a blueprint for a new landscape of public service pensions. It is based on retaining defined-benefit schemes but moving to a fairer career-average basis, and increasing the retirement age in line with the state pension age to protect the taxpayer against future increases in life expectancy.</p>

	<p pid="a.443.6/2">We have set out our proposals. When we make our reforms, the taxpayer needs to be properly protected from the future risks arising from increases in life expectancy by the link between the scheme normal pension age and the state pension age. On <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-02">2 November</phrase>, after months of negotiations with the trade unions, the Government set out a revised offer that was more generous by 8%.</p>
	<p pid="a.443.6/3">The offer is generous. Most staff on low and middle incomes will retire on a pension that is as good as what they expect today, and for many it will be better. Lord Hutton has said that it is difficult &#8220;to imagine&#8221; a more generous offer. The offer includes generous transitional arrangements for those closest to retirement; those closest to retirement should not have to face any change at all. This approach mirrors the steps taken in relation to increases in the state pension age, and it is fair that the same applies here. Anyone 10 years or less from retirement age on <phrase class="date" code="2012-04-01">1 April 2012</phrase> can be assured that there will be no detriment to their retirement income. However, this enhanced offer is conditional upon reaching agreement. It is an offer that can inform the scheme-by-scheme talks which will continue until the end of the year. Of</p>
	<p pid="a.443.6/4">course, if agreement cannot be reached, the Government may be required to revisit our proposals and consider whether those enhancements remain appropriate.</p>

Friend the Chief Secretary will update the House in due course. The Government&#8217;s preferred scheme would produce better pensions for those on low and middle incomes who have devoted a lifetime to public service. At the same time, public service pensions will remain considerably better than those available in the private sector, as my hon. Friends have suggested. A primary school teacher earning &#163;32,000 per year could receive a pension of &#163;20,000 under our proposals. To earn the equivalent pension in the private sector, an employee would have to pay more than one third of their salary.</p>

	<p pid="a.444.2/1">Several of my constituents who work in the private sector have told me that they totally agree that public sector workers should get sustainable, affordable and fair pensions, but they are concerned that for them to have a similar pension they would have to increase their contributions by a factor of three or four. They do not think that that is fair in the current circumstances.</p>

Is the Minister aware that the average pension of a retiring teacher is &#163;9,000 per annum, and that the figures for NHS workers, for civil servants and for members of the armed forces are &#163;7,000 per annum, &#163;6,000 per annum and &#163;7,500 per annum respectively?

	<p pid="a.444.5/2">The report mentions two reports, one by the National Audit Office and the other by the Public Accounts Committee, which do not provide us with sustainable and lasting models for the future. Pensions, as they stand, are not affordable. As Lord Hutton says,</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/3">&#8220;the status quo is not tenable.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.444.5/4">The Office for Budget Responsibility&#8217;s latest forecast demonstrates that long-term costs have continued to increase since March, so reform is now essential because the costs of public service pensions have risen dramatically over the past few decades. The fact is that we are all living longer; the average 60-year-old is living 10 years longer than was the case in the 1970s.</p>

	<p pid="a.446.6/3">The Treasury wrote to tell the Scottish Government they had to apply the 3.2% increase in contributions or make up the shortfall and presented them with a choice. They could have chosen not to apply the increased contributions and make up the difference to the Treasury, but they followed a now familiar pattern: they failed to take any sort of decision and blamed Westminster at every turn. Their manufactured outrage is a smokescreen designed to cover the fact that they have no answers for the people of Scotland on how they would fund public sector pensions, never mind the wider state pension.

The SNP&#8217;s submission to Lord Hutton, as we have heard, offered at best no better and in some cases a much worse deal. The Scottish Public Pensions Agency, an agency of the Scottish Government, headed by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth, John Swinney, made a number of interesting suggestions when it illustrated options for further change. It suggested reducing current employer contribution cap levels with members meeting all costs above that cap. Alongside that, it proposed to reduce the levels of benefits available without necessarily reducing the levels of contributions.</p>

	<p pid="a.448.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an interesting point, because that is one issue on which there is an absolute divide between Plaid Cymru and the SNP. Plaid Cymru wants significant change to the Barnett formula and, as I understand it, the SNP does not. That is part of the inherent illogicality that is at the heart of their argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.2/2">I am surprised that we hear nothing these days about independence, which is relevant. Perhaps that is because Plaid Cymru does not promote independence. I look forward to hearing SNP Members set out exactly how an independent Scotland would be able to fund not only existing pensions, but provide enhanced pensions, without consequences for pensioners in Scotland. I am sure that we will hear calls for the break up of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.448.2/3">I also look forward to hearing from Labour Members. I understand that Labour MSPs chose not to take part in the debate in the Scottish Parliament because they were working in their constituencies that day. I know that the Labour party has not been an effective Opposition in Holyrood, particularly since <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40272" name="Margaret Curran">the hon.

Let me begin by paying tribute to the contribution made by those who work in our public services, including 595,000 in Scotland, such as those who care for the sick and elderly in hospitals and care homes, those who provide inspiration to children through the gift of teaching and those who clean up our communities. They are the backbone of our society. They had no part in causing the great recession or the slump in tax revenues and demand in 2008-09. They deserve better treatment from the Government, whose economic policy is based on a further 310,000 of them being made redundant by the end of this Parliament, and their families suffering an uncertain future, and all because of the Chancellor&#8217;s adherence to a deflationary economic theory that is not working and is sapping hope and potential from communities across our country.</p>

We can see from the economic illiteracy of the previous Budget and the autumn statement that to have adopted a deflationary policy at that time would have seen unemployment and public sector redundancies soar even higher. That is not the approach that would have safeguarded a recovery, and it is one that we were right to reject.</p>

	<p pid="a.449.2/1">I will give way to the hon. Gentleman later.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/2">Today&#8217;s concessions by the Secretary of State for Health on NHS pension contributions show that the Government&#8217;s plans are already unravelling under the weight of their own contradictions and injustices. Is it not disgraceful that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury did not come to the House today to make a statement on the details of this partial climbdown, instead of the Government briefing the press?</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/3">By first sight, the concessions stand up to no more scrutiny than the Government&#8217;s previous partial climbdown, which would have required a near 50% increase in annual contributions from affected workers, for up to eight years longer, with the claimed increased pensions paid for as much as eight years fewer, losing real terms value each year due to uprating in line with the consumer prices index rather than the retail prices index. Unison has already said in response to today&#8217;s announcements that a one-year delay before low-paid workers will pay higher contributions is cold comfort.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/4">This is the Government who refuse to impose a tax on bank bonuses, but believe that nurses, teachers and catering staff should face additional tax rises instead. This is the Government who in the autumn statement sought to slash &#163;1.2 billion a year from the tax credits of these same workers, hurting women and children four times more heavily than the balance sheets of the banks. We need a negotiated solution in which both sides give ground. The Opposition accept many of Lord Hutton&#8217;s points, but the Government pre-empted this with the hike in contributions, which must be subject to negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/5">Let me set out the reasons why we find the Government&#8217;s current proposals unacceptable and urge them to produce plans for the future of public sector pensions that genuinely do not penalise those who are least able to shoulder the burden. First, the Chancellor&#8217;s proposals are not about fairness or long-term stability. They are motivated by a reckless plan of spending reductions that are made worse by his failure to grow the economy in the last year and the slump in growth that the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts for this year, next year and the year after. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury set out in the comprehensive spending review last October cuts in the public sector pension bill from next April of more than &#163;1 billion, rising to &#163;2.8 billion by 2014-15, coming from the 3.2% hike in contributions paid by 750,000 public sector workers, all as part of the</p>
	<p pid="a.449.2/6">Government&#8217;s plan to take &#163;81 billion out of the economy by 2015 through public spending cuts. However, with the lack of demand and growth the biggest problem facing the country today, how will reducing the living standards of hundreds of thousands of public sector workers on top of the two-year pay freeze increase consumer confidence or strengthen the retail and service sectors, which will be harmed by this tax on public sector workers?</p>

	<p pid="a.450.5/2">The Government are attempting to create the politics of division between low-paid workers in the private and public sectors and to engage in a race to the bottom on public sector pensions instead of focusing on increasing provision among employees in the private sector, but the public will not be fooled. Cutting a dinner lady&#8217;s pension will do nothing to increase the pension of a call centre worker or end unfairness in private pension provision. Two in three private sector workers are not in a workplace pension scheme. Two in three public sector staff earning between &#163;100 and &#163;200 a week are in a pension scheme, but only one in seven private sector workers in the same wage band are in a pension. Only 11% of private sector employees are in defined benefit pension schemes. The Government simply fail to grasp or take action on the unfairness in the pension packages of top directors in the private sector, who have pensions worth nearly &#163;4 million on average.</p>

	<p pid="a.450.7/2">The average public sector pension in local government is &#163;3,000 a year, and half of female public sector pensioners receive less than &#163;4,000 a year, or &#163;80 a week. As Lord Hutton&#8217;s report makes clear, the notion that current</p>
	<p pid="a.450.7/3">public sector pensions are gold-plated is entirely wrong. The Government&#8217;s plans mean that a part-time 45-year-old school dinner lady with five years&#8217; service, who is in the local government pension scheme and on a salary of &#163;8,000 per year, would receive &#163;400 a year less in her pension by the age of 65, or &#163;672 a year less if she took it at 68, while she would pay &#163;5,500 more in contributions by her retirement.</p>

Gentleman has to explain to the Scottish people why the Chief Secretary to the Treasury now proposes further austerity, with &#163;23 billion more in cuts in the first two years of the next Parliament, and to explain its effect on the lives of the Scottish people. The switch is a permanent change that will still hurt ordinary families even after the public finances have been restored to stability. The Government&#8217;s proposals harm those who are within 10 years of retirement and would have to pay the 3.2% increase in contributions for a pension that would be 15% smaller due to the Government&#8217;s changes to contributions and indexation.</p>

	<p pid="a.451.5/1">I will in a second. I just want to make further progress on this point. I will allow the hon. Gentleman in.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/2">The Government&#8217;s plans measure income with reference not to gross pay, but to full-time equivalent earnings, treating a part-time employee on a salary of &#163;14,000 a year as if they were a full-time employee on a salary of &#163;28,000 a year. The Office for National Statistics&#8217; own figures from last year show that 806,000 public sector workers who work part-time earn less than &#163;15,000 but</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/3">have full-time equivalent earnings above that amount. Of that number, 91% are women. Only 16% of public sector workers have full-time equivalent earnings of less than &#163;15,000 a year and would escape the rise in contributions. The 3% hike in contributions means that some women would pay almost 50% more in pension contributions.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/4">Secondly, the OBR&#8217;s fiscal sustainability report, published this July, makes it clear that, even without implementing the recommendations in the Hutton report but taking into account the likely rise in the elderly population, the cost of providing public sector pensions as a proportion of GDP will fall from 2% to 1.8% by 2030, and to 1.6% by 2060. Lord Hutton has not disagreed that, even without those changes, the costs of providing public sector pensions in the long term are sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/5">The previous Government signed an agreement with civil service unions, ensuring that new civil servants entered a career-average scheme with a pension age of 65 years old, thereby benefiting low-paid workers whose pay rises are generally less than inflation and who are unlikely to benefit from regular promotions. The agreement helped in particular women, black and ethnic minority workers and people with disabilities. The National Audit Office, in December 2010, evaluated that 2007 deal and concluded that it</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/6">&#8220;reduces costs to taxpayers by 14 per cent&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/7">saving &#163;67 billion over the lifetime of existing schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/8">Thirdly, a 3.2% increase in contributions by public sector workers in return for a lower pension would fail the test of fairness at a time when people on low and middle incomes face the biggest squeeze in living standards since the 1920s. For a public sector worker on average pay, the effect of this further attack on living standards is to the tune of a &#163;3,000 cut in gross pay. A worker on a salary of &#163;18,000 per year could lose more than &#163;1,500 over the years from next April.</p>
	<p pid="a.451.5/9">Fourthly, average incomes are set to fall by 7.4% by the end of this Parliament&#8212;the largest slump on record, and all because of this Government&#8217;s economic failure; and disposable incomes are set to fall by 4%, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies in data published last Wednesday. Imposing a higher tax on public sector workers at such a time, with those trends in falling disposable income, is grossly inequitable. The hike in pension contributions, together with the current pay freeze and the future 1% pay cap, will lead to an average 16% cut in living standards by 2014 for public sector workers.</p>

The Scottish Government have power over the NHS, teachers, local government, police and firefighters pension schemes, with the exception of the local government pension scheme. They have not yet declared what they intend do in relation to local government workers, who face the possibility of paying additional contributions to their pensions, so they should end that uncertainty and make their position clear now.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.1/3">The Government need to change course, to sustain and not destroy the living standards of public sector workers and to recognise that the crushing austerity that they seek to entrench for years to come will leave a legacy of higher child and family poverty. This country deserves better than a Government who are out of touch, out of growth and out of ideas for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.453.4/1">I had hoped, when I saw the text of the motion, that there would be some maturity in this debate about public pensions, which have become unaffordable and unsustainable in the long term, but I should have known better. The speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40274" name="William Bain">the hon. Member for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain)</phrase> was disappointingly partisan and failed to address the long-term sustainability problems that we face.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.4/2">It is a truism that every Member of this House appreciates the valuable work done by our public sector workers, and it is not very helpful for any Opposition Member to try to paint Government Members as anti-public sector. I speak as someone who spent almost the entirety of my career working in the public sector, having worked for the police service, in local government, and as a regulator. Among my hon. Friends, we have NHS doctors, ex-servicemen and ex-teachers, so we have as much interest in supporting our public sector workers as any party in this House. However, we also recognise the need for long-term fiscal responsibility and acknowledge that in delivering to public sector</p>
	<p pid="a.453.4/3">workers pensions that are affordable, sustainable and fair, that fairness has to apply to those workers and to the taxpayer. As currently constituted, our pensions are not affordable in the long term, for the simple reason that we are all living longer.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.4/4">The motion suggests&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40045" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase> referred to this&#8212;that these public sector pension reforms are about deficit reduction. Given the time frame in which the Government are implementing the changes and the intention to implement them on a phased basis, I am satisfied that that criticism does not bear examination. These changes are about fiscal responsibility and about not saddling future generations of taxpayers with huge tax liabilities. This is not a short-term fix; it is about getting an appropriate balance between the contributions of workers and the contribution of the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.4/5">The motion notes that the changes</p>
	<p pid="a.453.4/6">&#8220;are unfair on public sector workers&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.453.4/7">because they</p>
	<p pid="a.453.4/8">&#8220;will have to work longer, pay more and receive less in their pension when they retire&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.4/9">I have to say to the House that that is the reality for all pension holders. In my last job, I paid into a private pension, and I have just had a look at how much it is worth. In the space of just two months, the value of that pension pot has eroded by some 25%. I suspect that many workers are having to revise their intentions with regard to retirement when they look at how their pension is performing, not least because of the annual raid on pension funds perpetrated by the previous Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.454.0/1">My hon. Friend&#8217;s point about support for public sector workers is absolutely correct. The fundamental question is about fairness. Opposition Members are saying that people on lower earnings in the private sector should work longer hours and pay more tax in order to guarantee the pension being provided to public sector workers, while those lower-earning private sector workers often have no provision at all. It is about fairness, and that means that this Government have to take the tough decisions, however unpopular, to put the situation right.</p>

	<p pid="a.454.3/2">I welcome the fact that in our proposed reforms we are sticking with defined benefit systems.

	<p pid="a.455.0/1">One of the things that might have brought more money in and created some fairness in the pensions system would have been to limit the tax relief on payments into private pensions to the basic rate of tax. Would the hon. Lady agree with that proposal?</p>

	<p pid="a.455.1/1">I am trying to set out a case for wider structural reform. We have a massive structural challenge across the board in pensions for public sector workers and private sector workers. As regards tax relief for pension contributions, I will not take any lectures from Labour Members given what was done under the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/2">It used to be the case that the generous pension provision for public sector workers was a quid pro quo for working in the public sector, as higher salaries were traditionally enjoyed more regularly in the private sector. That is no longer the case. I refer to the comments by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40035" name="Guto Bebb">the Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb)</phrase> about average salaries in Wales, which show that public sector workers there often enjoy much higher levels of reward than private sector workers. This will reduce dynamism in the labour market and make us less competitive. Our economy benefits greatly from having people moving from the public sector into the private sector so that we all enjoy their expertise, but when there are such significant levels of differential between salaries, that is not going to happen. If we then add in the benefits that come from the generous pension provision, it becomes impossible for people to move from one job to another.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.1/3">Let me give an example. In my last job, I worked for the Financial Services Authority, where I had a very senior colleague who had worked for the Bank of England and the FSA for some 28 years. She was offered a very highly paid job with a bank, as one would expect&#8212;we all expect bankers to be offered higher salaries than public sector workers. When she worked out the cost implications of moving from her job, with 28 years of a final salary pension, compared with what she would have to be paid by the bank to come anywhere close, she was somewhat crest-fallen to realise that in the longer term she would be taking a pay cut. That illustrates the competitiveness issues raised by how much we have in our pension schemes.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.2/1">In areas such as Wales and the north of England, where the discrepancy is particularly notable, small businesses and enterprises need people but they are struggling to recruit because of the level of salaries in the public sector. If we are to rebalance the economy, we need to make sure that our dynamic small businesses have equal and fair access to the labour market.</p>

	<p pid="a.455.3/1">That is absolutely true. It is not very good for growth and competitiveness if we are pricing growing businesses out of the market simply because they cannot afford to recruit staff at sustainable levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.3/2">The motion refers to the reports by the National Audit Office and the Public Accounts Committee. I am a member of the Public Accounts Committee. While it is true that we were pleased that the reforms introduced by the previous Government were moving in the right direction, we were not satisfied that they were sustainable in the long term. The NAO would not be drawn on that specific issue, because it recognised that it was a political decision. The PAC said that the Hutton commission provided the opportunity for the Government to develop a clear strategic direction for public service pensions and that we looked forward to those detailed proposals. The Public Accounts Committee report was therefore much more sympathetic to the Government&#8217;s approach than is indicated in the motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.3/3">That said, the Committee did express concerns about pension reform. We expressed concern over its impact on staff morale. It would be helpful if employers and trade unions worked more collaboratively to address that. Sadly, that has not been the case to date. We also expressed the opinion that many employees did not understand the value of their pensions as part of their reward. If the colleague I mentioned earlier, who worked in financial services, did not understand the true value of her pension pot, God help any other public sector worker.</p>
	<p pid="a.455.3/4">We must ensure that we do not discourage people from saving for retirement. I therefore welcome the Government&#8217;s decision to exclude the lower-paid from any increases. Obviously, 15% of salary is a lot&#8212;</p>

In relation to the final part of the motion, the SNP gave away its choices in refusing the opportunity that it had in the Scottish Parliament to vary taxes by 3p.

	<p pid="a.457.5/1">The hon. Gentleman obviously does not understand what I have just said. It is clear that most people do not understand that pension contributions by an employer are deferred income. They are part of a person&#8217;s income and should be treated as such regardless of whether they are in the private or public sector. That should be known to everybody.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.5/2">The increase in contributions that was announced in the spending review will not be used to pay for pensions. My understanding is that that &#163;2.8 billion is specifically to be used to reduce the deficit&#8212;that is in the Red Book. Perhaps the Minister would like to establish in his winding-up speech whether that is right. I also</p>
	<p pid="a.457.5/3">understand that the proposal was a political choice by the Government rather than being made out of necessity. They have scrapped Labour&#8217;s tax on bankers&#8217; bonuses, which was to raise more than &#163;3 billion in revenue, and replaced it with a tax on public sector workers&#8217; incomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.457.5/4">Those changes are being made against a backdrop of a two-year pay freeze for public sector workers, which of course was announced on the eve of last week&#8217;s strike. That was a very provocative statement intended, I suggest, to fan the flames of dissent among public sector workers. The changes also come at a time when inflation is running at about 5%. That in itself has reduced the value of public sector pay by almost 10% in real terms, which is not sustainable in the current climate. We all understand that we have difficult choices to make, and we all understand the state of the economy, but pensions should be considered for the long term. It is patent that that is not happening.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.2/2">This is an important debate, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute. One of the disappointments so far has been the fact that many Opposition Members have implied that coalition Members, whether they are Liberals or Conservatives, despise the public sector in some way. That is simply not the case, and I refute the suggestion completely. As a coalition Member, I find such comments offensive. I depend on state schools for the education of my children, I am the son of teachers and I am married to a public sector worker, so I find such comments completely unfair. Opposition Members should consider the matter carefully before making them.</p>

	<p pid="a.458.4/1">That is an interesting question, and I am not sure. My father certainly ended up voting Conservative, but I cannot comment on my mother, because I think that how somebody votes at the ballot box is their choice entirely.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.4/2">We are quite often accused of attacking the public sector or introducing unfair policies, yet the coalition Government are trying to deal on a long-term basis with issues that the previous Labour Government did not deal with. When we talk about fairness, which is important in this debate, I wonder where the comments of Labour Members were on the raid on private sector pensions. Where were their comments in defence of people with poor rates of pension provision who were saving with their own money&#8212;working people saving for their retirement? Where was the Labour party when it came to defending those people when the previous Labour Government raided pensions to the tune of &#163;5 billion a year? That was a scandal. It was not fair, but we heard nothing from Labour Members.</p>
	<p pid="a.458.4/3">Even worse, the raid on private pensions was made with the justification of helping young people back into work. In 2010, the rate of unemployment among young people was higher than in 1997. The raid was unjustified, not effective and unfair.</p>

	<p pid="a.459.2/1">The Select Committee on Children, Schools and Families held an inquiry into young people not in education, employment or training. It showed that before the economic crisis, the number of unemployed young people was on a level plane with the number when the previous Government took office. That shows that in all those years of economic growth, young people were left behind by the Labour Government before the spike after the financial crisis.

	<p pid="a.459.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for the clarity of his point.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.3/2">The proposal is a reasonable one. We are aiming to protect those on lower pay. Some in my constituency of Aberconwy will be astounded by the figure given by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40274" name="William Bain">the hon. Member for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain)</phrase>&#8212;he stated that only 16% of public sector workers earn less than &#163;15,000. The average wage in my constituency is &#163;23,000 and the average private sector wage in Wales is &#163;21,000, so there will be a question as to whether the proposal is unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.3/3">That reminds me of the comments made on the CPI to RPI change. The change was illustrated with the example of a nurse or dinner lady who earns &#163;8,000 a year. I recently did a call-in programme on Radio</p>
	<p pid="a.459.3/4">Cymru. A headmaster from the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40045" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase>, as it happens, called in and stated that the change from RPI to CPI was extremely unfair because it would cost him &#163;200,000. The average private sector pension pot is &#163;30,000. Hon. Members can imagine that the response of the general public when they heard that comment was pretty strong. The changes that the Government are trying to make are changes for the long-term, to try to ensure that we have a system that works.</p>
	<p pid="a.459.3/5">It is imperative that hon. Members mention some of the e-mails that they have received from the trade union movement. I received one this morning from the Public and Commercial Services Union stating that the claim that the coalition is trying to protect the lower paid is not sustainable. The PCS directs us to a comment by Cathy Newman, who says that it is &#8220;fanciful&#8221; for the coalition Government to try to claim that they are protecting the lower paid. I am disappointed with that comment, but then the PCS does not bother to remind us of other comments that Cathy Newman has made. She also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.459.3/6">&#8220;Having said that though, public sector pensions, even after these reforms, will still be the envy of many a worker in private enterprise.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.459.3/7">That is the key point in Wales. We are looking at how we can ensure that the people who benefit from extremely good pensions contribute a fair amount towards them. For example, will increasing a teacher&#8217;s pension contribution from 6% to 9% have an impact on their take-home pay? Yes, it will&#8212;I would be the first to acknowledge that&#8212;but it is important to state that to end up with a pension similar to what will be available to a teacher as a result of the changes, somebody working in the private sector would have to contribute 35% or 38% of their take-home pay.</p>

I ask any Opposition Member to tell me what is unfair about asking a teacher to contribute 9% of salary for a pension that a comparable worker in the private sector would have to contribute 35% to achieve.

	<p pid="a.460.3/1">I want to get a few points in about Wales to finish.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.3/2">In this debate, Plaid Cymru Members have said that they are standing up for their electorate and their workers. I applaud them for that. Of course people need to stand up for those who elect them to this place, but it is also important to point out that the constituency of the parliamentary leader of Plaid Cymru has the highest rate of self-employed people in the United Kingdom. What has Plaid said about supporting the pension provision of those individuals?</p>
	<p pid="a.460.3/3">I accept that Wales has a high percentage of people working in the public sector, but in many constituencies the majority of people are striving to earn a living in the private sector. When we have a limited amount of money, the Government have a responsibility to all taxpayers to ensure that we have a system of pension provision that is fair to all. It is simply not sustainable to expect the three quarters of the people in Wales who work in the private sector or are self-employed&#8212;many of whom live in the constituencies of Plaid Cymru Members&#8212;to pay through their taxes for the pensions of those who will retire on better pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.3/4">These changes will ensure that the public sector is protected, but they will share the burden in a slightly fairer way than at the moment, and I applaud the coalition for bringing forward a long-term change with courage and commitment.</p>

	<p pid="a.461.0/1">I congratulate the SNP and Plaid Cymru on their choice of debate today. I take part in this debate with a heavy heart, and with genuine anger and frustration at the way in which public sector workers, who have done such invaluable work in our communities, have been treated by this Government. Some of what I have to say is constructive reinforcement of points already made, rather than unnecessary duplication. These raw sentiments reflect the views of hundreds of public sector workers in my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/2">One of the hallmarks of a civilised society is the way we treat our citizens&#8212;people who have contributed immensely to society throughout their working lives. Indeed, for years there was a genuine trust and confidence in the public sector that, in return for often smaller salaries&#8212;although sometimes not&#8212;compared to the private sector, they would receive a fair, if generally modest, pension on retirement, and those pensions had been negotiated in good faith. That trust has well and truly evaporated. However, that erosion in trust has not occurred because of the Hutton report, which recognised again the need to review pension contributions as people live longer, but because of the cavalier way this Government have proceeded, on a unilateral basis, to disguise the real purpose of the precipitate 3% increase for public sector workers. To put it bluntly, public sector workers feel that they are sacrificial lambs.</p>
	<p pid="a.461.0/3">The immediate increase has nothing directly to do with the present affordability, fairness and sustainability of public sector pensions, but everything to do with a cynical attack on ordinary working people at a time of pay freezes, increased VAT, higher fuel costs and a dramatic increase in living costs. The real reason for this smash and grab raid on the public sector was blatantly to contribute to the deficit reduction plan, as highlighted by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40045" name="Hywel Williams">the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.461.1/1">I have listened carefully to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s argument and he seems to be saying that he supports the proposals in the Hutton report, but does not support what the Government have done. Which aspects of what the Government are doing are not in the Hutton report?</p>

	<p pid="a.462.0/1">The Government pre-empted Hutton and were precipitate in taking forward the action with the 3% increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/2">Not only have public sector workers been penalised, but the wealthier owners in our society, particularly the bankers, have not been challenged in the same way. As taxpayers, we have bailed out the bankers, so some of the richest people in our society continue to be rewarded, and it was some of them who created this financial crisis. Patently, we are not all in this together.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/3">As a cover for their actions, the Government continue to peddle a number of myths, which, if Members will pardon the pun, I will try to scotch. First, it is said that public sector pensions are gold-plated. As we have heard, there are varying figures for this, but they vary between &#163;3,000 to &#163;5,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.0/4">Secondly, it is said that the public sector unions were spoiling for confrontation. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

	<p pid="a.462.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a powerful point, and many of us have sympathy for those on small and medium incomes, but there are people on large incomes who also receive very large pensions. People pay taxation to provide those high pensions and that is a matter of concern.</p>

	<p pid="a.462.2/1">I do not want to be drawn to the lowest common denominator. We have already heard the issues surrounding tax relief in the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.2/2">Industrial action is a last resort and a signal of anger and frustration among our constituents. Most of my constituents had never taken industrial action in their life and hope not to do so again.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.2/3">The third myth was that the immediate 3% increase was recommended by Hutton; it was not. The fourth is that the intensive and serious negotiations between senior Ministers and senior trade union officials had continued right up until the 11th hour; they had not. Senior leaders last met on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-02">2 November</phrase>. To add insult to injury, this coalition Government decided to break the pension link with the retail prices index and the consumer prices index, thereby having a significant detrimental effect on the value of pensions, with a drop of between 11% and 14%.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.2/4">All mainstream political parties fully recognise that there needs to be a comprehensive review of public sector pensions to ensure fairness, sustainability and affordability. At no time did we pretend that challenging decisions would not have to be made about contributions, entitlement and retirement age. Reform was to be strategic and phased and it would inevitably involve difficult decisions as people are living longer. It is now incumbent on the Government to engage as a matter of urgency in serious and meaningful negotiations at the most senior level and as immediately as possible with trade unions to agree an acceptable settlement.</p>
	<p pid="a.462.2/5">Fundamentally, we need to draw up a long-term plan for decent pensions in the public sector, to continue to engage high-quality recruits, to retain the many committed public servants who do a tremendous job on our behalf and to award fairly those who reach their pension age. I therefore urge the Government to go home and think</p>
	<p pid="a.462.2/6">again, rescind these unfair short-term changes and to bring to the table a fair, affordable and sustainable plan for long-term pension reform.</p>

In my short contribution to this debate, I should like to focus on what I think is the Scottish nationalists&#8217; real motive behind the motion and the debate on public sector pension reform&#8212;their ambition for the Scottish Parliament to have full control over public sector pensions as part of its drive towards fiscal autonomy and full separation. Let me draw the House&#8217;s attention to the words last week of the First Minister, Alex Salmond:</p>
	<p pid="a.463.0/2">&#8220;The way to stop this Parliament and Government being hamstrung by the policies of the UK Government is to give us the financial independence that we require in order to do that.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.463.0/4">Notwithstanding the local variation within the devolved Administrations over the administration of pension funds, to which my right hon.

	<p pid="a.463.2/1">If the hon. Gentleman forgives me, I was using shorthand. I am well aware that there are different schemes for different professions within the public sector, but in a UK context they are broadly similar between Scotland and England.</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/2">Paragraph 5.26 of the Hutton report reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/3">&#8220;There has been scope for some variations in terms to meet local circumstances, but the resulting pension schemes have essentially been the same as those established by the UK Government. That has, for example, helped to prevent pension terms becoming an obstacle to transfers of staff and skills within a sector of the public service. It seems reasonable to continue with this approach.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/4">Paragraph 5.27 reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.463.2/5">&#8220;The key design features should be part of a UK-wide policy framework that extends to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with limited adaptations of other features to meet local circumstances.&#8221;</p>

There is not a separate fund, a pot of money or assets that are invested and then pay out. The current pensions are paid for from current receipts and underwritten more widely by the Government, with the expectation that tomorrow&#8217;s pensions will be paid for largely by tomorrow&#8217;s contributions. With fiscal autonomy or full separation, however, how would all that be disaggregated? It would lead to an enormous muddle over who was liable to pay for what and over who would be liable for the shortfall in future pension payments accrued under the current system? Were we to move down that road, I would wish to train as an actuary, because a lot of them would make a lot of money from disentangling everything. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Indeed, they earn a good amount of money as it is. But they would earn even more.</p>

	<p pid="a.465.2/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I shall try to take less than five minutes, which is predicated on my taking no interventions.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/2">I welcome this afternoon&#8217;s debate, although I am somewhat surprised that the Scottish National party, whose Members have not given a speech yet, has chosen the topic of public pensions, given the very thin ice on which they find themselves with this issue. While 300,000 public sector workers and over 70% of the people of Scotland backed last week&#8217;s day of action, the SNP sided with the Tories and Lib Dems, and refused fully to support pensions justice. Not for the first time, the SNP&#8217;s warm words do not match up to its actions. Many are now asking: what is the difference between the SNP Administration in Holyrood and the coalition Government here? The SNP implements Tory cuts in public sector pensions, pay, jobs and public projects. Indeed, last week&#8217;s revelations about the submission to the Hutton inquiry from the Scottish Government&#8217;s Scottish Public Pensions Agency showed that the SNP is prepared to suggest even deeper cuts to pensions than those proposed by the Tory-led coalition. Perhaps the SNP Members here today can explain why their party in Scotland is doing the Tories&#8217; dirty work for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.465.2/3">Like, I am sure, those of numerous other Members, many of my constituents have contacted me to condemn the Government&#8217;s actions on public sector pensions. They have already had forced on them a change in the pension calculation from RPI to CPI, which Hutton says represents a 15% cut in pensions benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.466.1/1">What I am not supporting is this coalition Government&#8217;s position on public sector pensions, and I am certainly not supporting the SNP and Scottish Government input into the issue. When they had the opportunity, they went to the Scottish Public Pensions Agency and argued for a position that was even more draconian than that of the Tories and Lib Dems.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/2">Many people face plans to increase contributions by an average of 3.2%, but, as we heard from several hon. Members, not a penny of the money raised will go into pension schemes. The constituents who contacted me are hard-working, public sector employees carrying out vital jobs. They have kept our public services going and have already made a major contribution to tackling the deficit. They have endured a pay freeze for two years and face an increase of only 1% when the freeze ends&#8212;in effect, another pay cut. They are not only angry about the Government&#8217;s proposals to make them pay more and work longer for less pension but are incensed at the insensitive and misleading way in which Ministers have dealt with this issue. Above all, they are fed up with hearing about &#8220;gold-plated public service pensions&#8221; and other misinformation about this complex issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/3">The Hutton report clearly rejected the idea that public pensions are &#8220;gold-plated&#8221;. Figures from the National Association of Pension Funds show that the median salary-linked public sector pension currently paid out is worth &#163;5,600 a year, compared with &#163;5,860 in the private sector. Of course, there are many medium and low-paid workers in the private sector who have little or no pension provision, which is a serious problem, but that is not a reason for public service pensions to be attacked by this Government. The artificial divide that the Government have sought to foster, pitting public against private, is failing those at the heart of the debate&#8212;the millions of people who need a good pension on which to retire.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.1/4">To conclude, it is time for the Government to come clean on this issue and drop the myths and misinformation about public service pensions that they have been peddling for months. Public service pensions were reformed by the previous Government and are both affordable and sustainable. The Pensions Policy Institute has estimated that existing pensions reforms have reduced the immediate cost of benefits by 12.5% and should result in savings of around &#163;13 billion on the NHS, teachers&#8217; and civil service schemes, spread over a 50-year period. The question now is whether the Government choose to negotiate a fair and reasonable deal or continue with their ideological drive to undermine public services, demoralise public service workers and destroy their pensions.</p>

	<p pid="a.466.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40374" name="Graeme Morrice">the hon. Member for Livingston (Graeme Morrice)</phrase>, as it takes a special kind of brass neck to attack the SNP</p>
	<p pid="a.466.2/2">attitude to strikes when his own party leader condemned the strikes and the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues were quite happy to sit here and debate it on the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.2/3">We in the SNP are committed to public sector pensions that are affordable, sustainable and fair, but we believe the coalition Government are wrong in their policy. It is blatantly unfair to increase public sector workers&#8217; contributions to their pensions schemes at this time and in this way. Frankly, it is nothing more than a naked cash grab to reduce the deficit and it does nothing to address the sustainability of pensions over the longer term. It is especially wrong to impose an additional 3p tax on already hard-pressed households that are facing pay freezes&#8212;it will get worse over the next two years, as the 1% increase announced by the Chancellor last week is highly unlikely to keep pace with the rate of inflation&#8212;significant increases in national insurance contributions, higher VAT , rising inflation and rocketing costs for fuel and energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.2/4">Indeed, it has been calculated that the impact of pay freezes and pay restraint over three years is costing public sector workers 15% of the value of their income, while the change from RPI to CPI, which I am glad my hon. Friends voted against, could worsen benefits by a similar amount. That is a dramatic reduction in living standards both for those working in the public sector and for pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.466.2/5">Throughout this pensions debate, many Government supporters have consistently referred to gold-plated pensions in the public sector and, frankly, given the impression that anyone retiring from the public sector receives a substantial pension. That is utter rubbish: many public sector workers are in low-paid jobs and their pension entitlement is in line with what they earn and pay into the schemes, so the amount they get paid as pensions is correspondingly modest. Most public sector pension payments amount to less than &#163;5,600 a year, and in local government the figure falls to &#163;3,000, while 50% of women pensioners receive less than &#163;4,000 a year, or &#163;80 a week. That is hardly a fortune, especially in comparison with the grotesque amounts paid to the disgraced ex-bankers who caused the economic mess in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="a.467.1/1">But the lower paid are being hit in every other way. They are being hit by higher VAT, the higher fuel price and everything else. Their living standards are falling.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.1/2">Lord Hutton&#8217;s report also firmly rejected the claim that public sector pensions were gold-plated. It seems to me that the answer is not to attack public sector pensions, but to take action to try to help private sector pensioners. Unfortunately, however, previous attempts by Government to persuade people to opt out of state pensions, and the state second pension, into private pensions, and the mis-selling that went on, have undermined confidence in private pensions, especially among those on lower incomes. If the Government really want to do something</p>
	<p pid="a.467.1/3">about pensions, they should think about how they can encourage people in private occupations to save for their pensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.467.1/4">For many years, we have been debating the future of pensions and how to encourage people to save more, but increasing contributions by such a large amount at a time when family budgets are under so much strain may well reduce the number of people who save for the future. There is a real chance that many will feel unable to make the larger contributions and will fall out of pension schemes, which could be a disaster for both the future of the schemes and the public purse. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40150" name="Jonathan Edwards">the Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards)</phrase> cited the results of an FBU survey, which suggested that 27% of people could fall out of their schemes. In his autumn statement, the Chancellor threw petrol on the flames of public sector discontent by casually introducing the idea of regional pay, which, if implemented, would have a serious impact on Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the north of England.</p>

	<p pid="a.468.3/1">Much of the debate has concerned public pensions in Scotland, Madam Deputy Speaker. I mentioned the amendment merely in passing, but I apologise for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.3/2">There are five public sector schemes in Scotland&#8212;for NHS workers, teachers, the police, firefighters and local government&#8212;all of which are subject to constraints. Formal approval is required from the Treasury for legislative changes to the NHS and teachers&#8217; schemes. It controls the purse strings. Scottish Ministers can determine the design of the police and firefighters&#8217; schemes, although to date they have been negotiated on a UK-wide basis, a position supported by the Labour party. Scottish Ministers can decide on the funded local government scheme as long as the scheme regulations comply with primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.468.3/3">The Scottish Government sought to protect public sector workers in Scotland from the measures proposed by the UK Government, but the Chief Secretary to the Treasury made it absolutely clear that he would reduce</p>
	<p pid="a.468.3/4">the Scottish budget if they did so. In a letter to the Finance Secretary, John Swinney, on <phrase class="date" code="2011-09-05">5 September</phrase>, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.468.3/5">&#8220;If you decide not to take forward these changes, the Treasury will need to make corresponding adjustments to your budget. I would have to reduce the Scottish Government&#8217;s budget by &#163;8.4million for every month's delay.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.468.3/6">The Scottish Public Pensions Agency issued a document putting forward options. Its contents were not Scottish Government policy, nor were they SNP policy, and at no time have the SNP and the Scottish Government made such suggestions. The document simply set out options and factual information. It is ludicrous for the two main parties to have a duopoly of despair and to attack the public sector based on the document&#8212;the SNP has done much more for public sector workers in Scotland than either of them has done in this Chamber.</p>

	<p pid="a.469.0/1">It is an honour to follow that rant by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40044" name="Michael Weir">the hon. Member for Angus (Mr Weir)</phrase>. I have great respect for him, and I never thought I would see the day when he would lose it, but there we go.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/2">I had prepared a longer speech than I am able to make under the current time constraint, but I do want to make a few points. Thinking of the two Government parties reminds me that this is Christmas time, and as Scrooge is one of my favourite characters I am waiting for one of them to come up with a few statements such as that we should &#8220;reduce the surplus population&#8221; or, &#8220;Are there no workhouses?&#8221; That seems to be their policy on pensions and pensioners.</p>

	<p pid="a.469.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for the extra minute his intervention gives me.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/2">I found it surprising that the nationalist parties wished to hold a debate on this issue as I could not remember their raising it in the past. In fact, so bad was my memory that I contacted the Commons Library to find out when a nationalist Member had last raised the issue. This was the response:</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/3">&#8220;Thank you for your enquiry which was passed to me by the Library&#8217;s Business and Transport Section. You asked for statements in the House by Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru MPs on public sector pensions. Unfortunately, there were barely any mentions of public sector pensions so I have included references to pensions in general in case they are useful.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/4">The House of Commons Library staff could find only four examples of the SNP raising this subject, and those examples were far from &#8220;useful&#8221;. I felt relieved that I did not give the Library staff too much work to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/5">The Library searched back to 2006 and found that the hon. Members for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil) and for Moray (Angus Robertson) have not made any references to pensions in the Chamber during that time. When the Library staff asked if I wanted them to search back even further, I was worried they would have to call in an archaeologist. The hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel</p>
	<p pid="a.469.2/6">Williams) said in his opening speech that some parties&#8217; Members did not raise this topic; I suggest he looks at his own house first.</p>

	<p pid="a.470.0/1">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s party has had 36 opportunities to raise the issue since the Government made their public pension proposals, so why has it not raised it for debate in the House?</p>

	<p pid="a.470.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving me a further minute, and I will now carry on with my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40035" name="Guto Bebb">The hon. Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb)</phrase> has referred to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> removing, when he was Chancellor, the &#163;5 billion tax break to the insurance industry, which was worth more than &#163;100 million at the time. However, the hon. Gentleman and his colleagues always let slip from their minds the actions of their Iron Lady. I have not seen the recent film on Margaret Thatcher, but I am reliably informed by someone who has that, sadly, it misses out how in 1980 she broke the link with final salaries, thereby hurting 10 million pensioners at the time and millions more since, and that that cost a minimum of &#163;15 billion a year. That puts the &#163;5 billion into perspective. I notice that the hon. Gentleman is no longer in his place; I think he left the Chamber about five seconds after finishing his speech. His train must have been leaving early.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/3">Let me return to the question of why this is an important issue to me and my constituents. I have 13,500 pensioner households in my constituency. We have one of the highest concentrations of pensioners in Europe and the highest amount of single women pensioners in the entire country. About 6,500 claim pension credit in my constituency alone, which is consistently ranked seventh out of all parliamentary constituencies, so hon. Members can see why this subject is so important to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/4">My home town of Glasgow is a fairly youthful city compared with others in Scotland, however it has a considerable and growing elderly population. We face large and severe pockets of pensioner poverty&#8212;my constituency is, sadly, not immune to that. In addition to the 8% of Scottish pensioners who live in absolute poverty, one in 10 over-65s are classed as &#8220;materially deprived&#8221;. When I was elected for my constituency in 2000, four out of five single pensioner households in Scotland lived on an annual income of &#163;15,000 or less. So hon. Members can understand why I feel that we should not be heading for a race to the bottom on pensions. I want good pensions for those in both the private and public sectors.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/5">I recall a debate in 2002 when the Minister for Universities and Science, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40305" name="David Willetts">the right hon. Member for Havant (Mr Willetts)</phrase> complained about the then Labour Government using misleading tactics. He must share my anger at the current Government&#8217;s misleading statistics on public sector pensions, for example, the constant use of enormous figures for overall pensions liability. There is a frequent tactic to cite figures as a proportion of a single year of GDP, ignoring the fact that payments on pensions are spread. To listen to the Government, we would think that these pension schemes are all in a ruinous state, but as of <phrase class="date" code="2010-03-31">31 March 2010</phrase>, local government pensions in Scotland had a total of 226,554 active members making contributions, and 158,511 pensioners</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/6">and dependants in receipt of payments. The local government scheme in Scotland has funds worth more than &#163;20 billion, which is equivalent to a fifth of Scottish GDP. It could pay out all its pensions for the next 20 years without a single penny more in contributions&#8212;there is currently a &#163;300 million surplus.</p>
	<p pid="a.470.1/7">The reason I am standing up to speak today is that we have to stand up for the pensioners of the future. I believe, as I said in my speech in 2002, that all parties should put aside political points of view and stop their point scoring on pensions to make sure that they represent the people who really count. That offer was refused by those now on the Government Benches. I still make that offer, because I still think that we should all sit down to solve the pension problem as a group, not just as individuals.</p>

	<p pid="a.471.2/1">I strongly welcome the chance to debate this topic. I will focus very much on the Government, rather than on what the SNP Administration in Edinburgh are going to do, because the focus has to be on making sure that we have national schemes that ensure that everybody in this country has a decent pension. The negotiations are happening down here, but the historical reality has been that the Scottish schemes have simply led to a mirroring of whatever has been decided in the national discussions. So people in Scotland are looking closely at what the coalition Government are doing. It is very unfortunate if we try to do anything other than maximise the pressure on this Government at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.2/2">When we have debates on this issue, Government Members all too often raise the appalling situation of private sector pensions in this country. We do need to treat that as a priority, because the loss of manufacturing, the rise of low-paid and insecure jobs in the private sector, and the decision by firms to take payment holidays and by employers to fail to invest in private pensions schemes when times are good have led to so many private schemes coming to an end. As we have already heard, however, on average public sector pensions in this country give people only up to about &#163;5,600 a year. The reality is that those people will not be able to live on that kind of income in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.2/3">I believe the debate we need to have is about how to set up schemes in both the private and public sector that ensure we are saving sufficiently both individually and collectively to ensure a decent income in retirement. I am therefore concerned that the Government are moving away from the decision on auto-enrolment, which will happen in May 2015 rather than April 2014. The Government&#8217;s proposals for public sector pensions mean</p>
	<p pid="a.471.2/4">that people will have to pay more with the 3.2% increase, will have to work longer and will get a worse pension at the end of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.2/5">We have heard a lot about teachers from both the Minister and from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40035" name="Guto Bebb">the hon. Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb)</phrase> and teachers are a good example. We hear so much about the deficit but this debate is not about that; it is about the long-term arrangements that must be put in place. The Government&#8217;s proposals are not about the sustainability of the schemes. We must ensure that both employers in the public sector and individuals are putting enough in. The proposals for teachers mean that compared with the current scheme, which costs 20.5% of pay with the employer paying 14.1% and the individual 6.2%, the employer&#8217;s contribution would be reduced to 10.5%. We are seeing that throughout the proposals put on the table by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.471.2/6">The Government are using the economic situation to cut their contribution, as an employer, to public sector pensions while at the same time increasing the contributions of the worker. Many people will opt out of pension schemes if the proposals go ahead. Let us ensure that over the coming weeks we put pressure on the Government so that they seriously consider public sector pensions and make proposals that will lead to pensions that people can live on.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.472.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40375" speakername="Nia Griffith" colnum="472"  time="015:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0003.htm#11120860001773">
	<p pid="a.472.0/1">I want to pay tribute to all those public sector workers who work hard, often in gruelling and unglamorous tasks, day in, day out. Some are very highly qualified and have chosen to work in the public sector, passing up opportunities to work more lucratively in the private sector. Traditionally, the pay-off has been job security and pensions. Those who have perhaps not been so lucky as to get many qualifications are often in thankless tasks for which they get very modest pay&#8212;cleaners, refuse collectors and so on. They receive low wages and meagre pensions. The average public sector pension of &#163;5,600 and the average for local authority workers of &#163;3,000 are far from the gold-plated myth peddled by the Conservative party and its friends in the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/2">Back in 2007-08, there were tough negotiations on public workers&#8217; pension schemes, and I am sure that I was not the only Member who received correspondence, particularly from teachers. The then Labour Government entered into dialogue and negotiation, however, and unions played their part responsibly, accepting the need to make public sector pensions sustainable. Changes were agreed. The deal negotiated with the previous Government in 2007 made costs stable, and the National Audit Office described it in the following way:</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/3">&#8220;The 2007-08 changes are likely to reduce costs to taxpayers of the pension schemes by &#163;67bn over 50 years, with costs stabilising at around 1% of&#8230;GDP or 2% of public expenditure. This&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/4">is &#8220;a significant achievement&#8221;. Before the Government made any changes at all, public sector pensions had both been reformed and made affordable.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/5">I turn now to the division between the private and public sectors, which is a disgraceful way to approach this topic. Frankly, we are all involved in both, whether through family members or people in our communities. John Hannett, the general secretary of the Union of</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/6">Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers&#8212;a union that operates entirely in the private sector&#8212;says that it supports the strikes:</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/7">&#8220;We support our colleagues in the public sector in their fight for fair and decent pensions and to protect the services which our members rely on.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/8">We all know that the real scandal is in private sector pensions. Sometimes we are told that the costs or the recession have meant that nine tenths of final salary pension schemes in the private sector, once the most popular arrangement, are now closed. The fact is, however, that the employers have realised that they can get out of their obligations to society and their employees, leaving the taxpayer to pick up the costs of supporting people in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/9">One of the biggest dangers is that more people will opt out of pension arrangements. There are three main risks associated with that. First, if people earning less than the average are asked to contribute about &#163;80 a month, they will face a terrible choice of either feeding and clothing their children now or paying towards a pension for their retirement. That will leave many short of a pension when they retire.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/10">Secondly, that leaves a huge problem for the state, because of what it will have to pick up. We will be sitting on a ticking time bomb. With private sector pensions going and public sector workers opting out, a huge number of people will be totally reliant on the state in their old age.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/11">Thirdly&#8212;a problem for the present day&#8212;if people are not contributing now, there will soon be a cash crisis in those pension pots, which is something I do not think has been fully addressed. There will be a present-day shortfall in the money available for paying out to the people who have paid in to their pension schemes. Those are very real problems. Imposing a 3% increase on people in this undemocratic and devastating way is completely unacceptable. It needs a total rethink, and the sooner the better.</p>

	<p pid="a.473.0/1">I think that we all agree that there is an economic crisis in the UK, but it was caused neither by excessive public spending nor by the &#8220;gold-plated&#8221; pensions and pay of public sector workers. It was caused by a recession triggered by the banking collapse of 2007. Employees in the public sector have been subject to pay freezes and continuous efficiency savings, and time and again they have risen to the challenge and accepted that they need to play their part in these difficult times. They now find the future quality of their retirement at stake and their much-prized pensions, which are possibly one of the main attractions of a public sector career, will be greatly reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/2">The Government tell us that the average public sector worker will be better off following the change to their pension, but what they quote as average earnings is not what Opposition Members regard as average earnings. Many public sector workers in my constituency of Inverclyde earn nowhere near the average the Government quote and will not be better off with this change in their pension. The Government tell us that we must follow</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/3">the lead taken on pensions by the private sector, but I believe that that would be a race to the bottom on pension provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.473.0/4">The private sector visited it pensions long before the world-wide finical crisis hit. It took contribution holidays and savagely stripped employees of decent pensions while excluding new employees from joining final salary schemes. Indeed, I recall my predecessor, the late David Cairns, some time ago naming and shaming a major private sector employer in my constituency over its unacceptable cuts to its pension scheme.</p>

	<p pid="a.474.0/1">We have just discovered that Labour Members are down to a one-line Whip, which means they will not vote on the motion.

	<p pid="a.474.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman and will now carry on.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/2">We want to see not an equality of misery in pensions, but fairness. Public sector pensions are not gold-plated, but I accept that they require collaborative review. Instead, public sector workers are being told that they must work longer, pay more and expect less. Trade union leaders who called the strike action on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-30">30 November</phrase> were branded as militants by Government Ministers, and the Prime Minister described the day of action as a &#8220;damp squib&#8221;&#8212;hardly diplomacy, if they are indeed engaged in negotiations.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.1/3">We again see the Government promote policies that are hurting but not working, and their plan to guide us out of these difficult times is clearly failing. For Scotland, this is a double whammy, with the SNP Government in Scotland in many ways excelling this Government in the failure league. We need to accept, as the Hutton report did, that public sector pensions are not gold-plated and that many public sector workers, especially women, will retire on an annual salary pension of around &#163;5,600 a year.</p>

	<p pid="a.474.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that many Labour Members are aghast at the SNP&#8217;s duplicity?

	<p pid="a.474.4/1">I just want to make a couple of brief statements, and I apologise for not being present during the opening speeches, but I was actually speaking at a conference on vulnerable workers.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.4/2">I just ask the Government to let the negotiators negotiate. When the civil service unions attended the scheme&#8217;s talks this week, they were told what they can and cannot discuss. They cannot discuss pension age, despite the previous assurances that Ministers have</p>
	<p pid="a.474.4/3">given them. All schemes have to relate to the state pension age, so, even though some schemes may be able to afford a pension age of 65 years old, the Government are refusing to allow them even to negotiate it. The unions are also told that indexation is off the agenda, and that the index has to be CPI, not earnings, as Hutton recommended, or RPI, as currently.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.4/4">The schemes have to be career-average. The civil service unions are not allowed to discuss contributions, which have to increase by 3.2% so that the average contribution is 5.6%. Costs always have to be within the scheme&#8217;s limit, but in addition the only transitional protection that they can discuss is 10 years for those aged 50, plus the three to four years of tapering for those just below that age. Even if the unions find savings, they cannot use them in another way for further protection. They cannot discuss Treasury assumptions about the discount rate, actuarial reductions for early retirement or any normal pension scheme issues. They are told also that they cannot discuss the abatement rules, which enable staff to take their accrued pension and work on. They can discuss the accrual rate, but that is all pre-determined by the other elements not being open for negotiation.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.4/5">So, what the civil service unions are allowed to discuss in the negotiations is nothing of substance, and in reality we face further industrial action because the Government will not allow negotiations to take place. The Government take an intimidatory attitude by putting things on the agenda and, if they do not get their way, then taking them off.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.4/6">I echo what other Members have said about the contempt with which negotiators have been treated. I watched the discussion between the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40322" name="Francis Maude">the right hon. Member for Horsham (Mr Maude)</phrase> and Mark Serwotka, the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union, when the Minister accused him of not being at meetings. I now discover that Mark Serwotka was at every meeting that the Minister was at&#8212;matched on every occasion. If the Government are not deliberately provoking this dispute, they are walking into further industrial action because of their refusal to allow negotiations to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.4/7">I have toured around, talking to individual unions, and I have spoken to several union executives this week, but the depth of anger does not come from general secretaries or from executives; it comes from rank-and-file trade unionists, most of whom have never taken industrial action in their lives but all of whom are dedicated to the public service that they seek to provide.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.4/8">So I just appeal to the Government: start negotiating properly; allow proper discussions to take place; seek to avoid industrial action; stop the abuse&#8212;the &#8220;damp squib&#8221; provocations that the Prime Minister has made; and start telling the truth about what people are going to get, because they are going to work longer, get less and pay more. If we look at the calculations that have been made using the Government&#8217;s own calculator, we find that no one will get more unless they work for many more years, and teachers and others do not want to work until they are 68 years old just to get some form of pension income that they can live off.</p>
	<p pid="a.474.4/9">I urge the Government to get back to the negotiating table and to take their restrictions off the negotiations. They are dealing with people who are dedicated to</p>
	<p pid="a.474.4/10">public service, who are willing to settle and who do not want to seek further industrial action. I warn the Government that if they do not negotiate properly there will inevitably be more disruption and more industrial action&#8212;and that the Government will be to blame for it.</p>

	<p pid="a.476.0/1">I do not intend to repeat the statements about the importance of public sector pensions that have been made so eloquently by many of my colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/2">I am surprised that SNP Members, who among others have called this debate, have apparently not wanted to speak in it, because only one has done so. However, some of the comments they have made by way of interventions need to be addressed. It is not true to say that Labour Members have not raised the subject of public sector pensions in this House. Perhaps SNP Members were not here on <phrase class="date" code="2011-11-30">30 November</phrase> to hear what the Leader of the Opposition said at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions and were not here during the Opposition day debate that followed, when several Members from my party made very strong speeches in support of public sector workers and on the pensions issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/3">Moreover, in this week&#8217;s Opposition day debate on the economy, only one SNP Member was present, for a short time&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40413" name="Angus MacNeil">the hon. Member for the Western Isles (Mr MacNeil)</phrase>. I will not attempt to pronounce the Gaelic name for his constituency because, as a lowland Scot, Gaelic is not native to me, and I am not going to pretend that it is. That was the extent of their interest in debating the economy and the issues that are so important in underpinning this debate on pensions, because unless we get the economy right, we will be in some difficulty. Today, several SNP Members left the Chamber early, presumably to put out their press releases to say how they had raised this important issue, but in reality they have not.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.0/4">In the motion, SNP Members condemn the coalition Government for not being prepared to give them the money directly so as to be able to relieve some, but by no means all, public sector workers in Scotland of the contribution increase. They cannot have their cake and eat it within the system. They cannot have the Barnett consequentials when they like them and decide that they do not want them when they do not like them. Yes, it would be different if they achieved independence, although at that point we would have to ask, &#8220;How are you going to afford all the things that you say you are going to afford?&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.476.2/1">I suspect that in the fantasy world of the debate on independence, as it tends to be, SNP Members would indeed say that that is the answer, but they have to know how they would fund that and about issues to do with tax and making people as well off as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/2">During the SNP Member&#8217;s brief appearance in Tuesday&#8217;s debate on the economy, he kept talking about the Scandinavian economies. Of course, in the Scandinavian economies there is a very different view of taxation. It is</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/3">disingenuous of the SNP to want to pose as a low-tax party and tell people that they can have wonderful public services and, at the same time, council tax freezes&#8212;which, by the way, are very regressive because they most benefit the people who are best off. The SNP has to decide where it wants to be. It deliberately put such a sentiment in the motion because it wants to be able to say that Labour Members will not support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.476.2/4">We are in support of public sector workers. We do not think that what the Government are doing is right. We feel, very strongly, that we have to stop what this Government are doing, which is constantly to pit one group of workers against others. They are setting public against private, setting people in work against people who are out of work, and stirring up what I heard described on two occasions on Radio 4 at the weekend as an atmosphere of anger and bitterness. In the discussions on phone-in programmes about what is happening, all the clips were of people shouting at each other, saying, &#8220;Why should I, as a private sector worker, pay for your pension?&#8221; No commentator said, &#8220;Where is that anger being generated from?&#8221;, but it is being deliberately stirred up by this Government&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.477.1/1">This has been a wide-ranging debate and I think that there is agreement across the House that pension provision in the long term needs to be affordable, sustainable and fair, not just for public sector workers but for all old-age pensioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/2">Although we agree on those long-term objectives, the central contention of the debate has been that the short-term measures to reduce the deficit will hit public sector workers but be of no benefit to them. The issue at the heart of the debate is that the proposed 3.2% increase to public sector pension contributions is a straightforward cash grab by the Treasury on public sector workers. It has nothing to do with building long-term sustainability into our pensions system, but is unequivocally a short-term measure to cut the deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/3">Several hon. Members have pointed out that this is not fair and not affordable for a public sector work force who are already feeling the full effects of austerity measures that have gone too far, too fast. Most public sector workers are facing a two-year pay freeze, a 1% pay rise in 2013, increases in VAT and national insurance, and inflation of more than 5%. The cost of their essentials, such as heating, food and fuel, is going through the roof. The pressure on household budgets is intense and is getting worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/4">In that context, increasing pension contributions for short-term gain is just the wrong thing to do. It is being done at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons and in the wrong way. It carries the risk that large numbers of people, especially part-time workers, will drop out of schemes altogether because of the immediate financial pressures that they face.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/5">I think, and most Members on both sides of the House agree, that public sector pensions matter. They matter to the one in five people who are directly affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.477.1/6">They matter to the rest of us who depend on public services and who realise that our public service work force are critical to the delivery of high-quality services. Above all, they matter to all of us who care about the welfare of older people in retirement. All of us want to enjoy a decent level of income. For parts of the country that have a high dependency on the public sector work force, the issue is even more acute.</p>

	<p pid="a.478.0/1">What I do not understand about the hon. Lady&#8217;s logic is that the Scottish National party has said that it wants to have a referendum on independence for Scotland in the next four years. The area on which that would most significantly impact is pensions and pensioners, yet in her contribution and in the contributions of her fellow SNP Members, we have heard nothing about independence or about how pensions would be provided, guaranteed or sustained in an independent Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.478.1/1">I refer the right hon. Gentleman to the Order Paper and the motion that we are debating. It will come as no surprise to anybody in the House that I believe in independence&#8212;I am an SNP Member. However, we are talking about public sector pensions and the Government&#8217;s proposals. It might be a nice distraction for the Government to talk about other issues which are equally relevant to Scotland&#8217;s future.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/2">One of the most disappointing things about this debate has been that the Government have tried to defend their proposals by constantly highlighting the disparity between public and private sector pensions. We owe a debt to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40429" name="Katy Clark">the hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark)</phrase> for pointing out the detrimental state of private sector pensions. When the Government responded to the interim Hutton report, my understanding was that they accepted its conclusion that pensions should not become a race to the bottom. However, speaker after speaker on the Government Benches has resorted to the argument that because private sector pensions are really poor, public sector pensions should be levelled down. That will not in any way address our pensions challenge. It is not sustainable and it is not fair to anyone in the private or public sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/3">We have some of the highest levels of pensioner poverty in Europe. Currently, 30% of pensioner households and a massive 43% of single pensioners, most of whom are women, are in receipt of income-related benefits, whether that is pension credit, housing benefit or council tax benefit. Having large numbers of older people on means-tested benefits is not the way to do things. It is the price that we pay for poor pension provision. It is not an efficient way to support people in retirement.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/4">The other big myth that has been well and truly blown out of the water today is that public sector pensions are gold-plated. Quite simply, they are not. Member after Member has pointed out that most public servants retire on modest incomes. The PCS points out that its average member&#8217;s pension is only &#163;4,200 year. That is &#163;80 a week, which is only &#163;4 above the Government&#8217;s pensioner poverty figure. If such people&#8217;s pensions are reduced or they opt out because of the new conditions and contribution increases, it will simply put the burden back on means-tested benefits to keep people out of abject poverty in their old age.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/5">In local government, in which 67% of the work force are women, the average woman&#8217;s pension is only &#163;2,800 a year. Almost half of local government workers are on pensions of less than &#163;3,000, and even in the NHS, in which salaries are much higher because of the professional qualifications involved, three quarters of members are still on pensions of less than &#163;9,000 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/6">The Government have tried to sell us their proposals on the basis that low and middle-income earners will be protected from contribution increases, and may even be better off as a result. That is one of their key claims. However, because of the switch in indexing from RPI to CPI, all public sector workers will lose out in the longer term, and they will all be working longer. That indexing switch has been mentioned in the debate, and I am sorry that more Members did not vote against it when they had the chance back in February. They have a chance to rectify that now, and I hope that they will support us in the Lobby today.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/7">Perhaps the most misleading aspect of the Government&#8217;s approach to the contributions increases is that they have said there will be protection for low-paid workers. As the Minister admitted earlier, the contributions of part-time workers will be calculated on the basis of full-time equivalent salaries, which will have massive implications for women, who make up the vast majority of part-time workers. About 32% of the women in our work force work part-time so that they can combine employment with unpaid work in the home or looking after others.</p>
	<p pid="a.478.1/8">The Government have said that workers on incomes under &#163;15,000 will not pay increased contributions, and that other low earners on up to &#163;21,000 will pay reduced contributions, but when we look at the small print, we see that those thresholds, calculated on the basis of full-time equivalent salaries rather than their actual take-home pay, will mean that even professional people such as nurses and teachers who work part-time will have their pension contributions increased.</p>

	<p pid="a.479.0/1">But in Scotland, the Scottish Government decide the pension contributions of teachers, health service workers, local government workers, the police and firemen. If the hon.

	<p pid="a.479.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing me to point out two things. The first is the Scottish Government&#8217;s living wage, which has been raised to &#163;7.20. That will significantly protect the household income of low-paid workers. The second and more substantial is the role of the Scottish Government in the matter. There has been a lot of chat around the Chamber about the room for manoeuvre that the Scottish Government do or do not have. Let me make it clear that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury wrote to the Cabinet Secretary in Scotland, John Swinney, pointing out that the Treasury would cut the budget by &#163;8.4 million a month&#8212;that is half a billion pounds over the spending review period&#8212;if the Scottish Government did not impose the pension increases.</p>

Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> for pointing out the approach that the Government have taken in the negotiations with the trade unions. It seems to me that they have used a similar approach with the Scottish Government, whose choice has been limited. They have been dictated to, and there has not been a basis for a sensible, grown-up negotiation.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/3">Another point made in the debate has been about the Scottish Public Pensions Agency. The key point is that it was not recommendations that were put forward but a series of theoretical options. That was part of the process of the Hutton consultation, and it was quite proper for the Scottish Government to set out a range of theoretical positions. I am sorry that that has dominated the debate so much.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.1/4">We all recognise the challenges of pension reform, but we want it to be done in a truly equitable way that does not encourage a race to the bottom. We have to acknowledge the progress that has already been made to put public sector pensions on a more sustainable footing and the mechanisms that already exist, but punishing public sector workers through a short-term tax grab will do absolutely nothing to tackle the inadequate pension provision in the private sector. It is nothing but a tax grab, and it is disappointing that the Government have relied so heavily on the arguments that we have heard today. In tough times, all people realise that they have to take a share of the pain, but public sector workers do not want to carry the can.</p>

	<p pid="a.480.2/1">This has been a lively and at times impassioned debate&#8212;quite understandably, because the issue that we have been discussing is of the most extreme importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.2/2">I should like to put a number of matters squarely on record at the very start of my remarks. First, I wish to make it absolutely clear that Government Members greatly value the services that the public sector performs, both in contributing to the economy of this country and in providing the services that each and every one of us needs. To suggest that we do not is grossly to misrepresent the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.2/3">Secondly, I wish to object most strongly to the expression &#8220;gold-plated pensions&#8221;, which has been bandied about on the Opposition Benches. No one on the Government side of the Chamber is in any way suggesting that public sector workers enjoy gold-plated pensions&#8212;I have not heard that expression voiced by Government Members. Nevertheless, it was clearly a deliberate tactic on the part of Opposition Members to misrepresent the position by suggesting that Government Members regard the public sector as feather-bedded&#8212;we do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.2/4">The fact of the matter, as one hon. Member mentioned some time ago, is that this time bomb has been ticking for a very long time indeed. The previous Government sought to address it but did so only partially. This Government are taking the difficult decisions that will be needed to put public sector pensions on a sustainable footing for the years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.2/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40045" name="Hywel Williams">The hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)</phrase>, who opened the debate, suggested that it was positively Government policy for public sector workers to work longer, pay more and get less in return. The fact is that the Government&#8217;s proposals are aimed at ensuring that this generation and future generations of public sector workers receive pensions that properly reward their efforts after a lifetime&#8217;s work.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.2/6">I echo the congratulations offered on the arrival of Jack and Rosie, the grandchildren of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40154" name="Brian H Donohoe">the hon. Member for Central Ayrshire (Mr Donohoe)</phrase>, but I should point out that they will benefit from the Government&#8217;s proposals. As the hon. Gentleman says, at the age of 70 they will require sustainable pensions, and they will thank this Government for taking the necessary decisions to put pensions on a sustainable footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.2/7">Lord Hutton&#8217;s analysis&#8212;many hon. Members said that they agreed with the general thrust of his report&#8212;shows that there are three drivers for reform, the first and most important of which is longevity. The average 60-year-old in this country will live 10 years longer than the average 60-year-old in the 1970s lived. Over the same period, the annual cost of public service pensions has increased by a third&#8212;it reached &#163;32 billion last year. That simply must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.2/8">The second driver is flexibility, because public sector pension provision no longer reflects how the modern labour force works and lives. The third driver is fairness, which is also important. The current schemes, which are predominantly final salary schemes, mean that lower-paid public sector workers effectively subsidise the pensions of the higher paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.480.2/9">The reforms implemented by the previous Labour Government have not been sufficient to reverse the huge increase in the costs of public sector pension schemes as a consequence of increased longevity. The position is straightforward: either public service pensions are reformed, or our children and grandchildren&#8212;Jack and Rosie&#8212;will bear the cost of a virtually unsustainable financial benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.481.0/1">The OBR fiscal sustainability report, which was published in July, makes it quite clear that public sector pensions are affordable.

	<p pid="a.481.1/1">I refer the hon. Gentleman to the comments of Lord Hutton, who pointed out that his commission felt that there was a rationale for short-term cost savings in recognition of a substantial, unanticipated increase in longevity. In practice, these savings can be realised only by increasing member contributions. To suggest that it is impossible to address this problem in any way other than by increasing contributions is frankly fallacious and deceitful, and the Opposition know that.</p>
	<p pid="a.481.1/2">The hon. Member for Arfon and others asked what negotiations were taking place. It is important to put it on the record that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health has met the NHS unions today, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Cabinet Office is also meeting the civil service unions later today. Negotiations are indeed proceeding apace, and to suggest that they are not&#8212;as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the hon.

Member for Angus (Mr Weir)</phrase> claimed that 27% of workers will leave public sector pension schemes as a result of increased contributions. The Government have set out that those earning less than &#163;15,000 will see no contribution increase whatever, and those earning less than &#163;21,000 will see a maximum increase of 1.5 percentage points by 2014-15.</p>

	<p pid="a.482.0/1">Does the Minister understand that that &#163;15,000 limit is the full-time equivalent salary? If a person works fewer hours and earns only &#163;8,000, but on a salary that full-time would come out as &#163;16,000, they will pay increased contributions?</p>

	<p pid="a.482.1/1">Of course, that is indeed the case, as it was under the proposals that the Labour Government put forward. The fact of the matter is that it will not be the case that 27% will leave pension schemes. In fact, the independent Office&#8212;</p>

We will do our best to ensure that public sector workers will continue to have access to pension schemes that are guaranteed, index-linked and inflation-proofed. In the current economic climate, there are many other workers who would be only too grateful to have a similar benefit. Most public sector workers will see no reduction in the pension that they receive, and some indeed will receive larger pension income on retirement than they would otherwise&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.485.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.485.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That, for the purposes of any Act resulting from the Local Government Ombudsman (Amendment) Bill, it is expedient to authorise the payment out of money provided by Parliament of any increase attributable to the Act in the sums payable under any other Act out of money so provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.2/3">Going back to yesterday&#8217;s debate, I appear to be the &#8220;accredited person&#8221; to move today&#8217;s motion. I see that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> is not in his place today, but this is a private Member&#8217;s Bill moved by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase>, so this is a unique debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.2/4">We are debating the motion because the Government are keen that the Bill in its amended state should move forward. The passing of a money resolution is an important step in that process. The costs to local authorities of implementing the new duties in the Bill&#8212;to give written notification of decisions and to review the decisions&#8212;are seen as a new head of expenditure to be met out of the grants that local authorities already receive from central Government. Similarly, any increase in the administrative costs of the local ombudsman service associated with the Bill will be seen as a new head of expenditure to be met from the grant that the ombudsman receives from central Government to fund the organisation. The motion refers to payments under other Acts being increased as a result of the Bill, because, technically, a new head of expenditure is a notional increase for the purposes of Commons financial procedure, even though it might not, in fact, give rise to an increase in expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.2/5">Against that background, I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch for his work on the Bill. I thank him for working so constructively on the proposed amendments, which mean that I can confirm the Government&#8217;s intention to support it in its amended state. The Bill was last debated on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-18">18 March</phrase>. At that stage, the Government were unable to support it. However, it received its Second Reading and the amendments made since make it acceptable to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.485.2/6">We think that the Bill will perform a valuable function. It is right that if a local authority decides to stop or impose restrictions of the kind referred to, the reasons should be set out in writing. There should also be an appeals mechanism if the decision is a negative one. The fast-tracking procedure is helpful. We think that the costs associated with the Bill are, in fact, negligible.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.485.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40174" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="485"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0003.htm#11120860002059">
	<p pid="a.485.3/1">I do not want to detain the House unduly. We do not wish to vote against the motion, although I should say that the Bill is being proposed at rather an interesting time. Both Houses of Parliament spent an enormous amount of time debating the Localism Bill, to which many amendments were tabled but were rejected by the Government on the grounds that they would impose</p>
	<p pid="a.485.3/2">additional burdens and costs on local authorities. It seems odd, to say the least, to find that the Government support a Bill that will definitely place additional responsibilities and costs on local authorities. I also believe that, in this age of localism, the Government are displaying some extraordinarily centralising tendencies, on which the Minister may or may not wish to comment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.486.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" speakername="Bob Neill" colnum="486"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0003.htm#11120860002060">
	<p pid="a.486.0/1">At risk of prolonging proceedings, may I say that the hon. Lady will understand that the Government can support the Bill because of the amendments, which effectively mean that a local authority will be obliged in stating its reasons to put in writing the product of a process that it must have gone through in any event? We are simply asking authorities to record and set out what they will already be doing as a matter of good governance, so the costs and burdens are rather negligible.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.486.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40174" speakername="Roberta Blackman-Woods" colnum="486"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0003.htm#11120860002061">
	<p pid="a.486.1/1">Well, that remains to be seen. I do not think it is a good idea to legislate on the basis of chance and hope.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.1/2">It is important, however, that the Bill proceeds to be debated properly in Committee. There are an enormous number of health and safety issues, and Opposition Members are concerned to ensure that citizens are adequately protected. We are also concerned to ensure that extra burdens are not placed on local authorities, especially at a time when they are the subject of such stringent cuts from central Government. We think that is a most unfair approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.1/3">We will not oppose the motion. We want the Bill to go into Committee for thorough discussion, but I must make it clear that that does not mean that we support its provisions in any way.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.486.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" speakername="Christopher Chope" colnum="486"  time="016:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0003.htm#11120860002062">
	<p pid="a.486.2/1">I am sorry that this debate is limited to 45 minutes, but I am delighted that the Government have moved this motion and that they support the Bill. The Minister might have confused someone following our proceedings when he said that the amendments made the Bill acceptable to the Government. My hon. Friend is jumping the gun, because the Bill before us is as printed; it has not yet been the subject of any amendments. It will be for the Committee to decide whether the Bill should be amended. In due course, if it goes through Committee and comes back here on Report, it will be for the House to decide whether the Bill is in a form it can accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.2/2">It is unfortunate that there has been such a significant delay between Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2011-03-18">18 March</phrase>&#8212;consideration was not completed on that date, but the Bill received a Second Reading in June&#8212;and the subsequent period, during which we have been waiting for the money resolution. Without a money resolution, a Standing Committee cannot consider a private Member&#8217;s Bill that requires such a resolution or even to get the issue before the Committee of Selection. A Committee to look at the Bill cannot be set up unless the Government deign to introduce a money resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.2/3">It used to be the custom and practice that a money resolution for a private Member&#8217;s Bill that had been given a Second Reading would, as night follows day, be introduced by the Government within a short period</p>
	<p pid="a.486.2/4">thereafter, enabling the House to proceed with the Bill by setting up a Committee for its detailed consideration. What is happening now, however, and has been happening throughout this long first Session of the current Parliament, is that the Government are using their power in relation to money resolutions effectively to curtail the private Member&#8217;s Bill process. There have been times when not a single private Member&#8217;s Bill has been in Committee, because the Government have been using the money resolution procedure as, in effect, a veto.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.2/5">As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am inherently supportive of my hon. Friend the Minister, and I do not want anything I am saying to be interpreted as being particularly critical of the Government. If they are indeed enthusiastic about the Bill, however, it is a pity that it will go into Committee, at best, shortly before the very last private Member&#8217;s day. It seems as though the Government are able to have the best of both worlds. They are able to say that they support the Bill, but by delaying the money resolution&#8212;although I accept that we are discussing it now&#8212;they are delaying its progress and implementation.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.2/6">Today is something of a red letter day. This is my first private Member&#8217;s Bill that has secured a Second Reading, it is the first that will be given a money resolution&#8212;I am anticipating the House&#8217;s decision&#8212;and it will, I hope, be able to go into Committee. I am grateful to all my colleagues who have supported it. I am also encouraged by the fact that the Minister does not think that it will cost anything. He said in his speech that the motion was technical, and would not result in significant additional public expenditure. The whole purpose of the Bill is to reduce the burden of public expenditure and regulation on ordinary members of the public, and I should have been concerned if the resolution had been required in order to increase it significantly. I take the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40174" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods)</phrase> in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.486.2/7">I am delighted that we have at last been given the chance to adopt a money resolution, and I hope that the motion will be carried without the need for a Division. I look forward to working with Members in all parts of the House in due course to establish whether the Bill can be improved in Committee in a way that will satisfy my hon. Friend the Minister, but he must not anticipate matters and assume that it has already been amended, because it certainly has not been.</p>

	<p pid="a.487.0/1">It is rather an unusual experience to hear <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the hon. Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> support a private Member&#8217;s Bill in the Chamber. He generally has another function in life: to prevent new rules and regulation contained in private Members&#8217; Bills from being inflicted on people.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/2">I want to raise two issues. First, discussing a money resolution relating to a Bill giving new powers to a person who does not currently exist is a slightly strange experience. I understand that there is no local government ombudsman at present, which is a matter of concern to me. The other day I received a letter from the permanent secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government, Sir Bob Kerslake&#8212;in response to a letter I sent to the Secretary of State&#8212;which provided the helpful explanation that the process for appointing an</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/3">ombudsman had been halted because the Government were reconsidering the nature and focus of the post in the light of last July&#8217;s public services White Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.0/4">We have all experienced appointment procedures in which the candidate was not deemed suitable, there was disagreement about the candidate, or we reviewed what the candidate should be doing in the light of the appointment process itself. That appears to be the case in this instance, but the difficulty is that the interviews for the post were held in February. The Select Committee on Communities and Local Government was due to hold hearings to ratify the appointment, but it was only in November that the Government decided to terminate the process. That is nine months of dealing completely inadequately with an appointment to an extremely important position.</p>

	<p pid="a.488.0/1">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s criticism of the Government rather mirrors mine of the delay in tabling the money resolution. In the light of his concern and interest, would he be willing to serve on the Public Bill Committee to look at the measure in more detail?</p>

	<p pid="a.488.3/2">I understand your strictures, Mr Deputy Speaker, about the money resolution and not discussing the Bill. However, I return to what the Minister said about not envisaging the measure costing anything to local authorities. There is potential for costs and the spending of extra money precisely because of the way in which the Bill is drafted and how it deals with the extension of powers relating to health and safety. It creates a relationship between the ombudsman and the local authority that is different from the relationship in any other matter that an ombudsman considers. On any other matter, the ombudsman can produce a report that an authority is bound to consider and tell the ombudsman what action it will take, but in this instance there is no requirement for the authority to act in line with the ombudsman&#8217;s recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/3">As drafted, the Bill includes a clear right of redress for the ombudsman against local authorities, including the ability to compel them to pay compensation to event organisers for events that are unreasonably banned or restricted. That is where money comes in. The power that is granted in respect of that issue is different from the power in other issues with which the ombudsman deals. The power to spend the money does not rest with the local authority&#8212;it effectively rests with the ombudsman&#8212;so we are almost giving a blank cheque or an undetermined ability for the ombudsman to decide in any case how much the local authority should pay in compensation, with the cost to local council tax payers determined by an unelected official, rather than elected councillors.</p>
	<p pid="a.488.3/4">That is a fundamental issue of public expenditure that the Bill, as drafted, opens up. The Minister may discuss amendments, but the promoter has said that the Bill has not been amended yet. As drafted, that is precisely what it would do, and I have serious concerns about it. The Minister cannot say that under the Bill as drafted there are no spending commitments, but he can say that there are potential spending commitments, which will be determined by unelected people. The counter-argument might be that, as the measure applies only to events that have been unreasonably banned there is a right for judicial review&#8212;in which case, why do we need the Bill? However, there is the potential for money to be spent.</p>

	<p pid="a.490.2/1">First, I want to make it clear that this debate is not about fighting for a very new and expensive drug. Campaigns about drugs are often brought to the attention of Parliament because a patient is fighting to be allowed to have a new and expensive treatment on the NHS. Some of these new drugs are not just expensive because they are new; because of the complex processes required to make them, they will, in fact, often continue to be expensive to produce. Such situations raise dilemmas for decision makers as to how access to such drugs can be funded.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/2">This debate is about a very different problem: making an existing drug that is modestly priced available for the treatment of a wider range of conditions. Clinical trials are needed to get full approval for the drug under discussion, but I ask the Minister to consider whether there is any possible way in which it could be made more widely available.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/3">Sometimes patients are faced with unacceptable options for treatment and find themselves researching possible new treatments. That is usually a road that leads to disappointment, but occasionally something useful is stumbled upon, such as low dose naltrexone, or LDN. The problem is that it is what is called an &#8220;orphan drug&#8221;, which means its patent has expired, so if someone does research on it, a generic manufacturer can subsequently steal the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/4">I understand that naltrexone is proved safe in its normal mode of use, and now has a clinical history of 11 years of use in the UK with no problems reported and only minor side effects. LDN is also very low cost, and can be used to treat many conditions that are both chronic and often very expensive to treat with more conventional remedies. Sometimes those more conventional remedies have severe side effects, which then have to be treated with more expensive drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/5">The purpose of this debate is to ask how a drug such as LDN could be made available to patients who ask for it. The most desirable route would be via clinical trials leading to marketing authorisation and then official acceptance from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the NHS. A much cheaper and more immediately practical route is to recognise that LDN is a safe choice for patients without many of the risks of drugs currently in use. Doctors could therefore be given official advice not to deny it to patients who want it or wish to acquire it from pharmacists who make it as a &#8220;special&#8221; at a fair price. There could also be a mechanism for protecting doctors and allowing patients choice. At present, doctors are in a difficult position. If they prescribe anything that is not on an official list, they leave themselves open to criticism, as well as to being sued and possibly losing their right to practise.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.2/6">The third route is to get it listed as an over-the-counter drug, such as aspirin or paracetamol. I understand that it is considered safer than paracetamol which is sold over the counter, so this might be a reasonable option that would make prescription very easy.</p>

	<p pid="a.491.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40375" name="Nia Griffith">the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase> on securing this debate. I am sure that, like me, she has a number of constituents who are benefiting from this drug&#8212;I refer particularly to members of the Purbeck and Wareham multiple sclerosis group. It is so frustrating that they cannot get hold of something, through the NHS or in some form that is easily accessible, given that it is definitely making a difference to their lives. I am sure that she would agree that there is a fear that perhaps they will not be able to get it one day. What do they do then?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.491.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40375" speakername="Nia Griffith" colnum="491"  time="016:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0003.htm#11120860002073">
	<p pid="a.491.1/1">The hon. Lady is quite right. These people fear that if they change from one GP to another, or if people are less sympathetic towards this drug&#8212;obviously this is something that people have to be convinced about&#8212;they may well not be able to get hold of it. Unless there is some form of authorisation and some form of making it an official drug that is more widely available, they do run the risk that she describes.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/2">The problem is that many patients feel let down because what they see as perfectly good therapies, which are cheap but out of patent, are being withheld when patients want them. When doctors cannot refute a patient&#8217;s choice, they can still deny it to them, because clearly the issue of their professional conduct is involved. If the NHS recommends another treatment, quite possibly one that costs thousands and has drug company support, it is often difficult to get the research done to prove the validity of a drug such as LDN.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/3">Some 5,000 people in the UK with multiple sclerosis use LDN, and a few thousand more use it for other conditions, such as Crohn&#8217;s disease, cancers, fibromyalgia, autism and so on. Their GPs usually prefer not to sign NHS prescriptions for LDN&#8212;indeed, they may refuse to do so&#8212;but there are instances of GPs then charging patients for private prescriptions, explaining that they are worried that NHS prescribing guidelines would prohibit them from prescribing LDN and so they would end up in serious trouble if they did so. One GP in Glasgow who prescribes a lot of LDN was reported to the General Medical Council for doing so recently. My constituent Andrew Barnett has told me that his GP has said that his lawyers advised against it, so he writes my constituent a private prescription and charges him &#163;8.50 a quarter for doing so. My constituent then also has to pay for the LDN itself, at a cost of &#163;17.50 a month.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/4">Some 100,000 people in the UK have MS, only 12% of whom use drugs offered by the NHS. Some of the drugs available are risky and very expensive, and there are questions about how effective they are. Yet some 5% of MS sufferers choose to use LDN, because they feel that it helps them and does not have the risks of some other treatments. LDN has proved to be safe in trials at very high doses, but it is unpromoted and hard to get. Because there are now people making this choice, there must be a way to get this treatment legitimised on the NHS for patients who ask for it. However, we are told that without substantial trials that is not possible. It is very difficult to find a way to fund any such trials because the drug itself is already licensed and therefore drug companies would not be able to recoup the cost of funding the research by marketing the drug; there would be no money in it for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/5">We live in an age where information, including real scientific papers and trials reports, is easily available. Patients who are really determined to make the most of their lives, despite terrible illnesses, and who have the wherewithal to look into the research do seek out information and solutions. We have been using LDN in the UK for some 11 years. Naltrexone has been trialled at high doses to treat heroin addiction and is known to be safe, so the only real thing missing is the marketing authorisation from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency&#8212;MHRA&#8212;for a formulation of low-dose naltrexone, perhaps in liquid or capsule form. A trial would add proof&#8212;or not&#8212;of its efficacy.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/6">The cost of a trial is probably considerably lower than the cost of a high-tech drug, because the drug itself is so cheap. Estimates suggest that a single trial can be done with some &#163;7 million, but that is just an estimate based on &#163;1,000 per patient a year for the monitoring specialists, plus up to &#163;3,000 a year per patient for LDN. There would be the costs of recruiting 500 to 800 patients and then something to cover the analysis of the results.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/7">There are no systems available, however, for patients to translate their choice of therapy into a legitimate request, even when they vote with their feet in large numbers. Doctors do not see any danger in the choice except that they worry they might be denying people a more effective option, but, as patients have pointed out, if they need what is perceived to be a more effective option, they can take it alongside LDN anyhow.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/8">My constituent Andrew Barnett, who is highly intelligent, scientifically minded and analytical, has made the assessment that LDN seems to have stopped his disease developing further. The constituents of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> have confirmed the same belief. My constituent regrets very much that he did not start using it earlier. If he had done so, perhaps some five years ago, he feels that he would still be working and contributing actively to the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/9">Doctors do have to say no to treatment choices for the sake of the patient, but when they have no reasons to deny an option, as is the case with LDN, that should not happen. We should try to ensure that we enable them to prescribe LDN. Doctors all tell us that without the trial, they do not have the confidence to prescribe, so patients face the potential loss of supply of prescriptions if they change doctor, quite apart from the cost of private prescriptions, which is hurtful for many patients who have been reduced to living on income support by sickness or disability.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/10">So, the substance of the debate is about patient access to therapies that cannot get the trials they need for reasons such as not being patentable or the lack of profit in the therapy, especially when the therapy is known to be safe. LDN seems to be the most prominent, in that there are no sensible arguments to deny it to patients who want it and those patients report great satisfaction with it in most cases. It is frankly a disgrace that such options are denied to informed patients who ask for them on the NHS. It would save the NHS so much money to allow this. LDN can be supplied for as little as &#163;17.50 a month, compared with some other expensive drugs, such as &#163;60,000 for Copaxone, &#163;15,000 for Avonex or &#163;90,000 a year for another drug that was recently in the news.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/11">The question is how we can get the trials and get people interested. Academics often rely on backing from pharmaceutical companies to put together their plans and proposals for a research project. It is very difficult to find academics who want to spend that time and energy if they do not know that they will get the backing. They could put in a lot of work without getting any funding for any proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/12">We must face up to the problem of what systems we have in place to provide licensing for drugs such as LDN. One doctor I have talked to, Dr Lawrence from Swansea, tells me that LDN not only seems to have acceptable uses for people with multiple sclerosis but, he feels, has enormous potential for the treatment of cancer. That would be a very worthwhile investigation, considering that we spend so much on looking for answers and on treating the various cancer diseases. Sanctioning the use of LDN would also allow doctors to collect clinical data that could be used to monitor and help prove the effectiveness of the drug.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/13">Naltrexone is already an approved drug at higher doses and research and clinical trials have already shown its effectiveness at low doses to treat auto-immune diseases. Patients have difficulty in getting their GPs to write prescriptions and have to get the treatment privately, but it would be preferable for patients to work with their GPs so that their GPs can monitor them. GPs have had to seek legal advice to find out whether they should be prescribing it and lawyers have advised against it, putting them in a very difficult position.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/14">Among the supporters of LDN are GPs, neurologists and oncologists who have seen patients&#8217; diseases not get worse and there are cases where such specialists have supported its use for the patient and stated that in a written letter to the GP. Even then, the GP has felt unable to prescribe the drug for fear of being unprofessional.</p>
	<p pid="a.491.1/15">Campaigners have worked with local health boards and PCTs to try to determine what knowledge there is about LDN and whether GP practices have heard of it or are using it. The responses came back negative. What can we do so that LDN is offered in addition to other drugs currently prescribed on the NHS? This is about patient choice. It would be nice to be able to make LDN available to patients on a much wider basis, but it is important that patients are monitored by their GPs when using any medication, so we do not simply want a free-for-all. We want the proper medical trials, proof and backing that is needed to show whether it is an effective drug, which will enable it to be made more widely available, but there is a real difficulty, despite the fact that the orphan drug could be a cheap option for the NHS, in funding the sort of research needed to trial it. I return to my initial request and ask the Minister whether there is any way he can make LDN more widely and easily available to patients.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2011-12-08a.493.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" speakername="Simon Burns" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department of Health"  colnum="493"  time="016:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm111208/debtext/111208-0003.htm#11120860002074">
	<p pid="a.493.0/1">I begin by congratulating <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40375" name="Nia Griffith">the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase> on securing the debate and hope that by the end of my comments, particularly the last section, she will feel that there is a mechanism and a way forward that she will find helpful. Like her, I am</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/2">well aware of the interest in the subject from those who feel that LDN is a suitable treatment for a number of conditions, including multiple sclerosis, HIV and various cancers. I am grateful to her for the opportunity to clarify the Government&#8217;s position.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/3">I will begin by talking about the process for licensing drugs in general. An unlicensed medicine is not necessarily illegal in the way an unlicensed driver is; it just means that the regulator has not yet been given the evidence it requires to support a routine place in the market. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is responsible for the regulation of medicines used in the UK, which includes authorising applications for clinical trials and granting licences for medicines. MHRA gives licences for medicines only after evidence has been submitted to demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the product for the conditions it is intended to treat. That system, whereby licences follow evidence, protects patients and means that there is always a robust, systematic and independent assessment of the safety and suitability of licensed medicines.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/4">In the UK, naltrexone is currently only fully licensed in 50 mg tablet form. That dosage is used to help patients remain free from dependence on heroin, methadone and similar opiates and to help those who are dependent on alcohol, but the drug is not currently licensed at any dose for the treatment of the other conditions that the hon. Lady rightly mentioned, because the evidence necessary for a licence does not currently exist. However, naltrexone is being prescribed by some doctors in doses of up to 7 mg on an individual patient basis. This is referred to as low-dose naltrexone.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/5">The reason MHRA has not looked into licensing LDN is that it has not received any application or evidence to support it, which means LDN is currently unlicensed. That does not mean that it is necessarily unsafe; it is just that a licence for its use in this country does not exist. The current position is that when a patient needs a medicine an appropriate licensed product should be used. If it is not available, doctors can prescribe a different licensed medicine if they think that it will do the job. If neither of those options is available, an unlicensed medicine may be considered. LDN currently falls into that last bracket. As it involves a significantly lower dose than the licensed form of naltrexone, and as it is untested, it is regarded as an unlicensed medicine.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/6">Legislation supports clinicians when they want to prescribe an unlicensed medicine that they think is necessary to meet a patient&#8217;s particular needs. The MHRA checks that the medicine is being manufactured to the right standards, in a safe environment and with suitable materials. Any unlicensed product manufactured in the UK must be manufactured to the specification of the doctor, nurse, dentist or whichever professional prescribed it in the first place. The important point is that the use of an unlicensed medicine is the direct personal responsibility of the professional who prescribed it. They are aware that it is unlicensed, and they prescribe it with that knowledge. The position is reflected in professional guidance, including that of the General Medical Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/7">Given that a licensed LDN product is not available in the UK, it can be supplied only as an unlicensed product either manufactured in the UK or imported from somewhere else. Most of the LDN used in this country is manufactured in the UK, but anyone who wants to</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/8">import it must be authorised by the MHRA. In the UK, manufacturers produce a number of formulations, including LDN capsules, at strengths ranging from 1 mg to 6.5 mg, and these are produced under a &#8220;specials&#8221; licence.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/9">The importation of any medicinal product not licensed in the UK must be in compliance with the Medicines for Human Use (Manufacturing, Wholesale Dealing and Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2005, which provides for the import of products when a special clinical need exists for individual patients and when the regulatory authority has not objected to the import. Objections may be made on grounds of known safety or quality issues, or if an equivalent UK licensed product is available. In the case of LDN, there is no ban on the import of products of acceptable quality and safety, and I hope that those comments go some way to reassuring the hon. Lady on her point about the fears of some GPs who had been or were not prescribing the drug.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/10">When medicines are unlicensed, such as LDN, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence does not generally assess them, so it has not issued any guidance on the use of LDN in the NHS. When NICE guidance on a particular drug for a particular condition does not exist, it is for local primary care trusts in England to make funding decisions based on their own assessment of the available evidence. On behalf of their patients, doctors can, through an individual funding request, request treatments that are not usually funded, if they feel that there are exceptional clinical circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/11">In this situation, a special panel that includes clinicians would carefully consider individual cases. They would use the latest available evidence and make a decision on the basis of a patient&#8217;s individual circumstances, but we recognise that there is demand from the NHS and from patients for better access to information about drug treatments, particularly when no licensed product is available, so we are keen to explore whether more can be done to support clinicians, NHS commissioners and patients in their own decision-making by giving them easier access to the best available information. That is why the Department of Health asked NICE to provide a service to support the NHS in deciding whether an unlicensed drug can be used to address an unmet need. Under our plans, NICE will commission expert assessments of the evidence that supports&#8212;or does not support&#8212;the use of unlicensed medicines, including in rarer conditions. That will help clinicians make decisions about effective treatments and address one of the access problems that patients face. As I said earlier, it is important that we preserve the integrity of the medicines licensing scheme, which is so vital to protecting patients. Any information provided will be designed to inform doctors&#8217; decision making and patients&#8217; choices, not to provide a simple yes or no recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/12">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency is responsible for the enforcement of the advertising regulations&#8212;another important area with regard to this subject. There are also self-regulatory controls operated by the industry body&#8212;the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority&#8212;and general controls on advertising operated by the Advertising Standards Authority. Regulations state that</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/13">&#8220;no person shall issue an advertisement relating to a relevant medicinal product which is a medicinal product in respect of which no marketing authorisation or traditional herbal registration is in force&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/14">The regulations apply to any person and are not specific to the pharmaceutical industry. This prohibition does not prevent independent patient charities from providing balanced and factual information about treatment options, including any that are not licensed. The MHRA has published guidance on its website. The MHRA would investigate any complaint about a breach of the legislation, but has not received any complaint about the advertising of low-dose naltrexone. Whether a charity or another third party was promoting a medicine or providing non-promotional information would be decided on the facts of any specific case.</p>
	<p pid="a.493.0/15">The hon. Lady will no doubt appreciate that it is in everyone&#8217;s interest to see a booming medical research industry in the UK that is successful, is meeting its requirements, and is pushing forward our development and use of advanced medicines to help to bring relief to those suffering acute illnesses or long-term conditions and to help them to manage those conditions better.</p>

	<p pid="a.496.0/1">The Minister is being very clear in his exposition. The question that my constituents continually ask is why the NHS is not in the least bit interested in a treatment that is so cheap, costing about 50p a day, and appears to defer care costs into the bargain. A constituent of mine has been with their consultant to see the prescribing committee of the local PCT, but we still do not have this drug on NHS prescription.</p>

	<p pid="a.496.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that point on behalf of her constituents. The short answer is that it is simply because there have been no clinical trials to assess the drug in its low-dosage levels, and so the conditions of the NHS, under the ways in which we operate in the provision of drugs for patients, have not been fulfilled at this stage. If she will wait for a minute or two, I will get to the nub of the point made by the hon. Member for Llanelli about how we could move forward to seek to address that situation. I hope that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40395" name="Annette Brooke">the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke)</phrase> will find the way forward helpful and positive.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/2">The hon. Member for Llanelli will no doubt appreciate that it is in everyone&#8217;s interest to see a booming medical research industry in the UK, because that leads to real improvements in the lives of patients, their families and carers, and we are determined to support it. We demonstrated our commitment to health research by increasing spending in real terms up until 2015. In August, my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Health announced a record &#163;800 million, five-year investment in a series of biomedical research centres and units, which will translate fundamental biomedical research into clinical research that benefits patients and the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/3">The coalition Government are committed to the promotion and conduct of research as a core function of the health service. The Health and Social Care Bill, which is now passing through another place, will turn this into reality by placing appropriate powers and duties on my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health, NHS organisations, Monitor, and local authorities. We will make sure that the systems and processes for commissioning by the NHS Commissioning Board and by clinical commissioning groups promote, support and fund clinical research. The Government will consult on amending the NHS constitution in order</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/4">to support patients to have access to novel treatments and to be part of the development of wider patient benefits, so that there is a default assumption, with an ability to opt out; that data collected as part of NHS care can be used for approved research, with appropriate protection for patient confidentiality; and that patients are content to be approached about research studies for which they may be eligible to enable them to decide whether they want a discussion about consenting to be involved in a research study.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/5">The clinical practice research datalink will be introduced by the MHRA in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research, building on the NIHR&#8217;s research capability programme. This &#163;60 million investment will offer data services, including providing access to data for researchers, data matching and linkage services, and data validation, to support the clinical trial and observational study work of the life sciences research community.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/6">The NIHR will launch an updated UK clinical trials gateway in spring 2012. That website will enable patients and the public to access information about clinical trials and will be a development of the test site launched in March 2011. To increase the number of patients who can benefit from being involved in trials via the gateway, the NIHR has also developed a free smartphone app, which is available for iPhone users and will shortly be available for Android users. It provides a practical and innovative way for patients to access information about clinical trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/7">I will now turn to the question of clinical trials that the hon. Member for Llanelli raised and that the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole raised, by default, in her intervention. I think that this explanation may provide the hon. Member for Llanelli with the basis for making progress in her quest. Clinical trials are a fundamental part of the drug development process, as she accepts. Trials and health research more generally are funded by a range of groups in the UK, in particular by the NIHR, the Medical Research Council, medical research charities and industry. The NIHR welcomes high-quality funding applications for research into any aspect of human health, including the use of LDN. Such applications are subject to peer review and are judged in open competition, with awards being made on the basis of the scientific quality of the proposals. As she has suggested, a new clinical trial will be required to support a licence for the use of LDN.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/8">The MHRA regulates clinical trials on medicines when they are carried out in the UK. That includes granting approval to conduct a clinical trial and ensuring,</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/9">through inspection, that the highest possible standards are maintained. However, the MHRA does not initiate clinical trials. A clinical trial needs a sponsor. Sponsors have usually come from industry, the NHS or academia. The hon. Lady is seeking Government funding for a clinical trial to prove the efficacy and safety of LDN. I can tell her that funding is available and that university-based researchers can apply for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/10">The efficacy and mechanism evaluation programme is funded by the Medical Research Council and managed by the NIHR. It funds evaluation of the clinical efficacy of treatments. If evidence from such evaluations is promising, larger scale trials can follow. That is one of the purposes for which the NIHR funds the health technology assessment programme. That programme produces evidence on the effectiveness, cost and broader impact of treatments and other types of health care intervention. In the case of LDN, as with all other novel treatments, I cannot prejudge how successful that pathway of research might be, but I can tell the hon. Lady that a pathway does exist, as I have described.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/11">In addition, the hon. Lady expressed concern about whether the systems in place make provision for patients to say what research they would like to happen. I can assure her that patients can make a suggestion for the efficacy and mechanism evaluation programme to consider. Topics prioritised for funding may be advertised, inviting researchers to submit proposals for clinical trials in those topical areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.496.1/12">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising this subject and giving me the opportunity to explain the background to a matter of considerable interest to many people, not least some of her constituents and those of the hon. Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole. I hope the last part of my speech in particular, in which I have explained an existing avenue that they and others interested in LDN may wish to pursue, will be helpful to them.</p>
