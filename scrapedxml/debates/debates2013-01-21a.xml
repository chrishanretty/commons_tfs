	<p pid="a.1.5/2">There are 2,619 academies in England. Over half of state-funded secondary schools are now open as academies or have applied for academy status.

	<p pid="a.1.8/1">As the Secretary of State knows, Trafford borough council has a strong educational record and is giving good support to schools to form academy trusts, including Elmridge and Acre Hall schools in my constituency, about which I have written to him. Does he agree that it is important that every support is given to enable local solutions and local sponsors to come forward in successful authorities such as Trafford, rather than simply opening things up through outside organisations that might have little association with our children&#8217;s educational needs?</p>

	<p pid="a.1.9/1">I absolutely accept the hon. Lady&#8217;s point that Conservative-controlled Trafford is a superb local authority, and we can see the many schools that have flourished under its care over the years. As a strong local authority, not only has it welcomed the growth and expansion of outstanding schools&#8212;such as Urmston grammar, led by Mike Spinks, in her constituency &#8212;but it recognises that schools sometimes have a responsibility beyond their borders to help others to improve. In Northamptonshire we would not have schools improving had it not been for the actions of David Ross and other outside sponsors. Similarly, I know that there are schools in the north-west that wish to extend their wings, not least Altrincham girls grammar in Trafford, helping schools in deprived east Manchester.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.3/1">In her report on vocational education, Professor Alison Wolf recommended the replacement of work-related learning at key stage 4 with high-quality work experience beyond the age of 16. Thanks to that report, funding reforms and the introduction of new 16-to-19 study programmes are supporting those changes, which were announced last July and will take effect from September.</p>

	<p pid="a.3.4/1">Apart from the fact that most of that was fairly waffly, how would the Secretary of State know what is going on in his Department, given that his former children&#8217;s Minister told the Select Committee on Education last week that it was more like a department of Grace Brothers than a Department of State? What will the Secretary of State do, therefore, to ensure that people are being served? The Engineering Employers Federation, the Forum of Private Business and others have all said, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t working. Get your act together.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.3.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman, but as Minister responsible for vocational education I do not know why he is so dismissive of department stores. Retail provides many opportunities for young people to learn the skills that they need to be successful in the world of employment. Last week we had the opportunity to discuss qualifications at 16 and the importance of vocational education. I was delighted then that those on the Opposition Front Bench endorsed every recommendation in the Wolf report, and I am delighted also that we have an opportunity now to carry through those recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.0/1">This morning, the Under-Secretary of State for Skills tweeted his support for the Policy Exchange report on vocational education, but that report and Tim Oates&#8217;s report for Cambridge Assessment were both heavily critical of the Government&#8217;s approach, including of their move away from immersion in the workplace for young people. Will the Secretary of State tell us how many schools have now withdrawn provision for work experience for 14 to 16-year-olds, and whether he wants that provision to be ended completely?</p>

	<p pid="a.4.1/1">It is for each school to decide what is appropriate for its own students, but Alison Wolf&#8217;s report, which was welcomed across the House, clearly underlined the importance of high-quality work experience after the age of 16. That position was supported by the CBI and by the Labour party at the time, and our reforms to the funding of post-16 education now facilitate that provision.</p>

	<p pid="a.4.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. We need better integration of schools and further education colleges, and that is happening as a result of the Wolf report. The barrier that prevented those who are qualified to work in further education colleges from working in schools has been removed, and children over the age of 14 have the opportunity to be taught in FE colleges, which they did not have before. Greater integration of the two sectors is vital if we are to build on the successes of both.</p>

The Department has already published two rounds of adoption scorecards for local authorities as part of a tougher approach to driving up the speed of the adoption process.

	<p pid="a.4.7/1">I thank the Minister for that response. I have been made aware of a case involving a couple seeking to adopt, who have been piloting concurrent care with their local authority. The judge initially ruled that the placement order had to be completed within 26 weeks of the birth of the child, but it now looks unlikely to be completed before 44 weeks, at best.

	<p pid="a.5.0/1">It is disappointing to hear of the experience of my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituents, who are trying to help some of the most vulnerable children in our society. We are keen to promote all ways of improving approaches to concurrent planning, and to fostering for adoption, that are child-focused and that will ensure that children are placed as soon as possible. We are working with Coram to develop practice guidance that is informed by the experience of carers themselves, including&#8212;I hope&#8212;those in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency, in order to improve people&#8217;s and professionals&#8217; understanding of how those placements work. We will also be legislating in the forthcoming children and families Bill to ensure that care cases are completed as soon as possible within the 26-week time limit.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.1/1">Adoption is successful for many children and families, as I can confirm from personal experience, but as the Minister knows, there is a shortage of adoptive parents coming forward.

	<p pid="a.5.2/1">I completely agree with the hon. Gentleman, who has huge experience in this area. We need to ensure that we have the right placement available for the child at the right time. That could involve a variety of potentially permanent placements, but we need to ensure that the child has the opportunity to thrive whatever the placement. We believe that there are more children who could benefit from adoption, but we need to ensure that the whole system is fit for purpose.</p>

	<p pid="a.5.4/1">We know that that is still a problem in the adoption system. For example, it takes over a year longer for a black child to be adopted than a white child. There is also concern that there is still too much emphasis on getting a perfect ethnic match in the adoption system. That is why we will be legislating to ensure that all factors that are relevant to the characteristics of the child are taken into consideration, but that none, including the child&#8217;s ethnicity, should be overriding.</p>

Given that more than 50% of social workers are describing their case loads as unmanageable and 88% say that children&#8217;s lives may be put at risk by the cuts, can the Minister tell me who will be able to spare those children the time, love and attention that they need, keep them in the care system and keep them safe?</p>

We want protection to be in place for every child who needs it, but we must also provide the care that children require once they are in the care system. I want what the hon.

	<p pid="a.10.0/1">I am happy to say that what was an academic education limited to a narrow elite in the 1950s is now being extended to more and more children. I am very sorry that the snobbish attitude that prevails on the Labour Benches<i>&#8212;[Interruption.]</i> It is interesting to see Labour Members uniting behind a view that academic education should be available only to a minority, and it is a unique historic trap into which they are falling by endorsing the idea that English, maths, science and modern foreign languages should somehow be denied to young people. What a pity that the party that once stood up for ragged-trousered philanthropists is now standing up for closed-minded reaction.</p>

	<p pid="a.10.2/1">Yes, and I find it curious that there are those who say, for example, that English literature is not a subject that encourages creativity. The assault on the subjects in the English baccalaureate betrays the most narrow of mindsets, whereby the only things that are creative are those which fall within a particularly narrow spectrum. I think that scientists are creative; I think that those who study physics are capable of creativity; I think that geographers are creative; I think that historians are creative. To have Labour Members attacking those subjects as somehow not being creative and not being appropriate for the 21st century is as revealing as the dog that did not bark in Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s story.</p>

My other aim is to make sure that we use the money in our system much better to ensure that more money goes to the front line and that our hard-working child care workers in nurseries and our child minders receive more of the money coming from parents and the Government.</p>

What assessment has been made of the quality of both statutory and non-statutory safeguarding provisions in academies as a result of the change?</p>

	<p pid="a.16.2/1">There was fragmentation in education in Bristol, with far too many children being educated outside the city and far too many of their parents feeling that they had to be educated privately. At last, educational standards in Bristol are being turned around, not least thanks to the inspirational leadership of academy sponsors and academy leaders such as David Carter of the Cabot Learning Federation. There is no evidence that child safeguarding is taken any less seriously in academies. All the evidence is that academies, in pastoral and in educational terms, outperform other schools.</p>

As I have said, ensuring that more students are taking core subjects means that they will have better career opportunities later in life, and extending the opportunity to study maths and English beyond GCSE level for those who have not got a grade C means that they will get those important points. We have developed the National Careers Service, and the helpline has had 62,000 contacts with 13 to 18-year-olds, giving people these opportunities. We also ask schools to offer face-to-face advice.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-01-21a.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40665" speakername="David Cameron" speakeroffice="The Prime Minister"  colnum="25"  time="015:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0001.htm#13012112000644">
	<p pid="a.25.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to update the House on the despicable terrorist attack in Algeria and the tragic events of the last few days. It is with great sadness that I have to confirm that we now know three British nationals have been killed, and that a further three are believed to be dead, as is a Colombian national who was resident in Britain. I am sure the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the families and friends of all those who have lost loved ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/2">First, let me update the House on developments over the weekend and the steps we have taken to get survivors home, and then I will begin to set out how I believe we will work with our allies to overcome the terrorist scourge in this region. The Algerian Prime Minister told me on Saturday afternoon that the Algerian military had completed its offensive and that the terrorist incident was over. Since then, Algerian forces have undertaken a further operation to clear the site of potential explosives and booby traps. This is still being completed, and it will allow our embassy-led team to access the site.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/3">It is important to put on record the scale of what happened. There is still some uncertainty about the precise facts, but we believe that, in total, there were some 800 employees working at the In Amenas site at the time of the attack, about 135 of whom were foreign nationals. Over 40 were taken hostage, and at least 12 were killed, with at least a further 20 unaccounted for and feared dead. The Algerian Prime Minister has said today that he believes 37 foreign hostages were killed. The number of terrorists was over 30. Most were killed during the incident but a small number are in Algerian custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/4">Our immediate priorities have been the safety of the British nationals involved, the evacuation of the wounded and freed hostages, and the repatriation of those who have tragically been killed. Working closely with BP, and side by side with our US, Japanese and Norwegian partners, a swift international evacuation effort has been completed. The last British flights out on Saturday night brought not only the remaining freed Britons, but also Germans, Americans, New Zealanders, Croats, Romanians and Portuguese.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/5">As of yesterday, all 22 British nationals caught up in the attack, who either escaped or were freed, had been safely returned to Britain, to be debriefed by the police and of course reunited with their families. Now, our most vital work is bringing home those who died. An international team of British, American and Norwegian experts is in close co-operation with the Algerian Ministry of Justice undertaking the task of formally identifying their bodies. We want this process to happen as swiftly as possible, but it will involve some intensive forensic and policing work, and so may take some time.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/6">Throughout the last five days, the British ambassador to Algeria and staff from across the Government and beyond have been working around the clock to support British citizens and their families, and I am sure the House would like to join me in thanking them for their efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/7">We should also recognise all that the Algerians have done to confront this dreadful attack. I am sure the House will understand the challenges that Algeria faced in dealing with over 30 terrorists bent on killing innocent people in a large, extremely remote and dangerous industrial complex. This would have been a most demanding task for security forces anywhere in the world, and we should acknowledge the resolve shown by the Algerians in undertaking it. Above all, the responsibility for these deaths lies squarely with the terrorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/8">Many questions remain about this whole incident, but one thing is clear: this attack underlines the threat that terrorist groups pose to the countries and peoples of that region, and to our citizens, our companies and our interests. Four years ago, the principal threat from Islamist extremism came from the Afghanistan and Pakistan region. A huge amount has been done to address and reduce the scale of that threat. Whereas at one point three quarters of the most serious terrorist plots against the UK had links to that region, today that has reduced to less than half, but at the same time al-Qaeda franchises have grown in Yemen, Somalia and parts of north Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/9">The changing nature of the threat we face was highlighted in our national security strategy in 2010 and shaped the decisions we made. Although there were difficult decisions to make, we increased our investment in our special forces, cyber-security and key intelligence capabilities, while also increasing our investment in fragile and broken states.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/10">In north Africa&#8212;as in Somalia&#8212;terrorist activity has been fuelled by hostage ransoms and wider criminality. To date, the threat it poses has been to these north African states themselves and, of course, as I have said, to western interests in those states, but as it escalates, it is becoming a magnet for jihadists from other countries who share this poisonous ideology. Indeed, there are already reports of non-Algerian nationals involved in this attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/11">More than ever, the evolving threat demands an international response. It must be one that is tough, intelligent, patient and based on strong international partnerships. First, we should be clear that this murderous violence requires a strong security response. We must be realistic and hard-headed about the threats we face. Our role is to support the Governments of the region in their resolve to combat this menace, as many are doing at a high cost. We will therefore work closely with the Algerian Government to learn the lessons of this attack, and to deepen our security co-operation, and we will contribute British intelligence and counter-terrorism assets to an international effort to find and dismantle the network that planned and ordered the brutal assault at In Amenas.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/12">We must work right across the region. In Nigeria, we will continue our close security partnership with the Government there as they confront Islamist-inspired terrorism. In Libya, we will continue to support the new Government on the urgent priority of building new and effective security forces. In Mali, we will work with the Malians themselves, with their neighbours and with our international allies, to prevent a new terrorist haven developing on Europe&#8217;s doorstep.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/13">We support the French intervention that took place at the request of the Malian Government, and we are working to ensure that an African-led military force</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/14">can&#8212;with the appropriate training and support&#8212;help to ensure Mali&#8217;s long-term stability. That support will include the EU training mission that was agreed by EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels last week.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/15">Secondly, our tough security response must be matched by an intelligent political response. Al-Qaeda franchises thrive where there are weak political institutions, political instability and a failure to address long-standing political grievances, so we need a political approach that addresses these issues. We must support effective and accountable government, back people in their search for a job and a voice, and work with the UN and our international partners to solve long-standing political conflicts and grievances.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/16">Thirdly, we must be patient and resolute. Together with our partners in the region, we are in the midst of a generational struggle against an ideology which is an extreme distortion of the Islamic faith, and which holds that mass murder and terror are not only acceptable but necessary. We must tackle this poisonous thinking at home and abroad, and resist the ideologues&#8217; attempt to divide the world into a clash of civilisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/17">The underlying conflicts and grievances that are exploited by terrorists are in many cases long standing and deep, and, of course, the building blocks of democracy&#8212;the rule of law and the independence of the judiciary, the rights of minorities, free media and association, and a proper place in society for the army&#8212;which are a big part of the solution, all take a long time to put in place. But this patient, intelligent but tough approach is the best way to defeat terrorism and to ensure our own security. We must pursue it with an iron resolve.</p>
	<p pid="a.25.1/18">I will use our chairmanship of the G8 this year to make sure this issue of terrorism, and how we respond to it, is right at the top of the agenda, where it belongs. In sum, we must frustrate the terrorists with our security, we must beat them militarily, we must address the poisonous narrative they feed on, we must close down the ungoverned space in which they thrive, and we must deal with the grievances that they use to garner support. This is the work that our generation faces, and we must demonstrate the same resolve and sense of purpose as previous generations did with the challenges that they faced in this House and in this country. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.27.0/1">I join the Prime Minister in expressing my deepest sympathy and condolences to the families who lost loved ones in last week&#8217;s terrorist attack. For them, and for all those involved, the past six days have been an unimaginable nightmare. The whole country has been shocked as the horrific details of this unprovoked and violent act of terror have emerged. This was pre-meditated, cold-blooded murder of the most brutal kind, and behind each lost life is a family of loved ones who are in our thoughts today.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/2">I echo the Prime Minister&#8217;s unequivocal condemnation of those involved in planning and carrying out this attack. It is they who bear full responsibility for the dreadful loss of life, and every effort must now be made to bring them to justice. We on this side of the House will give the Government our full support as they seek</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/3">to achieve that. We will also give them our support as they consider how best to respond to the growing threat that al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other violent extremist groups pose.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/4">In particular, the task is to understand the nature of the new threat, which is more decentralised and fragmented and takes advantage of the ungoverned spaces and security vacuum in parts of north Africa. At the same time, in its response the international community needs to apply the lessons of the past about the combination of diplomacy, politics and security required to help to bring about stability in the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/5">On the attack itself, people will agree with the Prime Minister that the Algerian Government was faced with some extremely difficult judgements about how and when to act. I join him in paying tribute to all our embassy staff for the work that they did. In the light of the attack, can the Prime Minister say more about the work that the British Government are doing with British companies operating in the region? Can he tell us whether, at this early stage, any lessons can be learned about the security of those installations?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/6">Turning to the broader context of what is happening in the region, on Mali we support the Government&#8217;s actions to date. Can the Prime Minister confirm that he does not envisage a combat role for British troops? We agree that the efforts of the French military must be supplemented by the much more rapid deployment of west African forces, as the Prime Minister said in his statement. Can he tell us by what means, and in what time scale, he expects that to be achieved?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/7">After last year&#8217;s coup, the Mali Government face a security and legitimacy crisis. Can the Prime Minister tell us what further steps can be taken by the international community and Governments to use diplomacy and development to stabilise the situation in Mali and, in particular, which international body will co-ordinate that urgent work?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/8">More broadly across the region, countering the emerging threat of terrorism begins with understanding it and talking about it in the right way. The work to deal with that threat will be painstaking: diplomatic and political as much as military; and collaborative and multilateral, not unilateral. Does the Prime Minister agree that we are talking about a number of distinct regional organisations, some using the banner of al-Qaeda and others not, rather than a single, centrally co-ordinated or controlled group? Each of these threats needs to be monitored and countered appropriately. Will he outline what further steps might be taken&#8212;he talked about some in his statement&#8212;to improve the flow of information and intelligence from the region, and whether it needs to be better shared with key allies?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/9">As the Prime Minister said, we know that these threats grow where governance is weak. What longer term roles does he anticipate for the African Union and the Economic Community of West African States in securing greater stability in the region, and how does he believe that the EU will support that effort? On the question of ready access to arms, can the Prime Minister set out how the international community can better prevent the spread of weaponry throughout the region, including weapons left over from the Libyan conflict?</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/10">Finally, does he agree with me that if we are to meet the challenges we face, we need a much greater focus of our diplomatic development and political resources on</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/11">this region? We should remember the events of the Arab spring, which demonstrated the desire of people across north Africa to improve their lives through peaceful means, not through violence and terror. We should support their cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.27.0/12">Today, above all, we mourn the victims of this terrorist attack. We grieve with the families of those who died. We stand united in seeking to bring the perpetrators to justice, and to doing everything we can to protect British citizens working and living around the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.29.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his response. I think there is genuine cross-party agreement, not just on our response to this dreadful event but about the thinking that needs to be done on how to tackle these problems in the future, and I welcome what he has said. He is right to say this was premeditated murder, and he is right to say we need to understand the nature of the threat and learn the lessons of the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/2">Turning to his individual questions, on the British Government&#8217;s work with the companies involved, all the major companies have been contacted across the region. All of them have put in place procedures for heightened security. Crucially, we have asked all of them to update their consular information. When these events happen, one of the first things that needs to be done is to try and be absolutely clear about who is employed, who is contracted, and who is in the country and who is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/3">I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that we are not seeking a combat role in Mali. We believe that we should be supporting the French, who have taken emergency action to stop Mali being overtaken by what is effectively an al-Qaeda-backed group of rebels. Our help for the French will be discussed again at the National Security Council tomorrow. We have lent them two C-17s. We propose to continue with that, and will be looking at other transport and surveillance assets that we can let the French use to help them in what they are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman is right to say that the answer on the security front is to train up African soldiers, and that they should play the lead role. Some African soldiers are already in Mali from west African states, and others will be arriving soon. On who should have the co-ordinating role, ECOWAS has been encouraged to take the lead, and there is also the backing of a UN resolution that was secured before Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman is also correct to say that what we are dealing with are distinct organisations in different countries, some of them more connected to al-Qaeda than others. I think that we need to make sure that we deal with each one individually, while recognising that there are some commonalities. We are trying to break up these problems and deal with them individually, rather than pose one global response to the challenge. As I tried to say in my statement, we need to show patience and intelligence as well as toughness and resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/6">In terms of what the Government need to do to step up our contacts with the region, the point was well made. We have had National Security Council discussions on the Sahel and I have appointed my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40237" name="Stephen O'Brien">the Member for Eddisbury (Mr O'Brien)</phrase> as my envoy to the region. There is obviously a huge amount of French influence on the region and we have been less well</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/7">represented. I do not want us to try to track or double up with other allies on this, but we should be working together, and that is what we are focused on.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/8">In terms of the African Union and ECOWAS, we should be helping to build their capacity for the future. The right hon. Gentleman was also right to raise the point about Libyan weapons. The British Government have stepped up our engagement with Libya at all levels to help with the challenge of security and removing so many weapons from their society. In terms of what he said about stepping up our development, diplomatic and other resources in the region, that is very much something we need to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.29.0/9">Finally, I think that the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about the Arab spring being a long-term benefit for the region, despite the difficulties that the move to democracy can sometimes engender, is correct. I think it is wrong to believe that vicious, dictatorial regimes such as Gaddafi&#8217;s somehow made our world safer; they did not. That is not just in terms of people living in Lockerbie, because we still have the problems of Gaddafi-supplied Semtex in Northern Ireland and all the terrorism that was engendered by his regime.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.0/1">May I pay tribute to the Prime Minister for the sober and realistic way in which he has treated this crisis and for his strategy for the future? I suggest that the strategy needs two essential ingredients. First, we must work with the natural leaders of north Africa and west Africa. Nigeria, which he mentioned, and Algeria not only will be decisive in this crisis, but share a common interest in defeating international terrorism. Secondly, does he agree that we need to work to isolate the jihadi terrorists from the other insurgents in Mali and other countries who have local grievances? That suggests the need for a political strategy, not merely a military one.</p>

	<p pid="a.30.1/1">My right hon. and learned Friend sets out extremely well the twin aims of working with African leaders and isolating the terrorists. If we look at the case of Somalia, which is a badly broken and fractured state that is trying to recover from years of civil war, terrorism and other abuses, we will see that the international community is demonstrating working with African leaders and trying to disengage terrorists from other organisations. That is the way forward to try patiently to rebuild those countries.</p>

I would like to thank the Foreign Office for the work it has done to assist the families.

I think that it is vital that we do everything we can with those Governments, who have to have the primary responsibility, to keep our people safe.</p>

Can we be satisfied, in this period of financial austerity, that the intelligence services and the armed services will have adequate financial resources to meet the substantial elements that he has wished upon them?</p>

	<p pid="a.31.1/1">My right hon. and learned Friend makes a very good point. Of course, there are always challenges over the level of resources, even in times when money is plentiful&#8212;and it is not plentiful today. I would say, though, that our defence budget, for instance, is stable in cash terms at &#163;33 billion. We have tried as a Government&#8212;perhaps we need to look again and go even further&#8212;to focus on those threats to our security that we face today: an investment in key intelligence capabilities and greater investment in special forces, cyber-security and the things that will have the maximum impact in keeping our people safe. We therefore have to make changes in other parts of our armed services to make possible this vital investment for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.2/1">I welcome the priority the Prime Minister has given this matter and the tone of his statement, especially his focus on the political and not simply the security. To add to the question that has just been put to him, the truth is that our diplomatic capacity in that region has been cut, not simply under his Government but, sadly, under our Government too. Will he look at that capacity? It is not simply about our diplomatic capabilities, but about our related ones. Unless we focus resources on the areas where the threats are&#8212;and that means the Foreign Office&#8217;s budget not being continuously chopped, as it has been in recent years&#8212;we will not be able to deliver.</p>

	<p pid="a.31.3/1">I will look very closely&#8212;it is absolutely right to look closely&#8212;at what diplomatic resources we have in that part of the world. I would simply make two points. One is that the Foreign Office actually got a reasonably generous settlement in terms of public spending and has been opening embassies in parts of the world where there are really important economic priorities for Britain, particularly in south-east Asia. The second point is that when we look at west Africa, we should be very much thinking about how we will work with our partners&#8212;I have already had this conversation with President Hollande and President Obama. We have particularly strong ties with countries such as Nigeria; France has particularly strong ties with countries such as Mali. It does not make sense for us all to double up in the same places but, working together, we need to ensure that our coverage is very good.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.0/1">Al-Qaeda represents both a mindset and a physical capability. Does my right hon. Friend agree that, as well as an uncompromising security response, there is a particular responsibility on the leaders in the Islamic world, both religious and political, to make it very clear that the sort of barbaric acts we saw in Algeria are incompatible with Islam, and that that message needs to be made crystal clear abroad and in the United Kingdom?</p>

	<p pid="a.32.1/1">My right hon. Friend makes a very important point. Just as we have to isolate and defeat this sort of terrorism in a security and military sense, we need to isolate and defeat the poisonous ideology on which it feeds; and that requires, as he says, Muslim leaders and faith leaders&#8212;and, indeed, leaders of Muslim-majority countries&#8212;to condemn it in very strong terms. I have been very struck over the last year that the Prime Minister of Malaysia and the President of Indonesia, along with a number of countries, have made the strongest possible statements about how Islam is completely incompatible with this sort of taking of life, and we need to hear that a lot more in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.2/1">The Prime Minister is right to use this tragedy to make people aware of the growing threat from the region. He is also right to say that the best response is a regional-led response, but do we have the capacity to have a proper input across the range in this area? The Foreign Office&#8217;s headline cuts were a lot bigger once the responsibilities for the BBC had been transferred. We need a diplomatic, political, security and developmental response to this kind of situation if the threat is to be removed, which can only happen over time.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman asks a central question. I would say yes, there is the capacity, for two good reasons. First, I believe we are more effectively co-ordinating what we have. The National Security Council means that we have the Development Secretary, the Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the Defence Secretary, with their budgets, sitting round the table, which makes it more possible to use that money&#8212;including through the conflict pool&#8212;to come to terms with the challenges we face. Secondly, we have taken some difficult decisions on defence, but as a result we have reduced the amount of unfunded commitments and our budget is now, as it were, in balance for the future. We can afford the very important capabilities that include heavy lift&#8212;vital for the sorts of things we are doing with the French&#8212;air-to-air refuelling and those sorts of capacities, which will be so important for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.32.4/1">Does my right hon.

	<p pid="a.32.5/1">My right hon. Friend is entirely right to say that the work we do to address those root causes will be vital not only for those countries but for our long-term security. One of the excellent things that</p>
	<p pid="a.32.5/2">he did as Secretary of State for International Development was to focus more of our money on conflict and on broken states, because it is there that the investment can make the biggest difference. No one would argue that Somalia was somehow a model case, but it seems that the work we are doing with international partners, using our aid budget and working with the new Somali Government, is helping patiently to mend that country in a way that does not involve military intervention by us.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.0/1">Stabilisation and security in the region are set to be supported by a European Union training mission, although that will not be in place in Mali until mid-February.

What contribution will the UK be making to the training mission?</p>

	<p pid="a.33.1/1">The point about an EU training mission is that it would be part of the process of training up the west African troops who want to play a part in stabilising and securing Mali. The total size of the mission would perhaps be around 500 personnel, and if there were a British contribution to it, it would be in the tens, not in the hundreds. It is a training mission, not a combat mission. The lead on this will clearly be taken by the French, who have the greatest interest in rapidly training up west African forces to replace the French forces that are currently in action in Mali.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.3/1">My right hon. Friend makes an important point. If we look at the capabilities that we have that will make the biggest difference in that area, we see that training is clearly one of them, alongside counter-terrorism, ISTAR&#8212;intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance&#8212;and other assets that we have. We also have training assets in this country. We should be using our training academies not only to train our own military but as a way of building relationships with other militaries around the world, as that would help us in circumstances such as those that we face today.</p>

	<p pid="a.33.4/1">Western powers cannot stand aside, particularly when our own nationals are so tragically involved, but does the Prime Minister accept that the defeat of these terrorist and murder gangs in north Africa and elsewhere will largely depend on the attitude of the people involved, and certainly not on military action from outside?

He is right about that, but, as we were discussing earlier, one of the roles that we can play is in recognising that we have to try to split the terrorist groups from the other groups with which they can become affiliated. In the case of Mali, for example, there is a combination of terrorist groups and Tuareg tribes. We should be trying to split up those alliances, rather than reinforcing them through our actions. I do not accept that the right thing to do is in any way to turn our back on the world. Britain is an open, engaged country and our interests are threatened in those countries. The idea that if we did less or did nothing we would somehow be safer is wrong.</p>

If we look at the scale of the threat to the UK directly, we find that what has been happening in Yemen and al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula have posed a great threat to the UK&#8212;greater than from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. We should continue our focus on Yemen, which very much fits what I have said. We help Yemen militarily with counter-terrorism advice and support, we have an aid programme and a big diplomatic programme in Yemen, and we act with other allies to assist Yemen in its fight with the terrorists.

	<p pid="a.36.2/1">I agree that it is very important for the European Union to have a sensible programme of engagement with north African countries, which it has through its partnership. My criticisms of it in the past have been that it has not been exacting enough of those north African countries, and that there has been much aid without sensible strings and political development attached. I think that there is now a more realistic view in the European Union about the sort of progress, democracy and security response that we require throughout north Africa.</p>

	<p pid="a.36.4/1">I think that my right hon. Friend is right on both counts. It is clear from the scale of the attack, and the number of terrorists involved, that it was some time in the planning. However, I would advance the wider argument that my right hon. Friend has advanced. Do we really believe that we&#8212;British people, British companies and British interests&#8212;would somehow be safer if we, and others, stood back from Mali and allowed it to become a country effectively governed by an al-Qaeda franchise? Of course we would not be safer. The whole premise behind such thinking is wrong. Britain is a country that is engaged in the world and open to the world, and we have people living all over the world. We are safer if we act with others to deal with problems as they occur, rather than turning our back on the world and pretending that it is possible to take that approach.</p>

	<p pid="a.40.6/1">May I commend the Prime Minister on his leadership during this crisis and on keeping the House updated? My right hon. Friend mentioned an intelligent mix of assets. I wonder</p>
	<p pid="a.40.6/2">whether the 12,000 Algerians in the United Kingdom and 4,000 Mali nationals might be part of that intelligent approach, by deploying them in a positive way back to their own country in a developmental role and in a role that shows leadership within their country.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point, which is that in drawing up our national security strategy, we should be listening to the settled communities here in the UK that have a huge amount of knowledge and expertise about the countries that may be causing us concern. That is very much the case with the Somali community, and I am sure the points that he makes about the Algerian community are right, too.</p>

Member for Coventry North East (Mr Ainsworth)</phrase>, about our diplomatic and military resources, but will my right hon. Friend draw any lessons from the request by the French to borrow two transport aircraft? They are the third biggest military force in Europe.

	<p pid="a.41.4/1">My hon. and learned Friend makes an important point. My understanding is that the French do not have C-17s. They have a different laydown of forces. I would argue that one of the things that we did in the SDSR, which the previous Government were working on too, was making sure that we had good mobility and strategic lift for our armed forces. They are vital. The C-17s are based in my constituency, at RAF Brize Norton, so perhaps I am biased, but as far as I can see they are workhorses. They are vitally important. We have eight of them, and lending two to the French for this vital task is right. In future, we have the A400M coming in and that is a highly capable plane that will help with the transport and heavy-lift capabilities as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.41.6/1">Yes. The hon. Lady makes an important point. As I tried to say in my statement, there are many long-standing, deep, difficult political conflicts that have to be resolved. Although there is never an excuse</p>
	<p pid="a.41.6/2">for the sort of terrorism that we saw over the weekend, terrorist groups and others exploit these grievances.

	<p pid="a.42.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. I have spoken to the Algerian Prime Minister six times, I think, in the last three days, and the Under-Secretary of State, my hon.

	<p pid="a.42.1/2">The Algerians have huge, long experience of fighting against extremist Islamism and their country had a very painful and difficult civil war. It is a country where we will want to thicken and deepen our diplomatic, political and even military and counter-terrorism contacts.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.2/1">Many of those so tragically caught up in the terrorist attacks in Algeria are engineers, who, as I know from my own engineering career, are often called on to work abroad without appropriate security information, particularly if they work for smaller companies or are contractors. The Prime Minister said that he would be in contact with larger oil companies. May I urge him and the Foreign Secretary to work with the professional bodies concerned, such as my own body, the Institution of Engineering and Technology, to ensure that individuals as well as companies can make informed choices for themselves?</p>

	<p pid="a.42.3/1">The hon. Lady makes an extremely good point, and Foreign Office Ministers were listening carefully. Some 250 to 300 British nationals are working in oil and gas installations in Algeria. I encourage the companies and, in the case of subcontractors, perhaps the individuals as well, to make sure that they contact the consular authorities, so that we know who is in the country and what their roles are. It would help enormously if they did.</p>

	<p pid="a.42.5/1">I am grateful for what my hon. Friend says. Right across Europe, countries are having strategic defence reviews or their equivalents, and we should encourage them to do that. An enormous amount of resource is locked up in European defence budgets that is, frankly, wasted on a lot of capabilities that are not so necessary. While it is always difficult to change</p>

	<p pid="a.43.1/1">I am afraid that it is very difficult to do that. I do not have the final numbers on the number of hostage takers who were captured by the Algerian authorities; obviously, that will be a responsibility for them. I also think that figures and facts will emerge about the different make-up of the hostage takers, who included a number of foreign nationals. We do not yet have information that any are British nationals, but I expect that figures will be released at some stage showing that a number of nationals from other countries were involved in the atrocity.</p>

	<p pid="a.43.4/1">The Prime Minister rightly said that terrorism will be at the top of the agenda at the G8. Given that we are dealing with al-Qaeda affiliates, or franchises, as he puts it, will he give us more detail on the type of co-ordinated action on which he hopes to get agreement at the G8?

	<p pid="a.43.5/1">There were a lot of questions there. The first thing that the G8 can do is make sure that we share a common analysis of the problem. I believe that we do and that this mixture of tough but intelligent response is what is required. There are some specific things we can start to discuss about how countries in the G8&#8212;France, Italy, Canada, America, the British&#8212;can start thinking about how we partner up more with countries, but make sure that we do not fall over each other in doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.43.5/2">What the hon. Gentleman says about Somalia is key. Last year&#8217;s London conference was successful in helping to bring about the political transition that was necessary in Somalia; it also helped in getting the United Nations resolution that was needed and in the building up of Somali security forces. I am committed to making sure</p>

	<p pid="a.44.2/1">It must be right that, in addition to the appropriate security response, there should be a refocusing of international development assistance on failed or failing states in north Africa.

	<p pid="a.44.3/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. We do have one of the largest budgets in the world and I think we use it well, but we are focusing much more on conflict and broken states; a lot more of the money is going in that direction. The G8 traditionally discusses development assistance, but the G20 is starting to do that as well, and of course the G20 includes some of the most populous and richest Islamic states on Earth. We should certainly encourage their work.</p>

	<p pid="a.44.4/1">The Prime Minister referred to the role that could be played by the ECOWAS states&#8212;indeed, some are already taking action&#8212;but he will know that ECOWAS was not originally set up as a military or political alignment, that its resources are limited, and that some of its members are stretched elsewhere in terms of military activity.

	<p pid="a.44.5/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. The key thing is that it is much better if the military and security forces are provided by local states, rather than by others. The French intervened because it was an emergency, but their aim, as I understand it, is to make sure that we train up and encourage west African states to put their military into Mali as a way of providing security. It is in our interest to build the capacity of these countries and, frankly, it is in their interest to make sure that that capacity is there, because if we do not sort out problems such as Mali, the knock-on effect on other west African states will be felt very rapidly. However, the hon. Gentleman is right that we should not overestimate what is available.</p>

As others have said, one of the key concerns and considerations is how to keep them up to date with the news as it is coming in while not getting ahead of what they are being told.

	<p pid="a.45.4/1">All these decisions are difficult, but the key for the future is not necessarily to look at the overall number of regular soldiers, sailors or airmen we have, but to look at the capabilities we have. We should reflect on the decisions taken in the SDSR that made sure that our forces are mobile, properly equipped and accompanied by all the assets they need. If, for example, we decided to maintain the number of soldiers but not to invest in C-17 aircraft, we would not be able to move those soldiers around the world. If we invested simply in the number of soldiers but did not have drones and other intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance&#8212;ISTAR&#8212;equipment, we would not be able to fight modern warfare. Yes, those are difficult decisions, but I have to say that I find it frustrating when people just want to keep what we have and then add to it. To govern is to make difficult choices about priorities, but I am convinced that we made the right choices in the SDSR.</p>

Of course I want to see Algeria work to defend its borders, but, to be frank, if we do not deal with crises such as that in Mali and the existence of ungoverned space in other neighbouring countries, it is very difficult for any country, no matter how good its border and security forces, to maintain secure borders.</p>

I do not accept the view of those who say that we would somehow be better off if authoritarian dictators such as Gaddafi were still in power, not only because of what I said about his personal encouragement of terrorism around the world, but because I think that such regimes encouraged many young people to take up the path of</p>

We were promised that the policy would lead to steady growth and falling unemployment, but it has failed.

At the same time, in April they will give a tax cut to everybody earning more than &#163;150,000 per year. That combination of policies will force up poverty in</p>
	<p pid="a.50.7/4">every part of the country, and it is a disgrace that Ministers are forcing this Committee stage into a single day.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.7/5">This Bill is a bitter blow to large numbers of families&#8212;in work and out of work&#8212;who are on low incomes at the moment and struggling to make ends meet. Three new food banks open every week; last year a quarter of a million people received help from a food bank because they could not afford enough to eat, and this Bill will make matters significantly worse. It means that for three years, low-income families will get below-inflation increases. The number of people visiting a food bank will be higher this year and, because of this Bill, it will be higher still next year and higher again the year after that.</p>
	<p pid="a.50.7/6">As Citizens Advice points out:</p>
	<p pid="a.50.7/7">&#8220;The cumulative impact of capping the uprating of most benefits to no more than 1%&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.50.7/8">for the next three years, will lead to an exponential increase in net losses each year. Child Poverty Action Group stated that</p>
	<p pid="a.50.7/9">&#8220;the poorer you are, the greater your loss.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.52.5/1">No&#8212;I will make progress before I give way again.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/2">The Bill was designed by the Chancellor to promote his party&#8217;s narrow interest. Like a number of the Chancellor&#8217;s efforts of that kind, it has not worked out as he hoped, but let us be clear that the Government have restricted uprating to 1% for the coming year without a Bill and did not need a Bill to restrict uprating for future years. The Chancellor thought he could boost his party&#8217;s standing if he introduced a Bill, so we have one. Coalition Ministers are here to help advance the Chancellor&#8217;s cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/3">In particular, it is ridiculous to announce now&#8212;before we know anything about the future course of inflation&#8212;by how much benefits will be uprated in more than two years&#8217; time, which is well after the general election. The Opposition therefore reject the proposal to restrict the uprating of social security benefits and tax credits to 1%. As I have said, in our view, uprating should be in line with inflation and assessed, as it always has been, at the end of the preceding year.</p>
	<p pid="a.52.5/4">The Secretary of State claimed in his speech on Second Reading that, as part of employment and support allowance, the support group is protected, but it is not. The Secretary of State said that people who are not in the support group will find that they are affected. That is true, but people in the support group will be hit as well. Citizens Advice has worked out that a lone parent with three children who is in the support group will lose &#163;600 in 2015-16 because of the exponential way in which the Bill will grind down the incomes of people who are already hard-up. We will come back to that.</p>

Previously&#8212;reflecting the commitment in the coalition agreement to eradicate child poverty by 2020&#8212;the Government have published the effect of Budgets, spending reviews and autumn statements on child poverty. We know from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that, taking account of everything that the Government announced before the autumn statement, child poverty is set to go up by 400,000 by 2015 and 800,000 by 2020. In this autumn statement, they did not mention child poverty at all. There was no mention in the impact statement, where it should have been. I tabled a question and the Minister told me that he would reply as soon as possible: I am still waiting.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.3/3">Despite the Government&#8217;s best efforts, the answer did slip out in an answer from a different Minister. In that, we read that the three years of uprating will increase child poverty by an additional 200,000 on top of the increase that is already due. That means that we are on track for 1 million more children below the poverty line by 2020. That is a devastating blow and will undo all the progress of the last 15 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.54.3/2">I think the Minister knows that I have been looking back at his speech in the Child Poverty Bill Second Reading debate in July 2009&#8212;fewer than four years ago. It was an autobiographical speech, as he said at the time. He explained that his first job was with the Institute for Fiscal Studies, where he had the task in the 1980s of compiling its poverty statistics. He said that</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/3">&#8220;year after year the level of child poverty would remorselessly grow. A majority of people would do relatively well, enjoying tax cuts, and the people at the top would do exceptionally well, but year after year more and more children would find themselves in poverty.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.54.3/4">He said that he decided to become a politician because he</p>

Exactly as in the 1980s, as he knows better than anybody, the result is certain: child poverty rocketing. With the extra rise as a result of the Bill, if current policies are maintained it will go up by 1 million by 2020&#8212;right back up to the level he was logging at the IFS in the 1980s.</p>

	<p pid="a.55.3/2">Like the Minister in the 1980s, anybody who cares about poverty and who is looking at what is set to happen to the most vulnerable in the next few years, will be appalled. Child poverty will be growing remorselessly once again&#8212;back to the policies of the 1980s and back to their consequences, too.

	<p pid="a.55.3/4">Barnardo&#8217;s has stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/5">&#8220;This policy will punish children the most by trapping them in poverty and impacting on their lives, leading to poor health, poor qualifications and unemployment.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/6">Citizens Advice said:</p>
	<p pid="a.55.3/7">&#8220;It is imperative, particularly whilst increases to earnings from work are restricted, that support for low earners received through the welfare system is not disconnected from inflationary measures to the cost of living.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.55.3/9">&#8220;Groups which are meant to be protected (such as households with somebody with a disability) are more likely to be affected than households without protection.&#8221;</p>

I think that it is important that all of us who represent communities with a lot of deprivation, such as my constituency of Dover and Deal, make sure that the Government, or any Government, have policies that make work pay. About 5 million people in this country could work but do not. We need more of an incentive for people to realise their potential and do well in life. Part of that needs to be an economic incentive. Let me pray in aid the words of the Chancellor of the Exchequer:</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/2">&#8220;We have to acknowledge that over the last five years, those on out-of-work benefits have seen their incomes rise twice as fast as those in work.

As the whole Committee knows, a recovery from a debt crisis is always much tougher, particularly when we also have the eurozone plunging into crisis because of its years of mismanagement. Unless we have sound money and ensure restraint in the public finances and growth in the private sector, we will not be able to turn the corner and get the economy growing and the nation&#8217;s finances in place. The economy is now starting to heal, but part of that involves building in an extra incentive to ensure that work pays&#8212;universal credit is part of that&#8212;and ensuring an extra incentive for those who are out of work and on benefits to go into work. We do that by not continuing with the over-generous benefits or over-uprating of benefits, as compared with what people in work have received, that we have seen in recent years.</p>

	<p pid="a.58.2/1">The hon. Gentleman well knows that this Government have taken many people on low incomes out of tax altogether. That is not something that his party did. Labour froze the personal allowance and, over time, had more people in the tax system relatively speaking. We have taken people out of tax, because we do not see the point in taking money off people in taxes and then handing their own money back to them.

	<p pid="a.59.3/1">I have been quite generous in giving way, so I would like to make a bit of progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/2">Let me turn to the issue of child poverty. We heard a lot of rhetoric on child poverty from the shadow Minister, in addition to the amazing spending commitment that he delivered to the Committee in response to my intervention. Let us look at the child poverty figures, which the Opposition say are a key reason to oppose clause 1. The figures from the last Parliament show that, after housing costs, there were 3.6 million children in poverty in 2004-05. In 2009-10, there were 3.8 million. In other words, it went up 200,000 under the previous Government. The figures for 2010-11, the latest available, went down 200,000 under the present Government. The achievement of the previous Labour Government was therefore to increase child poverty by 200,000&#8212;not a great record, to put it mildly&#8212;while the present Government have been in office at a time when child poverty has been falling.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/3">Let us also consider the fact that there were 700,000 children in severe poverty in 2004-05. By the end of the Labour Government, that figure was the same. After one year of this Government, however, the figure had gone down to 600,000. Before the Opposition start talking about child poverty, they ought to take a closer look at their record in office. We also need to have a closer look at the policy of universal credit, which, according to Government statistics and the Red Book, will take about 350,000 children out of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.3/4">It is important that we look after children and give them the best possible start in life, and this Government are committed to that. The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is certainly committed to that, as am I. I am committed to the Bill, and the measures in clause 1 are really important because we need to do all we can to ensure that people who are not in work achieve their potential, get into work, do really well and achieve great success in their lives.</p>

Those figures were put into the public domain by Paul Lewis on &#8220;Moneybox&#8221; on BBC Radio 4, and I have no reason to disbelieve him. I wonder whether the hon. Gentleman has.

In some parts of the country, there is no work; in others, between a dozen and 20 people&#8212;or even more in some places&#8212;wait for each vacancy. In such places, where people have no real opportunity to get work anywhere near their own locality, there must be decent welfare so that they can sustain themselves, their families and, most important, their children.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.4/4">I was fortunate enough to speak in previous debates on this issue earlier this month, so I shall keep this speech as brief as possible, given that many Members will wish to take part in the debate. I shall try not to repeat the points I have already made. Instead, I shall focus on the impact that the Bill will have on families and, particularly, on children. I also do not want to disregard one important set of people&#8212;namely, those with mental health difficulties. I believe that the impacts of the Bill on those people has been underplayed to a certain extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.59.4/5">I visited Tyneside Mind in Gateshead on Friday and spoke to a range of service users there. It is disturbing to see the increased pressure being put on those vulnerable people, who are in a fragile state of mind, to jump through a whole range of hoops, and to see the impact that the new measures are having on them.</p>

	<p pid="a.60.1/1">I have no doubt that that is the case. It applies to the north-east of England where the capacity of local authorities to help out local communities has been dramatically undermined&#8212;disproportionately, by comparison with other parts of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/2">This Bill provides yet another example of the Government demonising the most vulnerable in our society, making the poorest live in relative poverty. The Government&#8217;s decision to cap uprating on certain benefits and tax credits will, as confirmed only last week by the Minister with responsibility for disabilities, result in around 200,000 more children living in poverty. Let us bear in mind the fact that this is not the only policy forcing those on the lowest incomes into poverty. We need look only at the sprouting of food banks everywhere truly to understand the impact of this Government&#8217;s welfare agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/3">According to the Child Poverty Action Group report entitled &#8220;The Double Lockout: How local income families will be locked out of fair living standards&#8221;, this Bill</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/4">&#8220;is poverty-producing and means that both absolute and relative child poverty will increase&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/5">How exactly? First, delinking the uprating of benefits from increases in the price of commodities such as fuel and food will obviously result in a fall in standards of living for anyone dependent on state assistance. Given that two thirds of the households affected by the Bill have children in them, it is not hard to understand why</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/6">child poverty will increase. Furthermore, given that proportionately poorer households spend more on basics such as fuel, food, water and other households necessities, their rate of inflation is higher when the prices of those basic goods increase faster&#8212;a trend we have seen over recent years.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/7">In the last few months we have seen utility companies hiking up their prices&#8212;the highest change we have seen is about 10.8 or 11%. How on earth are the low paid and those out of work supposed to heat their homes if their benefits are not increased in line with inflation? We are going to see families&#8212;we are already seeing them&#8212;having to make the difficult choice between eating or heating.</p>
	<p pid="a.60.1/8">The Children&#8217;s Society estimates that the following professions are also affected: 300,000 nurses and midwives in the NHS; 150,000 staff in primary and nursery schools; 1.14 million admin workers, secretaries and secretarial assistants; 44,000 electricians and electrical fitters; 510,000 sales assistants and cashiers; and 42,000 armed forces personnel.</p>

	<p pid="a.61.0/1">Does not that list of people in those professions that are going to be badly hit fundamentally undermine the idea that the Bill is really about incentivising lazy people to go and get a job, which will happen only if the incentive system is made a little bit nastier?</p>

	<p pid="a.61.1/1">I think it is the ultimate insult to ordinary people&#8217;s intelligence to say that in order to incentivise those at the top end of the economy we have to pay them more, while incentivising people at the bottom end by paying them less. &#8220;We are all in this together&#8221;&#8212;I don&#8217;t think.</p>
	<p pid="a.61.1/2">By no stretch of the imagination should these hard-working people&#8212;all those I have just listed&#8212;be regarded as shirkers. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation estimates the cost of child poverty to the taxpayer as &#163;25 billion, despite the fact that 57% of children living in poverty have one parent working. Surely increasing the number of children suffering from child poverty, which is what the Bill will do, will take more out of the Treasury&#8217;s coffers in the long term than would be saved from capping the uprating.</p>

	<p pid="a.62.4/1">I could not agree more, and that, of course, has a dramatic impact on people at the lower end of the income spectrum.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.4/2">Let me clarify something that I said a moment ago. The average income per household in my constituency is just above &#163;20,000 per annum, but that average is dragged up by some relatively well-heeled neighbourhoods. An awful lot of my constituents are struggling to get by, and I have a fantastic amount of sympathy for them, but there seems to be a compassion bypass on the Government Benches.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.4/3">Given that most of the people affected by the Bill are in work, perhaps the Minister should adopt my earlier suggestion and return to the idea of a living wage. That could reduce the benefits bill, and also make companies such as Starbucks pay their staff a real wage so that we, the taxpayers, would not have to subsidise multinationals that may not be paying the corporation tax that they should be paying.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.4/4">The Chancellor talks of strivers and skivers, but I see something different on the ground. I see families scraping by in low-paid work, or jumping from insecure jobs to benefits and back again. I have come across people who are working with all their might and main, moving from one part-time job to another just to scrape a living, and all too often the work that they are doing is demeaning and low-paid.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.4/5">The truth, unlike what the Government keep spouting, is that those who rely on benefits and tax credits are in work, have worked, or will be desperately trying to find work in the near future. They are not scroungers, but victims of a stagnated economy, and the Government are undoubtedly making the situation worse. We need to stimulate the economy rather than stagnating it. We need to provide jobs in places such as the north-east. That, rather than crippling those who are on the lowest income levels in the whole economy, is the way to reduce the benefits bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.62.4/6">Let me say this to Members in all parts of the House. When they walk towards the Lobbies, they should think</p>
	<p pid="a.62.4/7">long and hard about whether they can vote to allow 200,000 more children to live in poverty. I know which Lobby I will choose.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.0/1">I think it would be a good idea for us to start by working out what we agree about, because during debates such as this the House sometimes becomes very tribal. It seems to me that we agree that we hate poverty, and that that is true not just of the Opposition but of the two governing parties. We see poverty as a scourge. We come here to promote and support policies that will make people better off and improve their living standards&#8212;of course we do&#8212;and today&#8217;s debate is about how we can achieve that in very straitened and difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.63.0/2">I should have thought it was common ground that we need to ensure that it is more worth while to work. In order to ascertain whether that is common ground, I intervened on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>&#8212;who was very eloquent&#8212;and he said that that was indeed Labour policy as well as Conservative and Liberal Democrat policy. So we agree that we want to get rid of poverty and that we need to make work more worth while. That is where our Ministers are faced with a difficult dilemma. Last year&#8217;s benefits uprating occurred at about the peak of the spike in inflation and so benefit recipients got the 5.2% increase whereas low-paid people working alongside them in their local communities got perhaps 1.7%, if they were lucky&#8212;that was about the average. Suddenly, in one fell swoop, people were 3.5% worse off in work than out of work because of the normal uprating.</p>

	<p pid="a.63.1/1">What the right hon. Gentleman has just said is fundamentally untrue. Just because the percentage rise for someone on &#163;71 a week is more than that for someone on &#163;35,000 a year does not mean that they are better off. Will he correct the record on that point?</p>

	<p pid="a.63.2/1">No, I am talking about people in very similar circumstances&#8212;those either in low-income employment or out of work&#8212;where the two numbers are much closer together. They are closer together than any of us would like, because we want it to be that much more worth while for people to work. The hon. Gentleman has to accept that, at the lowest income levels, there was a problem because the benefits went up by much more than the wages. What would the best answer be? It would be for all wages to go up more. The second best answer would be for the prices not to go up so much. But we are where we are and we have to work to try to come up with a fair settlement for the future.</p>

I do not just want tax cuts for the rich; I want tax cuts for those on middle incomes and low incomes, particularly those at the lower end. The idea of the tax cut for the rich is to get more money out of them; all we are trying to do is get back closer to Labour&#8217;s very successful 40% rate, which it kept for almost all the time it was in office. I noticed that its 40% rate collected considerably more revenue than the 50% it bequeathed to the incoming Government, and so it was rather foolish to put in a rate that did not work in taking money off the rich. We are trying to get back to the earlier rate.</p>

	<p pid="a.64.6/1">The hon. Lady has chosen the wrong Member to accuse of not reading the Budget papers properly; I am normally accused by my right hon. Friends of reading them too closely. If she read on through those Budget papers, she would see that that top rate led to an almost 10% reduction in the amount of top-level income tax coming in, which is a very foolish position to get into when we need all the money we can get. My right hon. and hon. Friends are very sensible to try to correct that, in order to get more money off the rich. We need more money off them and less money off people at the other end of the income scale. The way to take less money off people at the other end of that scale is to take them out of tax altogether, and good progress is being made in that regard.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.1/1">What a miserable world the hon. Lady lives in. People on &#163;30,000 and &#163;40,000 need more money as well as people on &#163;10,000 and &#163;20,000, and I am here to try to ensure that they get more money. I do not believe that the Government should take all their money; they should be allowed to keep more of it so that they have more to spend, which would create more jobs. I thought that was part of the Opposition&#8217;s argument&#8212;or it would be, were we having a different debate. They will not use that argument today, because we are debating benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.1/2">My right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench are trying to deal with part of the problem by taking people out of tax altogether and cutting the amount of tax that those at the lower end of the income scale have to pay. That is a very good thing to be doing. They are also about to launch their universal credit in trial systems. The whole purpose of universal credit, as described, is to make it more worth while to work and to deal with the fact that if benefit is taken away too quickly, people face a high rate of tax combined with benefit withdrawal, which is a big disincentive to going to work. It might even get in the way of their going to work, as they might not have enough money for the bus fare, the clothes they need and all the rest of the things one needs when setting oneself back up in a job. That is very important.</p>

I accept his implied point: in some parts of the country work is very scarce and we need economic policies that promote it. That is where lower taxes can be extremely helpful, and I urge my colleagues on the Front Bench to do more, if they can, because if more money is circulating in people&#8217;s pockets, bank accounts and purses, we will have more spending in the economy, which will help.</p>

	<p pid="a.65.5/1">That is not my case at all. My case is that the Government inherited an impossible financial position: the public sector was spending and borrowing far too much and the economy had been performing very badly, with a collapse in living standards towards the end of Labour&#8217;s period in office that was the biggest that any of us in this House had witnessed in our lifetimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/2">My right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench are trying desperately to come up with a series of policies that promote growth and restore a greater</p>
	<p pid="a.65.5/3">degree of normality. The Committee must recognise that the model that sustained growth from 1945 through to 2007 was comprehensively broken when Labour broke the banks and nationalised them.

	<p pid="a.66.0/1">I know that the right hon. Gentleman always reads his economic documents, so why does he disagree with the view expressed by the Chancellor when he came to office in 2010 and by the IMF now that the automatic stabilisers in our economy should operate unimpeded?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-01-21a.66.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" speakername="John Redwood" colnum="66"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0002.htm#13012124000177">
	<p pid="a.66.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman looks again at the numbers in the Budget Red Book, he will see that the automatic stabilisers have been more than functioning. Under this Government, public spending has gone up considerably while borrowing has remained at extremely high levels. The borrowing levels the Government inherited were off the chart compared with those in any previous cycle we have witnessed in the British economy. Levels of public borrowing are still well above the peaks in previous cycles. The hon. Gentleman must understand that the numbers show that plenty of automatic stabilisers are in operation&#8212;the question he needs to answer is why they are not working. Of course, they are not working because of the other problems that have been inherited, such as the broken banks, the difficulties with tax rates and the large structural deficit. Those are all part of the problem and we can debate them at another time during a general debate on the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/2">The Government are attempting, through their tax and benefit changes, to tackle the problem of people asking, &#8220;Why work?&#8221; I have two bits of advice for my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench that might be more to the liking of the Labour party. If my right hon. and hon. Friends are going to pursue and sustain the policy of very low benefit increases for the next period, it is important that two other conditions are met. The first is that every action should be taken to get inflation down. If inflation suddenly took off, this would become a much tougher and crueller policy than Ministers have in mind. That would be extremely difficult. So it is in everybody&#8217;s interest&#8212;not just of those in low-paid work and not just those on benefit, but those people in particular&#8212;that more is done to sustain and control price rises.</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/3">I hope my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench will make sure that their contacts with the Bank of England stress the need to do a better job of controlling price inflation than the Bank has been able to do in recent years, and I hope they will also be looking at reforms in a number of areas, particularly in energy, for example, because it is energy prices above all which have done so much damage to people at all income levels, but especially to people on low incomes and benefit incomes. There are other things, which are not the main subject of this debate, that could be done to tackle high and rising energy prices. This policy will be much easier to sell and to sustain if Ministers can say, &#8220;The real cut is very small because we are doing a better job now of controlling price inflation than was the case in the past.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.66.1/4">The second condition picks up on a point that has already been mentioned by the Opposition. The policy will also be much easier to sustain if more jobs are flowing into the economy. I pay tribute to those on the Front Bench for what they have achieved so far. Some 1.2 million new jobs have been created in the economy during their period in office. That is extremely welcome. We need to make sure that more people already settled here and down on their luck get access to those jobs and can take them so that they can enjoy the benefits of higher income in work.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.0/1">My right hon. Friend makes a valid point&#8212;1.2 million new jobs created. He missed one point, however&#8212; 1.2 million new private sector jobs.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.1/1">That is true, and it had to be the case because the public sector had no money left, as the previous Chief Secretary reminded us, and it was inevitable that action had to be taken to rein in the public sector. I remember that just before the Labour Government left office, they enacted proposals to halve the deficit over the next Parliament, so members of their Front-Bench team in office were fully aware that they had overdone it and they were recommending pretty unpalatable cuts to their colleagues. They did not specify the cuts, of course, because that would have been even more unpopular, but they told us in general terms that there had to be very big cuts.</p>

	<p pid="a.67.2/1">Is the right hon. Gentleman pleased that many of those 1.2 million jobs claimed to have been created are part-time and low paid, and as such allow people to claim tax credits and lift the bill that his hon. Friends complain so much about?</p>

	<p pid="a.67.3/1">If somebody wanted a part-time job, I am delighted that they have now got a part-time job. Quite a lot of people choose to have a part-time job. Their family commitments mean that that is what they can manage and it is a very good thing that we have generated more part-time jobs so that they can have them. To those who seriously want a full-time job&#8212;I am sure the hon. Gentleman can find people who would prefer a full-time job and are still in part-time work&#8212;I would say it is easier to get that full-time job from their part-time job than from unemployment. It is easier to get work from work. It is easier to get promoted when they are in the company and very difficult to get promoted if they have not joined the company.</p>
	<p pid="a.67.3/2">It is very encouraging that people in some of our best large enterprises start off in part-time, low-paid, not very glamorous work, and when they show application and interest, they get trained and are then given greater responsibilities, and they can go on to do great things. When I last visited one of my local supermarkets, I met the manager and the deputy manager who had worked their way up from shelf-stacking some years before. That is great and shows that that path can work for people.</p>

	<p pid="a.68.0/1">I have already expressed the view that I did not come to Parliament to impose such restrictions on people with very little income, that that is a difficult thing to have to do but that I quite understand why Front Benchers are in that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.0/2">Yes, I will trust Ministers&#8217; judgment today but I am also saying to them that there are those two important conditions. They have to watch the situation because if inflation starts to rise too far, things will be too tough, and it would be wrong not to recognise that. If there is not a sustained increase in the number of jobs, that, too, will make the policy difficult to sustain. I am hoping that the economic policy can kick in with lower price rises and more jobs, which would make the measure a little less unpalatable. However, surely nobody can say that they want to do this&#8212;it is not very pleasant&#8212;but what else can we do?</p>

	<p pid="a.68.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is making an interesting speech. However, is not a clear consequence of his argument that it is a serious mistake to be setting now the levels of benefits in two years&#8217; time, when we just do not know what inflation will be in the meantime?</p>

	<p pid="a.68.2/1">The Government are fighting for credibility with their general finances. They have a series of difficult decisions to make and have decided to make this decision. The Opposition cannot always come here and say that they must get the deficit down but never support anything that makes a contribution towards that. That is where they have great difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/2">The Opposition have great difficulties today because they are coming here and saying that they do not like the measure, but will not support amendments that would mean that we were definitely going to pay a lot more. They have sufficient maturity to understand that the benefits bill is extremely large and difficult to manage.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/3">I have one final thought to put to Ministers. The British public, who wish to see the benefit bill controlled and brought down, are keen for us to check up on eligibility, which causes more issues than anything else. Most of us feel extremely generous when it comes to eligibility for disabled people and we want the Government to do the best they possibly can, which might not be generous enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.68.2/4">What we are worried about is extending eligibility too far&#8212;through the European Union rules, for example. I hope that that kind of thing will be pursued. I hear that the Prime Minister is now looking at the matter, but I do not think it is right that a large number of people should be able to come into the country and immediately start claiming benefits that other people, who have been settled here for a long time and are working hard, have had to pay into and make contributions towards. I hope that we will get better news and that there will be some kind of contributory principle or settlement before people can get those benefits, so that somebody who has been living here clearly becomes our responsibility after a sensible period.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.1/1">I am rather pleased that our benefits system is a lot more generous than those afforded in eastern Europe, but I also want to make sure that we do not open ourselves up to paying a large number of benefit bills to people from more or less anywhere in the European Union who come here because they have worked out that we have a generous system compared with theirs. That would seem extremely unfair, very tough on British taxpayers and ultimately self-defeating, because people who were working hard and had talent and enterprise would say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to pay the tax rates in Britain to pay for benefits for everybody else, so I&#8217;ll go somewhere else to do my work.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.69.2/1">My right hon. Friend made an interesting and important point about eligibility. Does he agree that one of the most pernicious legacies of the last Government was that their tendency to hand out, increase and widen the eligibility for welfare payments has meant that, when the payback comes, the most vulnerable people in our society tend to be hardest hit? We are doing everything we can to target benefits at those who need them most. For example, there are 600,000 disability claimants. Increasingly, we know that small groups of people desperately need the benefits but that many receiving them do not.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.3/1">I quite agree. I would like to see a more generous regime for disabled people, as my hon. Friend rightly says. To pay for that, I have come up with suggestions both on getting more people back into work, which is the best way, and on dealing with the issue of eligibility so that only our own deserving cases get the generous treatment that we rightly expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.3/2">In summary, the policy is not easy. Ministers have to watch to make sure that it does not become unintentionally more penal. We want much more work on the side of promoting jobs and growth because we come here to eliminate poverty, not to make it worse. It is also time for the Opposition to join the serious conversation about how we tackle these obstinate and difficult issues, given that the high-level aims&#8212;getting rid of poverty and making it more worth while to work&#8212;are, mercifully, shared across the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.69.4/1">I will speak to amendment 7, which stands in my name. It is an attempt, at least, to neuter what I believe is a cruel and callous Bill by restoring the historic link between benefits and tax credits and the retail prices index.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.4/2">It is a fiction that benefit levels are too high. Someone who relies on benefits is poor and will be struggling to survive from week to week; if any unexpected costs occur, they will probably have to go without or go into debt. The Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that we do not know at least two important things about the Bill: we do not know what the actual effects of breaking the link with prices will be, because that will depend on future price levels, which exposes the poorest in society to serious inflation risk; and secondly, we do not know the Government&#8217;s view on how benefits should be indexed in the longer run, and we ought to.</p>
	<p pid="a.69.4/3">What are we to make of the Government&#8217;s long-term policy intentions? Unfortunately, I think they are clear: to chip away at the welfare state and leave people to fend for themselves, with US-style deprivation for the unsuccessful. It is a scandal to expose poor people to such risk and insecurity, especially at the same time as the most wealthy are set to enjoy a significant tax cut. That is why I have tabled my amendments, which represent the very minimum safety net that must be in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.70.1/1">I think the answer is probably both of the above. Recently, the RPI has been higher. I would have been happy to look at an amendment&#8212;no such amendment exists, unfortunately&#8212;that combined the work that the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s party has been doing on earnings with my effort to get a link back to the RPI and prices. We should look at whichever is the most generous. I stuck to the RPI link in my amendment because I wanted it to be realistic enough to get more support across the House. I fear that I might have been a little over-ambitious.</p>
	<p pid="a.70.1/2">It worries me that instead of seeking to restore the link to prices, the official Opposition have not sought to protect people who are seeking work, but appear to have picked out one or two benefits, such as employment and support allowance and maternity benefit, for proper protection. They have ignored, for example, those on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance, as long as some sort of workfare system is brought in for people who have been looking for work for two years. Do the Opposition think that it is okay for the link to be broken for JSA recipients in the meantime? The Opposition amendments offer an improvement to a nasty Bill, and for that I support them, but I believe they expose a certain cowardice in not confronting the stereotypes and myths that the Government continue to perpetrate. Why are the Opposition not standing up for unemployed people and restoring the link to RPI? I do not accept that they could not consider that principle today, and it is disappointing that they will not. A link to prices is an absolute minimum, a safety net red line.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.1/1">The proposition is spurious. First, it happens very rarely; secondly, we ought to look at the actual amounts of money involved. The Government talk glibly about percentages, but the percentage of something very small is still very small. The amounts that we are talking about do not make that much difference. What does make a difference is social solidarity and the sense of people really being in it together. If this Government cared more about making that a reality than just having the rhetoric, we might stand a chance of securing a happier and better-off society.</p>

	<p pid="a.71.8/2">The Opposition have supported the public sector pay freeze and the switch from RPI to CPI introduced by the coalition, saying that they did so on a short-term basis to tackle the deficit. The former shadow Pensions Minister, now shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40357" name="Rachel Reeves">the hon.

	<p pid="a.71.8/3">&#8220;Making a permanent change from the use of the retail prices index to the consumer prices index with the impact being felt even after the deficit is long gone is an ideologically driven move that we do not support.&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Pensions Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2011-07-14">14 July 2011</phrase>; c. 293.]</p>

We are in the grip of a harsh public sector pay freeze imposed by the Government and supported by the Opposition. If the Opposition really believe in making sure that benefits reflect the increase in the price of a pint of milk or a pair of school shoes, or what it really costs to make sure that people can survive without becoming destitute, I ask them again to reconsider whether they might support my amendment.</p>

However, we have a public sector pay freeze, and earnings growth right now is slow; people are experiencing falling living standards as energy bills and food prices rise faster than income. In the longer term, however, earnings are important. Since the second world war, the UK norm has been for earnings to rise faster than prices, with real wages rising in most years, driving living standards higher.</p>

	<p pid="a.72.3/1">Let me make a bit more progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.72.3/2">It is worth remembering that benefits were linked to earnings until 1980, when the Thatcher Government changed the link to prices in order to save money. That was a deliberate and aggressive policy to run down benefit levels. In 1980, unemployment benefits were one fifth of average earnings; today, they are one tenth. Earnings are important in the long term, but in the current context, I worry that focusing on earnings when they are so low, without the link to RPI, risks being a smokescreen for existing Government policy. I worry that without the additional protection of a link to prices, the link to earnings will not protect people from inflation risk over the next three years. People must, at the very minimum, be able to keep up with the rising cost of living. My personal view is that benefits should increase either in line with RPI or in line with average earnings, depending on which is higher, but I deliberately tabled a more modest amendment that would just restore the link to RPI because I wanted to press the Committee to provide that minimum protection in the face of this Bill, and hoped that such an amendment would garner more support.</p>

	<p pid="a.73.0/1">If the hon. Gentleman made a distinction between the overall benefits bill and pensions, he might find that he had a rather different set of figures before him.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/2">It is not true that the Government are doing this to be fair. The measure is an unnecessary, spiteful and counter-productive attack on the poor. It is unnecessary because it is ludicrous to blame the unemployed and the low-paid for the deficit and to elicit from them the highest price for paying it off when high earners are receiving tax breaks. As the Government well know but conveniently forget, the culprits behind the entire financial crisis were the bankers on their very high incomes, many of whom do very well from over-generous tax relief on pension contributions and will benefit from the tax cut that is being granted to the highest earners with the abolition of the 50p rate. I welcome the Opposition&#8217;s amendment on the latter point.</p>
	<p pid="a.73.0/3">The measure is spiteful because the Government insist on suggesting that it is somehow unfair that benefits have gone up by 20% when they know very well that 20% of very little is very little, and that in cash terms the average annual increase for those on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance over the past five years has been just &#163;2.37&#8212;that is hardly the life of Riley that Ministers are pretending. Again and again they frame the debate around misleading percentages instead of the reality of hard cash increases that are far lower for people on benefits than for those in work.</p>

We face a number of choices, and the key thing is where we decide that the axe is going to fall. His Government would like the axe to fall on the poorest and most vulnerable; I would prefer that it fell on those with the broadest shoulders. That is the difference between us. It is also important to say that his Government&#8217;s policies are draining demand out of the economy and making the deficit worse. If I were in his shoes, I would be looking to see why my own Government&#8217;s policies are exacerbating the deficit, not making it better.

	<p pid="a.74.1/1">I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on his attempt, but it was a bit feeble. All the evidence from Deutsche bank, the International Energy Agency and many other places tells us that rising fuel bills are a result of rising gas prices, and the percentage extra on people&#8217;s fuel bills that is coming from renewable energy, which, sadly, he is not a fan of, is very much smaller. I do not agree with his premise.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/2">If our priority is fairness, we should be seeking savings from those who can afford it, not penalising the poorest and pushing them into ever more precarious misery. Without this very basic link to RPI, what exactly are we saying to people on benefits? We are giving them a message of punishment that says, &#8220;You&#8217;ve done something wrong. It&#8217;s your fault that you don&#8217;t have a job and the state is going to make life hard for you.&#8221; Frankly, that is despicable. Oxfam says that it is Dickensian and rightly points out that slashing the incomes of those at the bottom is not just cold-hearted but wrong-headed, because it will depress the economy further.</p>
	<p pid="a.74.1/3">I said earlier that most people want to work, and I could cite very many examples from my own constituency of people who have come to my surgeries who are desperate for work but have been unable to find it. The link to RPI, as I have said, is essential. It is the absolute minimum acceptable. The Government have already taken from the poorest by switching to CPI and now they want to heap even more misery on people who simply cannot absorb it. Amendment 7 seeks to provide the most basic protection for benefits from the accumulative erosion of value that severing the historic link to prices will create. I commend the amendment, and hope to press it to a vote.</p>

	<p pid="a.75.3/1">The combined effect of both the statutory instrument and the Bill will, indeed, be for three years. I have no clairvoyant skills whatsoever and would never follow my forecasts on the future of the economy or prices, but the Bill is asking us to forecast what is likely to happen, particularly in relation to prices. In the context of food price volatility, which we know takes place, and of tremendous uncertainty in the energy market and, indeed, other markets, we are being asked to predict what the circumstances are likely to be in 2016, beyond the next general election.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/2">In his opening remarks, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" name="Ian Mearns">the hon. Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase> said that large swathes of people are out of work in some parts of the country and in work in other parts. There are also many places, including my own in west Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly, where a lot of people spend their lives going in and out of work because of the seasonality of the area&#8217;s economy. Not only are such people moving in and out of work&#8212;not of their own choice, but because of their circumstances&#8212;but there is also a plethora of zero-hours contracts and of people who exist on the basis of putting together part-time work.</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/3">I congratulate the Government on their achievement in rolling out apprenticeships, but the fact is that those apprentices are being paid &#163;2.65 an hour for their apprenticeship and have to do bar work, waitressing and other work at the weekend in order to get themselves up to a living wage. An apprenticeship offers a good opportunity, but we have to acknowledge that, among working people and those who are moving in and out of wages, there is a class or group who are, in effect, on the very margins of survival. They will be significantly affected by the proposal to peg benefits at 1%. Some argue that the Bill is about ensuring that we make work pay and that clause 1 is entirely about out-of-work benefits, but the fact is that a significant number of</p>
	<p pid="a.75.3/4">people&#8212;many thousands&#8212;who are in work or, indeed, in and out of work will be affected by it. That is the most difficult position.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.1/1">I agree with that point and congratulate in particular the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase> on advocating that for many years. He must be pleased. Indeed, I am pleased for him and it is appropriate that that policy is being rolled out. I hope that it will help to iron out the difficulties faced by a lot of people. Having said that, let us see whether it addresses those issues, as I hope it will, when it is rolled out.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/2">If we look back at the principles set out by the Chancellor in the first emergency Budget, we will see that we were clearly told that we were all in it together, that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the greatest burden and that the vulnerable would be protected. Those are the principles against which we must measure the Government. We all have different views on where the lines should be drawn with regard to achieving those objectives, and that is where we get into specifics such as those in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.76.1/3">It would be a kamikaze mission for me to begin a debate&#8212;I am only seven minutes into my speech&#8212;by asking my hon. Friend the Minister, for whom I have the highest respect: what on earth does he know about benefits? He is highly regarded in that sphere. He is respected considerably by people and, indeed, by his political opponents&#8212;and rightly so&#8212;for what he has achieved. I think we would have ended up with something a great deal worse had he not been in his position.</p>

	<p pid="a.76.3/2">To return to congratulating my hon. Friend the Minister on his achievements, my beloved coalition colleagues may not like what I am about to say&#8212;[Hon. Members: &#8220;Don&#8217;t say it!&#8221;] Having listened to what has been articulated by those in the Conservative party in recent months, we have to acknowledge what would have happened had my hon. Friend and, indeed, the Liberal Democrats not been in the coalition Government. First, we have to</p>
	<p pid="a.76.3/3">question whether we would have had the increase in the personal tax allowance, on which I congratulate the coalition Government. The Conservatives made it quite clear that they wished not only to freeze benefits altogether but to do so for six years, so we would not even be getting a 1% rise. There would have been a wider impact on pensioners and the disabled, which would have been significant. Child benefit would have been constrained, as well as being cut from families with more than two children.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making a powerful contribution. Given what he has said, does he reject the spin of some Government Members who have said that people on benefits have had their income uprated by 20% over a five-year period as opposed to 12.5% for those who work? When we examine the figures in cash terms&#8212;the impact on people&#8217;s pockets&#8212;we see that the uprating has been worth an average of &#163;49 for people in work and only &#163;12 or so for those who rely on benefits.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.1/1">There has been a lot of selective quotation of statistics, with selective beginnings and ends of the time period within which those comparators are applied. I understood that the purpose of the Bill was as the Secretary of State articulated it when he introduced it&#8212;to ensure that benefits would never rise faster than average wages. Our amendment would deal with that.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.2/1">My hon. Friend has suggested that people are referring to arbitrary time frames, but they are not. By looking at the past five years we can determine when the financial crisis began, so that is an entirely natural time frame to examine.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.3/1">One can look at it in a variety of ways. If we examined a much wider time period, say the past 20 or 30 years, we would certainly not come to the conclusion that benefits have risen significantly faster than wages, because that is clearly not the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.4/1">Will my hon. Friend acknowledge that the fiscal problem that the Government face began as a result of the financial crisis? It is therefore entirely logical to consider the matter over the period between the financial crisis beginning in 2008 and the present day.</p>

	<p pid="a.77.5/1">But when does the crisis end? The figures produced by the Office for Budget Responsibility estimate that in three years&#8217; time, wages will exceed CPI. One has to examine the matter over a much longer period. The Conservatives paid for some posters a couple of weeks ago to make the point that it was unacceptable for benefits to rise faster than wages, and the amendment would deal with that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/2">I said earlier that one big weakness of the Government&#8217;s proposal, and the reason why I opposed it, was the inflexibility of the 1% uprating. It takes no account of what may happen to food prices, for example, by 2015-16. It is all very well having a Bill that takes a clairvoyant view that a 1% increase will not press large numbers of working families, as well as out-of-work families, into severe and extreme hardship. However, we have experienced this year in the UK the impact of significant volatility in our climate. There has been significant climate change,</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/3">which is having an impact on the food baskets of the world, including those in many developing countries and here. We therefore need to ask ourselves whether we can confidently say that there will not be food price spikes such as we saw only a few years ago. I suggest that we may see such spikes again. There is also tremendous concern about the potential volatility of energy prices. The 1% uprating figure is inflexible and somewhat arbitrary, and we cannot say with confidence that we will not need to introduce further primary legislation to revise that figure in 2016.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/4">We must also consider the impact of the 1% uprating on housing. In their emergency Budget, the Government proposed to cut housing benefit from the 50th percentile of rents to the 30th percentile. Whether or not we like the fact that only 30% of the private rental market might be available to people in receipt of housing benefit, rather than half of it, it is essential that the rate is linked to the variation in private sector rents. The 1% uprating will break the link with what is available in the market and instead peg housing benefit back. In my area, and I know in many others, the Government&#8217;s attempt to peg it back by cutting the rate to the 30th per- centile of rents has failed to constrain private sector rents, so it has not had not the desired impact. Maybe it has in some areas, but certainly not in mine or many others.</p>
	<p pid="a.77.5/5">The measures that the Government have brought forward in the Bill have been ill thought through, and I fear that we will have to reconsider the figure set out in it next year or the year after. On that basis, we will listen to what the Minister says in response to the debate before we have the opportunity to divide the Committee on the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.78.0/2">One thing that has come across in the speeches of Members on both sides of the Chamber is the economic illiteracy of the Government&#8217;s policy as part of a strategy for reducing the deficit. As other Members have said, one of the great things about welfare payments is that when people are living on the bread line, the money that they receive is spent in the local economy, often within their own community or on their own estate. They spend it at their local convenience store. They tend to spend it the minute they get it, rather than put it in trust funds, because they are attempting to sustain their life on the bread line.</p>
	<p pid="a.78.0/3">When money is taken from the poorest in our society and at the same time given to the very wealthiest in our society, as was mentioned earlier, we are taking money away from people who will spend it in the real economy and giving it to people who are much more likely to take it out of the real economy and not spend it. It makes no economic sense, even on the basis that the Government are introducing this measure to reduce the deficit.</p>

We now see, however, that under those plans we were actually paying off the deficit faster than this Government are doing. That the Labour party was going to make tough decisions is reflected in a whole number of ways, and we supported&#8212;with tremendous reluctance&#8212;the very small uplift in public sector pay.

We would always like to make different decisions, but we are not always in a position to do so. There are a raft of things with which we have agreed that we would not have wanted. We have seen, however, from the policies that the hon.

Various retail businesses have gone bust and people are losing their jobs. A huge number of people in the public sector who were consumers are now not spending money, and the level of borrowing that the Government predict is higher than what the Labour party proposed under its policies.</p>

	<p pid="a.82.7/2">One issue I have raised previously in the context of the Bill is housing benefit changes. Last week, I met Chesterfield borough council officials to discuss the impact of the bedroom tax, which will hit people across Chesterfield in April. The council knows it faces a time bomb as people who cannot afford to pay their rents are told that there is a shortage of smaller properties for them to move to. Many of those people are at the back end of their working careers, and are either not working or in part-time employment. The council is budgeting for a situation in which around a third of them will fall into arrears&#8212;their housing-related benefits will be reduced and they will no longer have enough to pay their rents&#8212;and the Government are increasing the discretionary payment to allow councils to meet the costs of some who fall into that situation, which is a totally illogical policy. People who have been council house tenants for many years will fall behind, and the Government will give money to councils to bail them out. At the same time, the Government will hit them on housing and council tax benefit, and on tax credits. They are saying, &#8220;Those payments have already been cut, but they will now be increased by less than the rate of inflation.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.1/1">I will crack on, because I have not taken a useful intervention from Government Members yet, and other hon. Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/2">Many of the people I meet who face this financial calamity on the horizon have worked most of their lives. The people I meet who have worked for 30 years and then gone on to benefits are overwhelmed not by the generosity of benefits, but by the difficulty of getting by. They believe there must be an alternative benefits system that is incredibly generous&#8212;that is the one they read about in the papers&#8212;because it is tough to get by on the benefits that they receive.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/3">When we talk about the benefit bill, the most fundamental question we must confront is where the money goes. Most of it goes not into the pockets of benefit recipients, but into the pockets of landlords. The Thatcher Government introduced the right to buy. That was a good thing, but they did not have a corresponding scheme to replace the social housing that was lost, and there was chronic underinvestment in the remaining stock.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.1/4">The Blair Government rightly prioritised the refurbishment of social housing up to the decent homes standard over building new homes, but many Labour Members believe they took too long to take the housing shortage seriously. Although much of that was hidden during the good times, the welcome steps introduced by the Brown Government were too late and too slow to stop the housing crisis from escalating. Whomever we blame for the huge inflation in private rents, the people who claim housing benefit, whether they are working or not, are not to blame.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.3/1">I will try to plough on if I may, because many hon. Members want to speak, and I sense the Opposition deputy Chief Whip&#8212;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40619" name="Alan Campbell">the Member for Tynemouth (Mr Campbell)</phrase>&#8212;glaring at me with intent.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/2">In a raft of ways, tax credits cuts will hit people on low to middle incomes. By anyone&#8217;s definition, they are the thrifty, hard-working strivers that people across the political divide recognise are key to the country&#8217;s future prosperity, but they will be badly hit by the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/3">Once again, women and children will be hit worst of all. The Government&#8217;s strivers tax will hit women particularly hard&#8212;4.6 million women who receive child tax credit will be hit by the strivers tax, including 2.5 million working women. All those will come together as the perfect storm. The 1% uplift is nothing but a blunt political instrument designed to create a political trap that has nothing to do with a nuanced benefits system, with all its complexities.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/4">The Child Poverty Action Group has said that the 200,000 increase set out in the written answer from the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40663" name="Esther McVey">the hon. Member for Wirral West (Esther McVey)</phrase> should be added to the increase of 800,000 in children in relative income poverty by 2020 that the Institute for Fiscal Studies found in its analysis of the coalition&#8217;s welfare cuts. Let us remind ourselves of what the Prime Minister used to say about relative poverty. In 2006, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/5">&#8220;I believe that poverty is an economic waste and a moral disgrace. In the past, we used to think of poverty only in absolute terms&#8212;meaning straightforward material deprivation. That&#8217;s not enough. We need to think of poverty in relative terms, the fact that some people lack those things which others in society take for granted. So I want this message to go out loud and clear: the Conservative party recognises, will measure and will act on relative poverty.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.84.3/6">That is the manifesto on which Conservative Members were elected, and that was what they used to believe, but that is what they will vote against tonight when they support the Bill and reject the very reasonable amendment moved by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.0/1">I shall be brief as we are all conscious that we are increasingly up against the clock. I followed the progress of the argument and analysis by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40165" name="Toby Perkins">the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins)</phrase> with some interest. Had his predecessor in that seat been here tonight, he would most certainly have voted for the Liberal Democrat amendment, so I hope that the hon. Gentleman will maintain that proud Chesterfield tradition and join us in the Lobby later this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.85.0/2">As one who&#8212;like so many of my right hon. and hon. Friends&#8212;applauds so many of the initiatives that the coalition has been able to take, specifically in the field of social policy, I think that the input from the Liberal Democrats has been significant, not least from my hon. Friend the Minister of State who will have the arduous task of replying to the very wide diaspora of this debate later this evening. That input includes taking low-paid people out of tax altogether to moving in the direction of universal credit&#8212;I do not take the jaundiced view of many as to its prospects. I am delighted that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is in his place, because if we find, a little further down the track, that a little more constructive pressure needs to be placed on the Treasury to make things work that little bit better, he can certainly count on support from these Benches, because we think that the direction of travel on universal credit is very good. However, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" name="Andrew George">the Member for St Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> pointed out that the Bill sits at odds, both practically and philosophically, with developments of that type. He used the phrase &#8220;a blunt instrument&#8221; and I think that is a fair description. Our amendment would maintain a responsible position in relation to the wider issue of the deficit&#8212;and deficit reduction policy&#8212;in that benefits would not rise at a higher rate than earnings. That is responsible, consistent and a constructive contribution to the debate this evening.</p>

	<p pid="a.85.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman just described his amendment as a Liberal Democrat amendment. Can he confirm that all the Liberal Democrats will vote for it?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-01-21a.86.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40506" speakername="Charles Kennedy" colnum="86"  time="018:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0003.htm#13012130000077">
	<p pid="a.86.0/1">From my time as leader, and indeed from reading the memoirs of previous leaders, I know that no leader of the Liberal Democrats worth his salt would ever dare to predict how every Liberal Democrat was going to vote at any given time. But we hope that the critical mass will be such that it will send a helpful signal to those on the Treasury Bench and give me a sentence or two for my own memoirs, if I ever get round to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/2">I do not want to get into detail at this stage in the debate: my objection is more a philosophical and political observation. It is right that a party that can look back to a lineage including Beveridge and Lloyd George should make this reflection&#8212;that there is a large measure of political device about the Bill, which emanates in particular from the personage of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, aided and abetted by the Prime Minister. I say that because a tactical judgment has been made by the Conservative&#8212;not coalition&#8212;high command that this can be a very useful dividing stretch of water to place between themselves and, in particular, the Labour party with a view to the next election.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/3">We are not against the politics of choice, argumentation and the clash of ideas&#8212;what is the point of a House of Commons and a parliamentary democracy without that? But the insidious aspect of the Bill is that, in seeking to open up a philosophical divide of that type, it becomes not an issue of political leadership, but of political pandering to some of the fears, insecurities and downright prejudices that can be stoked up in society&#8212;the &#8220;us and them&#8221; mentality and the sense of resentment and envy. When people start playing fast and loose with those factors&#8212;and we have seen early examples against the backdrop of this legislation in the last week to 10 days &#8212;they are following a very risky strategy indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/4">I was pleased that the Deputy Prime Minister&#8212;the leader of my party&#8212;spoke out robustly against the initial posters and some of the leaflets that the Conservatives were producing. However, where the temptation of Her Majesty&#8217;s Britannic and historic Conservative and Unionist party is concerned about opportunism within the welfare state historically and playing that card to their advantage and to the disadvantage of others, I would take reassurances from them on that this week as assuredly as I would take reassurances on Wednesday night from the Prime Minister about the direction of their European policy. That is the fact of the matter. But if that is the game that we are playing&#8212;and I fear it is&#8212;the Liberal Democrats should ensure a clear distance between ourselves and the Conservatives, given our political lineage.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/5">My second point is, as my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives said, that the presence of my hon. Friend the Minister of State&#8212;and other colleagues, both in the coalition as Ministers and outside it&#8212;has added strength to the philosophical and practical arguments that we seek to bring to social policy. Before the last election, I shared a party platform at one of our conferences with the leader of my party. We were speaking about aspects of social policy, and the point I made to him and to the audience I repeat tonight. We can be tough-minded&#8212;indeed much more tough-minded than many an outside commentator ever expected the Liberal Democrats would or could be when the coalition was entered into two and a half years ago&#8212;and that has been proven. What we have to remind people of&#8212;with a view to the next election&#8212;is that our party and our cause is not just</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/6">about the head, but must also be about the heart. Many people will view this Bill as hard-hearted, and many will remember that when they come to cast their votes. In part, what we are trying to do here is remind that section of our electorate, our membership, our activists, our sympathisers and our supporters whom we want to come back over the second half of this Parliament, that while the head remains rigorous in government, the heart has not been lost in the wider environ that is UK Liberal Democracy.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/7">My final point is one that I believe my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase>, who has had such excellent and characteristically detailed input to our internal discussions, raised with the Prime Minister only last Wednesday at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions. In setting this arbitrary and post-2015 set of legislative strictures on what will happen to benefits uprating, what account had been taken of the difficult art of gazing into the crystal ball where future levels of inflation are concerned, not least where trends in food and energy prices are involved? The answer, frankly, in any fair-minded way, came there none from the Prime Minister to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.86.0/8">Thinking back to the awful events that the Prime Minister was describing in this House a few hours ago before this debate, if the Ministry of Defence ever committed itself to a course of action without some sense of a contingency there would great criticism from across the political spectrum. As drafted&#8212;which is why the amendment is so important&#8212;the Bill will commit the Government, and beyond what can be the lifetime of this Government and this Parliament, to a course of action for which there is no contingency. That is not a social, political or economic blank cheque that those of us who put our name to this amendment, and will vote for it, wish to extend.</p>

	<p pid="a.87.0/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40506" name="Charles Kennedy">the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr Kennedy)</phrase>, who made some telling points about the problems with the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/2">I rise to speak in support of amendment 12, moved by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>. The proposals to cut the real income of the poorest are ugly and unjust. I am pleased that the Secretary of State is in his place on the Front Bench. He frequently parades his Christian beliefs, so I shall begin by quoting from the Churches Regional Commission report, &#8220;Am I My Brother&#8217;s Keeper?&#8221;, which states that the switch in indexation</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/3">&#8220;represents an on-going erosion&#8230;effectively ratcheting up poverty long into the future.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/4">By 2015, the effect of 1% indexation compared with indexation in line with the CPI to a person on JSA or ESA will be a loss of &#163;156 a year; that is a 4% cut in real terms for those least able to afford it. If the Office for Budget Responsibility&#8217;s inflation forecast is wrong, the situation could be even worse.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/5">As we consider the Bill we need to look across at all the changes that the Government are making&#8212;we cannot look at this measure in isolation. To see the impact it will have on people, we need to look across the board.</p>
	<p pid="a.87.0/6">I now receive a lot of correspondence from constituents on ESA, who are particularly badly hit. I want to tell the House about one person. Her &#163;66 a week rent is paid by housing benefit. In April, her benefit will go up to &#163;71.70. Out of that, she pays &#163;10 a week for electricity, and &#163;6 a week for water rates. Like many of my constituents, she still uses coal for heating, and three bags of coal&#8212;just to inform the Minister, because I do not suppose he is up with coal prices&#8212;will cost her &#163;19.50 a week. Her return bus fare to the town&#8212;she lives in a village&#8212;is &#163;4 a week, and her bedroom tax is &#163;9.24 a week. All of that will leave her with &#163;22.96 for food, cleaning, all household goods and clothes. I submit that even <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40279" name="Richard Graham">the hon. Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)</phrase> could not live on &#163;22.96 a week. If he actually considered the sums of money that ordinary people will be expected to live on, he would understand the outrage we on this side of the House feel at the continuous erosion of the social security net.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for giving way after her passionate outburst. Yes, of course I share her concern about people on not very much money. My issue with the speech made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40165" name="Toby Perkins">the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins)</phrase> was his assumption that we were talking about people earning &#163;35,000 a year. I do not think he understands that the average wage in my constituency is less than &#163;25,000. We are talking about young nurses&#8212;people whose salaries are capped and who are seeing people on benefits get significantly larger increases. That is the issue at stake this evening.</p>

	<p pid="a.88.1/1">I am sorry, but the hon. Gentleman evidently does not understand the Bill. He evidently does not understand that people on those low wages will also lose out through the cuts to working tax credits and housing benefit. In fact, the whole point about the Government&#8217;s strategic, political mistake is that more people in work will lose out from the Bill than those who do not work. Furthermore, if he will allow me to do a little more arithmetic for him, a person currently on ESA will get a 70p increase in April, but a person earning &#163;25,000 and receiving a 1% increase will get a &#163;5 a week increase. Can he not understand that 70p is quite a lot less than &#163;5?</p>

	<p pid="a.88.3/1">I am not going to give way to the hon. Gentleman again, because other Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/2">I want to address the Minister. When, in the previous Parliament, we introduced the Bill that became the Child Poverty Act 2010, he gave a great deal of evidence from the Family Budgeting Unit in York and the people at Loughborough about the minimum income standard&#8212;the minimum income guarantee. He said that what the Labour Government were doing was absolutely shameful and that benefits were not high enough. Now, however, we see that he is prepared to cut benefits in a way that we never did. The testimony to the great success of this Government&#8217;s benefit policy is the expansion in the number of food banks: in Durham last year, the food bank fed 4,455 people, of whom 1,390 were children. That is utterly shameful. To demonstrate that it is not possible to live on &#163;22.96 a week, I am going to try to do</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/3">so during the February recess. Neither I nor, I believe, any other hon. Member seriously believes that they could live on &#163;22.96 a week. We have to look at this in context.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/4">The Bill is unjust because it is simply not fair in the treatment of people in work and those out of work, and the treatment of people on high incomes and people on low incomes. When the dole was introduced in 1912, it was approximately a fifth of average earnings, and so it stayed until 1979, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40121" name="Caroline Lucas">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase> said. By 1989, it was 15.8% of average earnings; by 1997, according to the House of Commons Library, it was 13.2%; and by 2015, it will be 11.1%. It is absolutely clear that the Government are trying to take it back to the very lowest point at the very bottom of the recession, irrespective of the impact on people&#8217;s normal standards of living. Everything the Prime Minister has said about those with the broadest shoulders bearing the biggest burden is seen to be utterly empty and fallacious when the Government introduce such a Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/5">There has been an ugly attempt to divide the poor between the &#8220;deserving&#8221; and the &#8220;undeserving&#8221;&#8212;taking us back to the 19th century&#8212;between sheep and goats, between strivers and shirkers, and between with those with their curtains closed and those with their curtains open. In my constituency, if people&#8217;s curtains are closed at 9 o&#8217;clock in the morning, it is probably because they are on nights and they are trying to catch up with their sleep. The Churches Regional Commission states that</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/6">&#8220;of all the words to describe those who depend on welfare, &#8220;feckless&#8221; has to be the one that rankles most.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/7">This attempt to divide has failed, however, on the factual ground that two thirds of those affected by the Bill are in work. The housing benefit and tax credit changes will affect far more people.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase>, who unfortunately is no longer present, tried to tell us that these changes will improve work incentives. As the noble Lord Freud said in the other House,</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/9">&#8220;there is an inevitable trade-off between the level of benefits and incentives to work. Raising benefit levels would undoubtedly hamper the work-incentive&#8221;.&#8212;[<i>Official Report, House of Lords, </i><phrase class="date" code="2011-10-13">13 October 2011</phrase>; Vol. 730, c. GC498.]</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/10">Obviously, that is setting to one side the fact that in order to work harder the poor must be made poorer, but the rich can be made richer.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.3/11">Let us look at the impact of the changes and the context. In my constituency, 7,200 people will lose out as a result of the Bill, by an average of &#163;500; that will take &#163;3.5 million out of the local economy. If the International Monetary Fund is correct, the second round effect will be even greater, at &#163;4.5 million, so the net upshot is an &#163;8 million loss to the economy of my constituency. It is no wonder shops are closing and small business are folding. That is absolutely illogical, and it goes against what the Chancellor of the Exchequer said about the need to let the fiscal stabilisers work.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.0/1">Yes, I can. It is absolutely obvious: we were in the middle of a very deep recession, which the hon. Gentleman seems conveniently to have forgotten. Of course the number of unemployed people has gone up, but the previous Labour Government helped all sorts of other people back into work&#8212;365,000 lone parents, for example. If he would care to look at a map of where incapacity benefit and ESA claimants live, he will see that it looks like a map charting the industrial revolution in the 18th century. Those benefit costs clearly reflect the overhanging legacy of the decline of heavy industry. It is totally unreasonable and unfair to punish the people who happened to work in heavy industry.</p>

We have seven people chasing every job vacancy. Whether the gap between the increase for a person on &#163;25,000 a year and the increase for a person on JSA is &#163;4.30 or &#163;4.20 will make no material difference to people&#8217;s capability or willingness to find a job, which is why we need a completely different approach to job creation.

	<p pid="a.90.2/2">The Chancellor of the Exchequer has broken another promise he made in 2011. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/3">&#8220;I also want to protect&#8230; those who, through no fault of their own, have lost jobs and are trying to find work&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-11-29.802"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 November 2011; Vol. 536, c. 802</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.90.2/4">He is patently failing to protect those people. By definition, people on statutory sick pay, statutory maternity pay, statutory paternity pay or statutory adoption pay are not going out to work, but they, too, are seeing their incomes fall, and that is at a time when they have new children coming into the family and need more support.</p>

	<p pid="a.90.4/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, but the point I am trying to make is that we have to look at the cumulative impact of all the changes. If he looks at the tax and benefits micro-simulation model produced by Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury, he will see that everybody in the bottom half of the distribution is a loser, but those people between 50% and 80% in the distribution are gainers. Therefore, he can understand that although the change to child tax credit&#8212;we will discuss it under the next group of amendments&#8212;might be very welcome, it is not doing the business because of the severity of the Government&#8217;s other reductions.</p>

	<p pid="a.91.4/1">I want to speak in support of amendment 10, to which I am a signatory. It is important to set the debate in context. In 2010, the Government inherited an economic mess from the previous Government, including a huge budget deficit, which is why difficult decisions have to be taken. It is important to remind the Committee that just before the previous Government left office, for every &#163;3 they raised, they were spending &#163;4, so borrowing was going up and up. It was interesting to listen to the opening remarks of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>. There was a lot of sound and fury, but little actual policy. In fact, Labour&#8217;s amendment would replace the 1% in the Bill with a blank space. Labour does not seem to have any policy at all. His remarks seemed to indicate that the policy, whatever it is, would cost a lot. I think that Labour&#8217;s policy of borrow and spend is still in place.</p>

	<p pid="a.92.0/1">Well, we did not hear any policy from the hon. Lady. I can only assume that she still follows the previous Government&#8217;s borrow-and-spend policies.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/2">I support amendment 10, rather than the Labour party&#8217;s &#8220;empty space&#8221; policy. Amendment 10 would have benefits increase in line with the increase in average earnings.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/3">The tax increases under this Government have quite rightly fallen most heavily on those with high incomes, who are paying a far higher proportion of their income in tax than under the previous Government&#8212;let us take, for example, the increase in capital gains tax. If there were a Liberal Democrat Government and not a coalition Government, the well-off would be paying far more tax&#8212;a mansion tax, for example. The Government have also helped people in low-paid jobs by increasing the personal allowance, which I hope will be raised to &#163;10,000 before the end of this Parliament. The work done by the Minister of State, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase> on universal credit will also help people on low incomes. Pensioners have also been protected from the cuts, because of the triple-lock guarantee, and my hon. Friend is introducing the new single-tier pension&#8212;another major achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/4">The group of people we are discussing this evening, whose incomes would be cut by clause 1, are those in receipt of working-age benefits, but not disability benefits. Coalition is all about negotiations and reaching compromises. It is important to note what would be happening to welfare benefits if we had a Conservative Government and not a coalition. We know from statements in the public domain that a Conservative Government would propose a benefits freeze, not a 1% increase, and that the cuts would apply to all benefits, not just those listed this evening. Such a freeze would last for several years&#8212;not just three years, as under the coalition Government&#8217;s policy&#8212;and child benefit would be awarded only for the first two children in the household. These are all policies that a Conservative Government would introduce, but which the coalition is not. We also know, as was made evident earlier&#8212;certainly from the cheers on the Conservative Benches behind me&#8212;that a Conservative Government would reduce the top rate of tax to 40%, not leave it at 45%. Liberal Democrats in government have achieved a great deal in lessening the impact on welfare benefits uprating, compared with a purely Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/5">However, my main concern about the measures in the Bill&#8212;this echoes concerns raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> and others who have spoken&#8212;is that committing the country to a 1% increase for three years now, before we know what inflation will be when the increase comes into effect, could end up being harmful to people on low incomes, because we have absolutely no idea how much world fuel and food prices will rise in those three years. I recognise the strength of the argument that benefits for people out of work should not rise at a higher rate than the earnings of those in work, which is why amendment 10 proposes to increase such benefits by the same percentage as the rise in average earnings over the previous year. Amendment 10 would be a fair compromise between the need to cut the deficit and the need to provide a safety net for those dependent on welfare benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/6">There has been a lot of talk about scroungers and curtains being drawn. I entirely reject such rhetoric. It is important to note that strong sanctions are available for those receiving jobseeker&#8217;s allowance. For example, people can lose their jobseeker&#8217;s allowance for up to three years if they do not apply for a job that their adviser tells them about, do not accept a suitable job offer, leave a job voluntarily, lose their job because of misconduct or do not take part in a compulsory Work programme. Therefore, sanctions are indeed available.</p>
	<p pid="a.92.0/7">I represent a very rural constituency. It is important to point out that prices on islands or remote parts of the mainland are higher than in most of the rest of the country, and that people on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance in remote areas who are finding it difficult to get a job in the area in which they live are on very low incomes. We should not commit ourselves to only a 1% increase for the next three years, because we do not know what will happen to prices during that time.</p>

	<p pid="a.93.0/1">Would my hon. Friend acknowledge that if we had applied the logic that he is now advocating over the last five or six years and pegged benefits to wage rate inflation, the people he is talking about&#8212;the people he is trying to help&#8212;would be far worse off?</p>

	<p pid="a.93.1/1">A lot depends on where we start. If we are talking about rises matching prices or wages, it all depends on the starting point&#8212;if we pick a different starting point, we get a different result.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/2">I was talking about the next three years. We know what the rise in average earnings was last year, so obviously we know what the rise in benefits would be in 2013-14. We do not know what it would be in 2014-15 or 2015-16, but setting the increase to the rise in average earnings, rather than a fixed rate of 1%, would mean that as the economy gradually grew, the level of growth in the economy would be paid to those on benefits, as well as those in work. That is a better approach than having a fixed rate of 1% for three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/3">No Government have control over world food and energy prices. At Prime Minister&#8217;s questions last week I raised this potential problem when I asked the Prime Minister what contingency plans the Government had for benefit increases, should food and energy prices rise by more than expected. He answered by pointing to the good work being done by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change to ensure that energy companies put people on the lowest available tariffs. That will indeed be a big help to people on low incomes, but if energy prices rise by more than expected, the lowest tariff will rise by more than expected too. After I heard the Prime Minister&#8217;s answer, I am afraid that I was left to form the conclusion that the Government have no contingency plans for a scenario in which prices rise by more than expected. I hope that when my hon. Friend the Minister replies to this debate, he will be able to reassure me on that point. I hope there is a plan B, in case world prices go up by more than expected.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/4">Setting future increases to the increase in average earnings would address the legitimate argument that out-of-work benefits should not rise faster than earnings and would help to cut the deficit. For example, if the CPI figure were used for 2013-14, benefits would increase by 2.2%. If average earnings were used, they would increase</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/5">by 1.6%, saving half the amount that a 1% increase would save. It is also important to point out that cutting public spending on its own will not eliminate the deficit. We need to grow the economy as well. All the economic research indicates that money put into the pockets of people on low incomes is far more likely to be spent straight away than it would be by those on higher incomes. Not increasing welfare benefits by the rate of inflation will have an impact on shops and other businesses, as well as the recipients themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.93.1/6">To sum up, linking benefit increases to average earnings is much fairer all round and avoids committing ourselves to a fixed figure unnecessarily far in advance. I hope that the Committee will support amendment 10, and I hope that you will allow it to be put to a vote, Mr Amess.</p>

Are we a country that is content to see the doubling of food banks under this Government since May 2010, as 1.4 million people in work find themselves needing to resort to credit to help to pay the rent or the mortgage each month? Are we a country that will fall for the cynical &#8220;divide and rule&#8221; tactics of the Chancellor, which treat people as pawns in a squalid political game, amid a campaign of demonising the poor and turning neighbour against neighbour, when a responsible Government would seek to unite people rather than divide the country?

	<p pid="a.94.2/1">On this pleasant occasion, I find that I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. Let us hope that that agreement will continue when he contributes to the debate later, and in future debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/2">These measures are not pro-growth, as they were included in the analysis from the Office for Budget Responsibility in December that further downgraded growth forecasts for this year by 0.8% of gross domestic product. They are not pro-deficit reduction, as unemployment is set to become 340,000 higher than the</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/3">level predicted by the OBR in 2010, and benefit bills will be &#163;13 billion higher than forecast. They are not pro-equality either, as two thirds of the real-terms cuts introduced by clauses 1 and 2 will hurt women, and three-fifths of them will hurt working families.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/4">If the Government believe that they are standing up for fairness in the midst of the longest slump for 140 years, this must be either the most incompetent or the most misguided set of measures since those proposed by the National Government in 1931. On every count, they will increase, not cut, inequality in our country, given that 71% of the households affected are on or below the average income, and that 60% of the total savings from the Bill will come from the poorest third on the income scale. Only 3% will come from the wealthiest third. On no count can these measures be described as fair. How on earth can the Government believe that it is right to introduce a 4% real-terms cut in benefits until 2015 while continuing to pay top-rate pension tax relief to top-rate taxpayers at a rate of 50p in the pound? They are doing that while impoverishing the very poorest people at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="a.94.2/5">Unemployment in my constituency remains consistently high at more than 4,000, or 12% of the working-age population. Although more than two thirds of jobless people experience only a few months out of work at the most, there are more than 1,300 people there who have been out of work for a year or more. Within that group, some 600 people have been out of work for two years or more. If the Government were serious about welfare reform, they would accept that ending the crushing blow of such long-term joblessness, which saps the human spirit and harms long-term job prospects&#8212;as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40453" name="Andrew Bridgen">the hon.

They could easily do that. I hope that they will look at the example set by Glasgow city council in introducing a successful jobs fund for the young jobless, because such a measure would supersede the measures in clause 1. Countries such as Sweden, which many in the Scottish Government often ask people in Scotland to emulate, have used jobs guarantee policies very successfully indeed for nearly two decades, while reducing their deficit at the same time.</p>

	<p pid="a.96.5/1">I would welcome any measures from any tier of Government that would increase the level of training and skills provided to my constituents and those in other Scottish constituencies. I have to say to the hon. Lady, however, that I have two major colleges in my constituency&#8212;North Glasgow college and John Wheatley college&#8212;which have seen staggering levels of cuts introduced by the Scottish Government. That is driving more young people in my constituency into</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/2">unemployment and creating the very figures that allow those on the Treasury Bench to produce measures such as those in clause 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.5/3">Even in constituencies such as mine, it is still the case that people move in and out of unemployment. The calculated framing of this debate by the Government, based on the fabricated and manufactured premise that there is a monolithic army of the permanently idle, unwilling even to open their curtains, and defrauding the system, wilfully ignores that fact. Fraud in the benefit system is only 0.7%, and many unemployed people, including many of my constituents, are struggling hugely on just &#163;71.40 a week. Unemployment benefit as a proportion of average income has fallen from 22% in 1979 to a mere 15% now, so the argument from those on the Treasury Bench that unemployment benefit is somehow unaffordable and that it cannot continue into the decades to come is simply a false premise to put to the Committee tonight.</p>

	<p pid="a.97.0/1">Would my hon. Friend like to point out to Government Members that, in the days when jobseeker&#8217;s allowance and its predecessors represented a higher proportion of earnings than now, we also had lower unemployment?</p>

	<p pid="a.97.1/1">That is absolutely right. We also had lower levels of long-term unemployment than we have now. As I and other Members have pointed out, high levels of long-term unemployment decrease the earnings potential of the people afflicted by that social evil.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/2">Only today, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation published a survey of poverty in Scotland which revealed that a baby boy born in the richest 10% of Scottish neighbourhoods has a life expectancy 14 years higher than that of a baby boy born in the poorest 10% of such neighbourhoods. Having a 4% real-terms cut in unemployment and other out-of-work benefits of the sort contained in clause 1 is going to make those figures in Scotland even worse. I urge the Government to think again, to accept amendment 12 and to reduce the terrible social damage that will be caused if this measure becomes law.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/3">I hope that, at this eleventh hour, the Government will decide to make policy on the basis of evidence, rather than reintroduce some Victorian distinction between the deserving and the undeserving poor. I urge them to think again about the impact that clause 1 will have, ensuring that 90% of those in out-of-work benefits will, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, be an average of &#163;215 a year worse off. They should consider the effect that will have not just on high streets in our towns, villages and cities but on the local shop. They should think about the amount of economic demand that will be taken out of local communities, the jobs that will go as a result of the passing of this measure in this form tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/4">The Government ignore the inconvenient truth that out-of-work benefits constitute just 3% of the welfare budget, and that outside of pensions, most welfare spending ensures that work pays for many of our citizens. Nearly three in 10 of my constituents earn less than the living wage of &#163;7.45 an hour. Although introducing a living wage in those parts of the economy where it will work would save money in lower tax credit costs, we, like many other countries, need a strong tax credit</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/5">system to reduce imbalances within the labour market that would otherwise cause unacceptable levels of inequality. The simple truth is that most poverty in Britain today is among the working poor. It is mainly the working poor who are losing out as a result of these measures. They will be the biggest victims if this iniquitous Bill were to become law, with a real-terms 4% cut in their living standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/6">In Scotland, as a result of these measures, some 261,000 working families, nearly one in five, would lose an average of &#163;259 a year by 2015&#8212;the antithesis of work paying for those 261,000. About 70% of the tax credit cuts will affect working families in Scotland. The median wage in my constituency is less than &#163;17,600 a year, and many thousands of people will be savagely hurt by clause 1, as Citizens Advice outlined in its submission. A couple on just &#163;13,000 with two children will lose nearly 5% of their income as a result of this Bill, completely overwhelming any benefit from increasing personal tax allowances, which is worth just 13p a week to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.97.1/7">This debate is not just about the measure before us; it is a debate about the values of this Government and the priorities of our society. This Bill impoverishes the poor, without reducing the deficit; it makes inequality worse, adding 200,000 to the child poverty figures, leaving 1 million more children in poverty by 2020. This clause is a provision that will cause enormous hardship to some of the poorest people in society, and it will devastate economic demand in constituencies such as mine. I urge the Committee to endorse amendment 12 and to vote against clause 1.</p>

	<p pid="a.98.0/1">I am grateful to be called to contribute to this Committee debate. Many of tonight&#8217;s speeches have made me feel that I live in a different world from the one in which my constituents and a large number of people in this country live. I propose to Labour Members that the world in which they live is one far removed from reality.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.0/2">When this Government came to office in 2010, the coalition confronted the worst peacetime deficit in Britain&#8217;s history. That fact cannot be repeated often enough. This is the architecture and the framework through which every single decision has been made since the formation of that Government. It is particularly nauseating to see Labour Members berate the Government for trying to make very tough choices and trying to make savings when they were the architects responsible for the chronic and devastating mismanagement of our public finances; and it is particularly nauseating to see those Members berate and accuse the Government of being purely political in respect of this very difficult measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.0/3">We know what has happened in the eurozone. We have seen the devastation that reckless public spending has brought to Greece, Spain and other countries. If we looked at how they dealt with their deficits, we would see that their particular approach has been far more severe than anything we have seen in this country. Indeed, unemployment benefit in Greece was cut by 20%&#8212;a savage, swingeing cut to benefits&#8212;and that was done to balance the books. In Ireland, we have seen cuts in public sector wages and cuts in child benefit. I am not</p>
	<p pid="a.98.0/4">suggesting for a minute that we should go down that route. What I am saying is that this is the kind of response that other sovereign countries have had to make to deal with the very serious public finance hole in which they found themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.98.0/5">It is also particularly nauseating for Labour Members to pretend that we do not face this grave crisis and to pretend that there are endless streams of public money that we can just keep spending. This is absolutely the wrong approach, and it sends a bad signal to the country. The country knows that Labour spent too much money and that some difficult choices have had to be made. One of the more responsible Labour Members, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40165" name="Toby Perkins">the hon. Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins)</phrase>, openly acknowledged that even a Labour Government would have had to find savings in this particular period.</p>

	<p pid="a.99.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman not appreciate the reason why this particular Bill and its measures have been called &#8220;political&#8221;? It was clear in the autumn statement that the Chancellor intended these measures to be some sort of political trap. In making choices, any Government would not be looking only at the contents of this Bill. I would be happy to talk about a much wider range of choices, so why can we not have a wider Bill?</p>

	<p pid="a.99.1/1">In my opening remarks, I made a wider point about the eurozone. This is exactly what goes to the heart of the issue. What those countries have done to deal with their fiscal crisis&#8212;I am not saying we should follow it, but we have to remember that their deficits are better than ours at the moment&#8212;is to make swingeing cuts to public spending in the form of benefits. We have not done that. We have spared our people that measure of severity, but we have to recognise that a large portion of spending goes in this direction and that the savings we are making are in the region of &#163;3.7 billion a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/2">Our coalition colleagues, the Liberal Democrats have said that the time frame is arbitrary. Some people have talked about 1912&#8212;more than 100 years ago&#8212;and some have talked about the last 30 years. I am not interested in the last 30 years. I am interested in what is happened since the financial crisis. I am interested in what has happened since Labour got us into the mess we are in. I accept that it is an international mess and that there is a world crisis, but the fact remains that, at &#163;170 billion, this was a much larger deficit than that of any of our competitor or partner countries in the OECD. In that context, something had to give. We had to make some very tough choices about spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/3">Let me consider some of the provisions. There is clearly a measure of disagreement over how we should approach this aspect of welfare spending. I have yet to hear from Opposition Members by how much they think benefits should rise. We have heard one suggestion, although admittedly it came from the only member of the Green party in the House. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40121" name="Caroline Lucas">The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase> seemed to be saying that she would have raised the rate in line with the retail prices index. When asked how much that would cost, she blithely replied &#8220;&#163;7.4 billion&#8221;&#8212;I am sorry, it was &#163;7.6 billion&#8212;as if that were a snip. It is to her credit that she at least had the honesty to spell out what are, in my view, the disastrous fiscal implications of her policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.99.1/4">Labour members have given no such undertakings. They have made no such statements about what their policies would actually cost. They have simply wailed and moaned about the harshness of the Government, without in any way recognising the severity of the crisis that we face.</p>

	<p pid="a.100.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that it is not just a question of welfare policies, but a question of employment or, in the case of the Labour party, unemployment policies?

	<p pid="a.100.2/1">I am pleased to note that my hon.

That is the sort of barmy universe that was constructed under the last Administration, and it is something that we have had to redress. When we consider matters such as those that we are considering today, we must always bear in mind that, given a budget deficit of &#163;170 billion&#8212;more than 12% of GDP&#8212;it is very difficult to curb public spending sufficiently to enable the country to pay its way on a sustainable basis.</p>

Does he agree that it is unfair for people earning more than &#163;70,000 a year to be paid tax credits, but very fair that people earning just &#163;10,000 a year&#8212;who paid &#163;1,160 in tax and national insurance in 2010&#8212;will now pay only &#163;670, and even fairer that next year they will pay only &#163;360?

I cannot speak for everyone in the country, but the vast majority of people are much less well off than they were in those days. What has happened to benefits since then? According to the figures that we have heard, they have increased by 20% while the earnings of people in work have risen by 10%. That is not fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.101.1/3">Labour Members have talked of fairness. For instance, the hon. Member for Chesterfield argued eloquently that 1% on &#163;70 a week was very different from 1% on &#163;35,000 a year. However, it is not the people on &#163;35,000 a year about whom we are worried; it is the people on very low incomes. People in my constituency who do night shifts at Heathrow come to me and ask &#8220;Why did out-of-work benefits rise by 5% last year? I earn &#163;11,000 a year if I am lucky and work 20 hours a week, but I was not given such a big increase.&#8221; That is the sort of fairness that we are talking about. This is a really important issue, which Opposition Members have not addressed in any way.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.2/1">Is not the answer to the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question&#8212;which applies to people on low incomes in my constituency as much as to those in his&#8212;that those who have worked hard and have low incomes, but have paid their taxes and done the right thing, can still lose their jobs through no fault of their own and find themselves trying to subsist on seventy quid a week, and that we do not want to make things more difficult for those people? I think that very few of them are scroungers, and most want to get back to work as fast as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.101.3/1">I accept what the hon. Gentleman says, but I am talking about the position in general. It cannot be right, arithmetically, for benefits to rise, year after year, faster than the wages of the low-paid people to whom he has referred. However, we must look at the overall picture. The 1% increase is not very much. I know that some Government Members proposed a cash freeze, and I am glad to note that the Government have not adopted that severe option; but in the context of the European and the global financial crisis, a cash freeze is not completely off the table. We have seen other countries take extremely tough measures. Why have they done that? They have not done it because they want to limit demand, as the hon. Member for Glasgow North East suggested. They have not done it because they want to hurt people on low incomes. They have done it because they feel that the fiscal future&#8212;the future of the state: the future of their countries&#8212;requires a tough approach to public spending.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.1/1">Jonathan Portes is not right. I do not think that anything he has ever written&#8212;I read his blog&#8212;makes any sense whatsoever, and I am happy for <i>Hansard</i> to record that.

The automatic stabilisers are working; in cash terms, a lot of our spending in these elements is higher than it was. That is a clear sign that the automatic stabilisers are working.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.3/1">That is absolutely right.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.3/2">I shall try to keep my closing remarks brief. The 1% rise in the uprating is surely a temporary measure; I would not want to see this in perpetuity. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham talked about the need to combat inflation. Clearly if inflation is sustained at 3% or 4% over years, that would be very punitive and would make the proposed measures even more difficult for people to bear. So the Government need to keep a firm handle and an eagle eye on the inflation rate. I am absolutely in favour of that, but on the general approach I would not want to see any amendments to this Bill. It is a difficult proposal that we are trying to push through, but many people up and down the country are supporting the Government on it because they feel that the measures we are introducing are encouraging people to get out to work. People also realise&#8212;I will close where I started off my speech&#8212;the appalling fiscal legacy given to us, the incredibly difficult financial circumstances in which the Government found themselves, and the tough and courageous measures we are taking to get us out of the mess.</p>

	<p pid="a.102.4/1">I rise to support the amendment because it is very clear: it seeks to tear the heart out of this Bill, and it should tear the heart out of the Bill, because it is a terrible Bill. By taking this stance, I am not saying that we should not, with all urgency, think about welfare reform, because that is a</p>
	<p pid="a.102.4/2">mega task which will face a succession of Governments. I am not saying that we do not recognise that there is a real problem in this country with incentives to work, because there is. I am not saying that there are not all sorts of other issues that we need to deal with and consider in relation to this measure. We have to consider what this measure is actually about.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.4/3">I agree totally with the Government Members who said how serious the fiscal deficit is. I do not doubt that when Labour breaks the trend and has to clear up a mess&#8212;we have been hearing this afternoon about Tories clearing up our mess&#8212;we might well have to look at the size of the welfare bill. However, I do not believe that any Labour Government would get cuts through without presenting them in a context in which the cuts were thought to be fair. That goes to the heart of the current Government&#8217;s strategy. Despite the rhetoric in which they have tried to clothe themselves in respect of the changes they have been making, the country will have to make a judgment in the election on whether the Government have fulfilled the assurance they gave at the beginning of this journey that who had most would pay most and those who had least would be protected. It is no accident that we link the amendments being debated tonight with the tax cuts in the Budget for those who have most.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.4/4">We will not have to face this issue tonight because, sadly, we know how the vote is likely to go, despite the presence of some brave Liberals&#8212;I hope that my saying that encourages even more to vote, knowing that it is safe to register their protest. In the end, it is those outside this House who will judge whether this measure is fair. Is it fair that, at time when we can find moneys to make tax cuts for the very richest, we cut living standards for the very poorest?</p>

	<p pid="a.103.1/1">No, I am going to make a short speech. I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s interest and the way he is following my speech, but I do not want to extend it.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/2">The country will make a judgment about how fair the collection of measures is. I think the Government must be extremely confident, given that we are seeing a record number of people who are hungry and are turning up at food banks operating in our constituencies. Thank God for food banks. I do not hold the view that food banks are terrible; it is great that we have them, because people are hungry. I think it is terrible that we live in society where people are hungry. That is where we should direct the anger; it should not be aimed at the people providing the food banks. We are thinking about cutting benefits at a time when we also know that people who probably have greater abilities than I do in managing on a low income&#8212;thank God, I have never had to do so&#8212;find that they fail. The Bill will crush some decent people, who find it impossible to live on the levels of income that we lay down.</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/3">That we should do this at a time when we can find the money for the richest to take more passes all my understanding. Perhaps the Opposition will lose the vote tonight, but I am not so sure that, on this argument, an indelible mark will not now be made against the</p>
	<p pid="a.103.1/4">coalition Government, who found money to cut taxes for the very rich while making life more and more difficult for the poor, some of whom do not have enough to eat. Should more people join that terrible queue of our fellow citizens? Lots of other arguments have been marvellously put, but for me it comes down, as I guess it will for the electorate, to whether this is fair. I think that they will say no.</p>

	<p pid="a.104.2/1">Thank you, Mr Amess, for calling me to speak in this debate. I will follow your advice and try to be as brief as I can.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/2">Tonight I came to listen to different views on options for this Bill, and we have heard an interesting mix of practical ideas, impractical ones and vacuums. Much of the debate has been wrapped in an argument about, on the one hand, who can claim the moral ground as the more compassionate and, on the other, who can claim to be more practical on economics.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/3">We have just heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase>, for whom I have enormous respect. He made the argument that this is ultimately all about fairness, but given that Labour Members wanted to retain child benefits for all higher-rate taxpayers, no matter how many millions they earn, I find it hard to take that argument at face value. I also reject the bizarre argument about taxing the richest by more than his party ever did in its 13 years in power&#8212;that raising &#163;7 billion less in tax revenue for services that all our poorest constituents most value is somehow beneficial to our poorest and most vulnerable members of society.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/4">On the proposals that have actually been made, the only person who emerges with real credit for honesty is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40121" name="Caroline Lucas">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase>. She has the guts to say that these benefits should be uprated now and for ever by the retail prices index, at a preliminary cost of some &#163;7.6 billion. She might have some idea where that money will come from&#8212;I am sure she does not, as certainly none of the rest of us does&#8212;but at least she has tried to put a value on her compassion. Personally, I think that it is as practical as some of her efforts to spread wind farms across the country, in a passion for green energy for which our constituents will also pay heftily through their energy bills, but that is a separate matter. At least she has put a mark on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="a.104.2/5">In contrast, Opposition Members, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" name="Helen Goodman">the hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase>, disappearing from her seat after speaking at great volume, and the hon. Members for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain) and for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins) were unable to say with what they would replace the Government&#8217;s proposed uprating of 1%. It was as if they would offer a happy vacuum in which we would depend on the munificence of the shadow Secretary of State&#8212;he who famously apologised for having no money left&#8212;who would somehow to find the money to fill it.</p>

He will accept that hitherto in this country, and for many years, the proposal to uprate benefits has been presented annually and much closer to the time at which uprating should take place, so that the Chancellor can take account of the latest economic circumstances and the latest level of inflation.

That is the bill that all our constituents are having to pay today.</p>
	<p pid="a.105.3/2">It is not surprising that the Government are having to take the risk&#8212;I accept that there is an element of risk&#8212;of pre-setting the uprating of these benefits without knowing what the level of inflation will be. That is why my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> was right. Hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-01-21a.106.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" speakername="Eilidh Whiteford" colnum="106"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0003.htm#13012136001277">
	<p pid="a.106.4/1">I start by paying tribute to the work of the Scottish Campaign on Welfare Reform, which has done so much to draw attention to the impact of the measures in the Bill. It speaks volumes that more than 60 charities, Churches, other faith groups and trade unions have come together to speak with one voice to express their concerns about this heartless Bill and to support amendments that might mitigate some of its most adverse impacts.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/2">The problem with what we are debating tonight is that an uprating cap of 1% is entirely arbitrary. It will inevitably cause hardship not just to those on low incomes but to those on middle incomes. I want to try to focus on amendment 7, which was supported so eloquently by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40121" name="Caroline Lucas">the Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase>. It is important that we try to restore a link to prices this evening. The problem with a below-inflation flat-rate uprating of benefits is that it represents a real-terms cut in the incomes and living standards of those who already live in the most straitened circumstances and will continue to do so for the next three years. Some 70% of those who are adversely affected are families with children and an estimated two thirds of the savings derived will be taken from the pockets of people in low-paid or part-time work.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/3">Tonight, we have repeatedly heard, not least from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40279" name="Richard Graham">the hon. Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)</phrase>, that it is unfair, when people in work may be receiving below-inflation rises, not to impose a real-terms freeze in the</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/4">uprating of benefits. That is a particularly facile argument, which we rehearsed on Second Reading. It goes without saying that whereas someone with a job with average pay would receive &#163;200 or &#163;300 for a 1% increase, depending on whether they were a man or a woman, a person on benefits of &#163;70 a week would see an annual increase of &#163;36. That probably would not even take me beyond the boundaries of my own constituency. It is wrong to pretend that 1% of not very much is equivalent to 1% of an average salary&#8212;or, indeed, of the very generous salary that so many people in this place enjoy.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/5">As others have highlighted, there is a great deal of uncertainty in the Bill. If inflation stays in line with OBR predictions, the Government&#8217;s approach will result in a 4% real-terms cut in tax credits and benefits by 2015. That is a very big &#8220;if&#8221;, though: the OBR&#8217;s crystal ball has not been very effective to date and it has certainly not been good at predicting inflation&#8212;or, pretty much anything else. If inflation is higher than the guesstimates from the OBR, the impact on low and average-income households will be greater than we predict today. That is why we must preserve the link between social protection payments and the cost of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/6">The Government&#8217;s distributional analysis of the impact of the autumn statement shows that next year the people in the five lowest income deciles will be worse off as a consequence of the cumulative impact of the Government&#8217;s changes to the tax and benefits system, and the least affluent will be the most affected. In contrast, three out of five people on average incomes and above will be better off. That exposes the truth of the matter: the Government have set themselves priorities and made choices that make those on low and average incomes pay for the tax breaks for the very wealthy. The poorer half of our society is being asked to carry the can for a financial crisis and a failure of political leadership that is not of its making, rather than seeing that burden shared across society.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/7">The other key point that I want to make this evening&#8212;again, one that I made on Second Reading&#8212;echoes points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" name="Ian Mearns">the hon. Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase> earlier today. It is that the measures of inflation that we use are not especially good at measuring the impact of inflation on lower income households. We know that low income households spend a far greater proportion of their resources on essentials such as food and domestic fuel. In the past five years, food prices have risen by around 30%, and the prices of some staple foods, such as potatoes, have risen by 40%. Projections for next year are for rising prices for a number of staple commodities because of poor harvests in north America and many parts of Europe, not least in our own country. Thrifty shoppers, as we know, are adept at switching to cheaper brands when money is tight, but when global prices are on an upward trajectory there is often nowhere to hide.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/8">The other disproportionate expense for low income families is domestic energy, which is another area where prices have soared and fluctuated in recent years. The 20% increases in gas prices announced before Christmas are just the latest in a series of cumulative hikes in the price of fuel in recent years. There is snow on the ground outside today; that may be unusual here in London, but it is just normal winter weather in</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/9">my constituency. In such conditions, families, especially families with young children, need to heat their homes adequately.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/10">Although neither the consumer prices index nor the retail prices index captures the full impact of inflation on the lowest income households, the retail prices index includes some housing costs and is more likely to reflect the actual inflation that poor people experience. The Bill will cause tangible hardship, quantifiable in real money terms and in practical ways for people on low incomes. Hundreds of thousands of people who are disabled, who are carers, who are lone parents, will be particularly hard hit. It will hit families, whether they are in or out of work, dealing with the added expense of bringing up children. It will not cut the deficit&#8212;indeed, it will take money out of local economies and inhibit recovery at a time when we should be trying to get local economies going. On the basis of the Government&#8217;s own assessment, 200,000 more children will be pushed into poverty by this part of the Bill alone. We know that the long-term cost of child poverty cannot be measured only in financial terms. The long-term implications for children who grow up in deprivation are well quantified. The results are devastating and store up problems for the future, some of which we are still dealing with from the last period of austerity and the last poverty measures back in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/11">Dickens has been mentioned several times today. Whereas some speakers have talked of &#8220;A Christmas Carol&#8221; and the days of Scrooge, I was set thinking of &#8220;A Tale of Two Cities&#8221;, and indeed a tale of two countries. Today the Scottish Government announced an extra &#163;5.7 million for advice services to support people who have to face the problems associated with these welfare cuts. It is a sad state of affairs when people are using food banks; it is a sad state of affairs when disabled people who, through no fault of their own, cannot persuade an employer to give them a job, are being pushed further into poverty and are being blamed and vilified for the state of the wider economy. People in Scotland have a choice and I look forward to the day they will get to make that choice in a referendum on their future governance, because never again will they have to take the Tory policies that they did not vote for.</p>
	<p pid="a.106.4/12">Amendment 7 would make this deeply flawed Bill slightly less iniquitous and slightly less unfair, and would ensure that the very poorest families do not carry a disproportionate share of the burden in tough economic times. I urge Members across the Chamber to support us this evening when we push it to a vote.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-01-21a.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" speakername="John McDonnell" colnum="108"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0003.htm#13012136001278">
	<p pid="a.108.0/1">I apologise, Mr Amess, for persisting in seeking to speak at this late hour. I sat through the five hours of Second Reading and time did not permit me to be called then, and I have tabled an amendment tonight which we will not reach. One could become paranoid at times. I wanted the opportunity to set out my views briefly on this core element of the Bill for my own constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/2">I will vote for every amendment that seeks to ameliorate the Bill. That includes the amendments that have been tabled from both sides, including by my own party. I feel there is a moral imperative to do so. There was a consensus for a time in our country about how we dealt with welfare benefit upratings: they would increase on the basis of either earnings or inflation, whichever was</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/3">the higher. That consensus was achieved because there was a moral commitment to protect the poorest in our society&#8212;in a civilised society. It went alongside a steady rise in wages at the time. What we have seen recently&#8212;it has impacted on my constituents particularly&#8212;is wage cuts and wage freezes across the public sector and in some parts of the private sector. I opposed the wage freeze in the public sector that was supported by my own party.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/4">In the past 12 or 15 months we have seen a succession of measures&#8212;more than a dozen key measures&#8212;that have cut the income of my constituents. The Bill is the last straw. People in my constituency are suffering and will suffer more as a result of this measure. As I mentioned in a recent debate in Westminster Hall, there is a gulf between the views and experiences of some Members of the House and the experiences of many of our constituents and the way that they suffer. I thought that might be particular to my community&#8212;a working-class multicultural community that is taking a battering at present&#8212;but I looked at some of the statistics in the briefings that were prepared for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/5">The Government&#8217;s own household survey of those living below the average wage identified 11% of families in that category who cannot keep their homes warm. I looked at the Save the Children survey, which found that 14% of children do not have a warm coat this winter. I looked at the survey undertaken by Contact a Family, the charity that works with families who care for disabled children. It was an extensive survey which found one in six families going without food, one in five without heating, one in four without the specialist adaptations that they need, and a third taking out a loan to pay for food and heating.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/6">I looked at the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust work that has been undertaken by the Centre for Research in Social Policy, which demonstrated how the basic income from benefits has decreased in relation to the inflationary impact on basics such as food, heating and rents. I also looked at the work it had done on nutrition for expectant mothers and the concern, which was echoed some time ago by the Minister himself, about the incidence of poor maternal nutrition resulting in low birth weight.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40506" name="Charles Kennedy">The right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr Kennedy)</phrase> expressed his fear that this was, effectively, dog-whistle politics, that the poor were being used as a political football between the parties. I share those fears. I wish I did not. That was the tenor of the debate that was opened up in the budgetary statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer&#8212;the reference to curtains, and the debate that has gone on in the media about skivers and strivers. But I have more faith in the British people. I do not believe that they accept the terms of that debate. I think the British people have a sense of fairness and a sense of moral commitment to people less fortunate than themselves. That is why I do not think there is majority support for the measure. I think that, as a result of this debate, understanding is overcoming prejudice. Prejudice will be defeated by humanity; there will be an upsurge of popular support for those of us across the House who will oppose this legislation tonight and are calling for the Government to think again about the whole trajectory of their welfare cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/8">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase> has done immensely important work about interventions to tackle deprivation. There is a whole</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/9">range of them, and they are not just about income. However, his work has found that those interventions are impeded from the outset if people are struggling simply to put food on the table, heat their homes and have some kind of decent standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.108.0/10">Clause 1 is a major setback for large numbers of people right the way across our country. It undermines their standard of living and diminishes the whole of our society. It will have repercussions for a long time to come, unless we defeat it tonight.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.0/1">This has been a wide-ranging debate of nearly four hours. Although it has technically been about amendments to clause 1, the generosity of the Chair has meant that we have essentially covered the whole Bill and the issues raised by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/2">First, I want to respond to the point about the language in which the debate is constructed. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40506" name="Charles Kennedy">the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr Kennedy)</phrase> and a number of other Members said that we should avoid divisive language, and I entirely agree. I seem to recall that it was the Labour party that used the phrase &#8220;strivers&#8217; tax&#8221; about this debate&#8212;indeed, a year or so ago, the shadow Secretary of State used his party conference speech to create the very divisions that his hon. Friends are criticising. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/3">&#8220;Let&#8217;s face the tough truth&#8212;that many people on the doorstep at the last election felt that too often we were for shirkers not workers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman has form on this issue. In 2012, he was at it again. During a speech at the London School of Economics, to what I imagine was a packed house, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.110.0/5">&#8220;Labour is the party of hard workers not free-riders. The clue is in the name. We are the Labour party. The party that said that idleness is an evil. The party of workers, not shirkers.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.110.1/1">The Minister will remember that it was Sir William Beveridge who used the phrase about idleness being an evil.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.1/2">There is a difference between reporting a conversation on a doorstep in one&#8217;s constituency and using a line as the basis of a political strategy that seeks to punish those on low incomes while handing out a &#163;3 billion tax cut to Britain&#8217;s richest citizens. I am simply not sure how the Minister, as a Liberal Democrat, can support that policy.</p>

	<p pid="a.110.2/1">It is good to hear from the true heir of Beveridge. The quotes describing the Labour party that I just read out were in party conference speeches and at a conference at the LSE&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.110.4/1">It is disgraceful, as my hon. Friend says.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.4/2">The second question that has arisen is why the Bill is necessary. It has been suggested that the Bill is simply a political device, but that draws a veil over the fact that we are dealing with one of the biggest deficits in peacetime history. To listen to the Labour leadership, one would</p>
	<p pid="a.110.4/3">think that they took such matters seriously. The leader of the Labour party said on &#8220;The Andrew Marr Show&#8221;, in an interview, I think, with James Landale:</p>
	<p pid="a.110.4/4">&#8220;So when it comes to the next Labour government, if I was saying to you, &#8216;I can absolutely promise to restore this cut or that cut&#8217;, you would say &#8216;Well, where is the money going to come for that?&#8217;...We are absolutely determined that Labour shows we would be fiscally credible in government.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.110.4/5">We have not heard a lot of that today. The shadow Chancellor has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.110.4/6">&#8220;The public want to know that we are going to be ruthless and disciplined in how we go about public spending&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.4/7">In fact, we have heard speech after speech calling for the Bill to be scrapped but there has not been a hope of hearing where the money would come from.</p>
	<p pid="a.110.4/8">The Bill and related measures save &#163;3.6 billion. When I challenged the shadow Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>, about where that money would come from, he said&#8212;I paraphrase&#8212;&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t start from here.&#8221; I am afraid that the Opposition have to do rather better than that.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.2/2">A number of my hon. Friends asked perfectly reasonably about why we needed to set out in legislation exactly where we were going. We all want our constituents to continue to enjoy, for example, the low mortgage rates that are absolutely crucial to their standard of living. We all know that for those of our constituents in the position of owning their own homes, the mortgage is their biggest single outgoing by a long way. It is vital, therefore, that we keep interest rates under control.</p>

	<p pid="a.111.4/1">But that is kind of the point&#8212;not at the moment it&#8217;s not, because we have kept interest rates under control.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/2">Why is that necessary? Let me share what the International Monetary Fund&#8217;s &#8220;World Economic Outlook&#8221; said as recently as October 2012:</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/3">&#8220;To anchor market expectations, policymakers need to specify adequately detailed medium-term plans for lowering debt ratios, which must be backed by binding legislation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/4">That is the important point. Were we to go year by year, seeing how it went, we would not have the credibility of deficit reduction to which all of us who signed up to the coalition agreement are committed.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/5">Likewise, the OECD&#8217;s economic outlook said:</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/6">&#8220;The government&#8217;s fiscal policy stance and strong institutions have secured the confidence of financial markets, as evidenced by the near record-low government bond yields.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/7">In other words, this is for a purpose&#8212;the purpose of tackling the vast, sprawling deficit. To give a sense of scale, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40046" name="Alan Reid">the Member for Argyll and Bute (Mr Reid)</phrase> was absolutely right when he said that in the final year of the previous Labour Government, for</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/8">every &#163;3 raised in tax, &#163;4 was spent. What did that add up to? We are talking about a Bill and related measures that will eventually save about &#163;3 billion a year. Labour was borrowing &#163;3 billion a week, so we would need, say, 50 of these Bills to tackle just one year of Labour borrowing. That is the scale of the situation. When Labour Members airily take the moral high ground and pretend that there is a free lunch to be had&#8212;that we do not have to do this or make all the other cuts, but that somehow the deficit will disappear&#8212;we need to remind people that these are Labour cuts tackling Labour&#8217;s deficit.</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/9">People should not just take my word for it regarding the need to include social security as part of deficit reduction. Clearly, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> said, this is not comfortable stuff, and it is not something that any of us take any pleasure in. However, the IFS has said this about why social security is part of the mix:</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/10">&#8220;When cutting public spending dramatically to help reduce an unsustainable budget deficit&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/11">that is the IFS&#8217;s language, not mine&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.111.4/12">&#8220;it is almost inevitable that spending on benefits and tax credits&#8212;which account for 30% of the government&#8217;s total budget&#8212;will be targeted.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.112.1/2">We have a target for 2015-16 of &#163;10 billion of spending reductions. We have not yet found that &#163;10 billion. Even with this Bill, we are on about &#163;6 billion, and without the Bill and related measures we would be down to about &#163;3 billion. The challenge for Opposition Members who have said that taking money away from benefits takes spending power out of the economy is that so do other forms of spending cuts. If the money comes not from benefits but from local government, that will be money out of the local economy; if it comes from infrastructure projects, that will be money out of the local economy. There is not a free way of finding money without any impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.112.1/3">Let me deal first with amendment 12, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40279" name="Richard Graham">the right hon. Member for East Ham. My hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)</phrase> put it very well when he said of Labour that there is a vacuum where there should be a policy. That is a metaphor for the Labour party. In relation to a Bill that says that benefits and tax credits should go up by 1%, the amendment would take out the figure of 1%, so what would be left? Presumably, &#8220;Benefits should go up&#8221; but by how much? Perhaps by a fraction of 1%&#8212;we do not know. The amendment is incoherent; it would take something out and put nothing in its place. It would remove the heart of the Bill but gives no guidelines on whether the figure should be below inflation or above inflation, below earnings or above earnings.</p>

	<p pid="a.113.9/1">Let me respond a little further. The hon. Lady said that we should choose RPI because, essentially, it is bigger on average. The point about correcting benefits for inflation is not just to find the biggest number possible, but to measure inflation properly and correct benefits accordingly. We could also have a separate debate about the adequacy of benefits, but to use a flawed inflation measure that even the Office for National Statistics, which constructs it, says does not meet international standards, is a crazy direction to take, even if the hon. Lady did not need to find &#163;2.5 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.0/1">If it were trivial to raise &#163;100 billion from the filthy rich, I suspect that most Governments would have been there by now.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/2">The most credible, coherent amendment in this group is amendment 10, which was moved by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" name="Andrew George">the Member for St Ives (Andrew George)</phrase>. He was so nice about me that I was almost tempted to accept the amendment, but not quite. Let me explain the reasons why not.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/3">The first relates to the specifics of the amendment, which links benefit increases in 2014-15 and 2015-16 to whatever amount average earnings grow by. Based on the forecasts&#8212;I accept that that is what they are&#8212;that would mean an above inflation increase in the second of those two years, because we think that average earnings in a couple of years&#8217; time will be more than CPI, as is the case in many normal years. At a time when we all agree that money will be tight, my hon. Friend is suggesting that an above inflation benefit increase in the second of those two years should be a priority. I do not think that it should be. At a time when we will have to make other difficult decisions about saving, the first consequence of his amendment&#8212;I do not imagine that he meant this&#8212;would be to lock in what we expect to be an above inflation increase in benefits in 2015-16. I do not believe that that will be our priority at that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/4">Had we been in Committee upstairs and the Bill had further stages to go through, my hon. Friend may well have said that this was a probing amendment and we could have had a chat about it, but if we were to agree to the amendment tonight it would become part of the Bill that will go to the other place. It is a serious amendment that would have an unintended consequence.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/5">Secondly, this is not intended as a wrecking amendment, but it would have that effect. We estimate that it would wipe out virtually all the Bill&#8217;s savings. Although I understand that my hon. Friend shares my concern about the impact on people on low incomes, that money would have to be found somewhere else. I do not believe that there is a painless way of finding that money or that the social security budget would be exempted from finding it.</p>
	<p pid="a.114.0/6">We have already had to do some very difficult things on welfare spending in the Parliament whereby we have targeted particular benefits and identified particular issues, and a relatively small number of people have faced large cash losses. This is a different approach. It is a gradual approach that will create much smaller losses, but for much larger numbers of people. At a time when we are trying to find savings from this budget, I believe that spreading the pain relatively thinly across a larger group, rather than focusing on a smaller one, is the way to go.</p>

	<p pid="a.114.1/1">Leaving aside the wisdom or otherwise of committing ourselves to the Government&#8217;s proposed up-rating level of 1% for 2015-16, my hon. Friend is right, according to the Government&#8217;s figures, that there is a funding gap of about &#163;2.5 billion for 2015-16. He has to accept, however, that two fifths of cash benefits go to those with above-average incomes. Indeed, a</p>
	<p pid="a.114.1/2">former constituent of mine has said how laughable it is that he now lives in Greece yet still receives a winter fuel allowance. Surely we can find savings that are less painful than those proposed.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.0/1">I can tell my hon. Friend that we have his ex-constituent in Greece in our sights. All I can say is that I hope he enjoyed his last payment. Joking aside, even if we took away all winter fuel payments to overseas pensioners, we would be talking about tens of millions of pounds, not savings on the scale that we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.115.0/2">I want to say something a bit more positive to my hon. Friend. The gist of his amendment is that he believes that fairness demands that benefits go up in line with earnings. The Bill will deliver that for him over what I believe is not an arbitrary period but a sensible, realistic one. He knows that over the five years since it became difficult to find money for things&#8212;the credit crunch and financial crisis of 2008&#8212;we have put benefits up by 20%, including 5.2% last year, when inflation was very high. With three years of uprating at 1%, we would be on something like 23%. Wages have gone up by 10% or so over that period, and I would wager that on any credible estimate of wage inflation, benefits will have gone up at least as fast as earnings over the whole eight-year period, if not faster. Over a tempestuous period for the economy and the welfare state, we will have ensured that benefits rise at least as fast as earnings, which is a record to be proud of. The Bill will deliver what his amendment asks for&#8212;benefits rising in line with earnings overall.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.1/1">As my hon. Friend has said, the Government have made a difficult decision to deal with the matter in the least unfair way. What has not been said in the debate is that the 1% uprating will not apply to all out-of-work or in-work benefits. Certain particularly vulnerable groups have been deliberately excluded. I hope he will reiterate that.</p>

	<p pid="a.115.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right to remind the Committee of that. We have made our commitment to the triple lock on the state pension, which means that it will rise by an amount above inflation this April. We have passed cash on to the guarantee credit to ensure that the poorest pensioners get the full increase, protected the key disability benefits&#8212;disability living allowance and attendance allowance&#8212;and ensured that the support component of employment and support allowance is protected. We can be proud of achieving all those things despite the difficult financial situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for mentioning the position of low-paid workers. People on the minimum wage were mentioned in the debate, and we will have halved the tax bill of someone on the minimum wage. That is a real contribution to their standard of living.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/2">I say to my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives that we cannot find the savings that we need by excluding the social security budget from them. The two biggest things that the Government spend money on are public sector pay, which has already been the subject of a separate measure, and social security benefits. The two together account for a vast swathe of public spending. When we need savings, we cannot ring-fence social security. What we can do, however, is try to do things gradually.</p>
	<p pid="a.116.0/3">I want to explain why some of the figures for people&#8217;s losses that have been quoted are far greater than is truly the case. My hon. Friend mentioned someone who is in and out of work, and the typical time on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance is three months. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> asked me to give some examples of cash figures. We are talking about an uprating of perhaps 80p a week or so below inflation in one year, so maybe &#163;2.50 a week below inflation over a three-year period. For a typical person who is out of work for three months, which is the median spell on JSA, the difference will therefore be a tenner a month, or &#163;30 to &#163;40 over that three-month period. That &#163;40 is a lot of money to someone who is unemployed, but the typical experience is that someone has three months of unemployment and then finds a job. We are about to cut people&#8217;s income tax bills by &#163;600 a year, so that person might have, say, &#163;3 a week less while unemployed, but the typical experience is for them to be unemployed for a relatively short period and then get a job, so they will benefit from all our other measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.116.2/2">There has been much discussion about percentages during the debate. Several Members have said that a small percentage of not very much is not very much&#8212;I think their argument was that the answer was a slightly bigger percentage of not very much. However, even a small percentage of a &#163;200 billion bill for tax credits, pensions and benefits is a vast sum of money, which is why we have to take the difficult decisions we are talking about.</p>

	<p pid="a.117.0/1">It is, I suppose, possible that had Labour won the last election the eurozone crisis might never have happened, and I grant it is possible that world commodity prices might not have gone up. It is possible that all sorts of things might have happened, but in the real world we live in a global economy. Of course things have been more difficult than we expected. That is why we must tackle the situation, not just borrow more money.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/2">Let me offer my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives further reassurance about what will happens if inflation rises&#8212;an important issue raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute. Our right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change is actively seeking to ensure, for example, that low-income constituents get the best energy tariff they can, rather than what they currently pay. Evidence shows that the people most likely to shop around, switch and be online are not on the whole the most vulnerable customers, so we are ensuring that the most vulnerable customers, who may not take advantage of those lower tariffs, get access to them. I believe that will make a real difference.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/3">More broadly, my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives asks what would happen if inflation ran away, but the Government would not sit idly by and watch&#8212;we have various measures available to us to respond to that. The OBR&#8217;s forecast for CPI is lower for 2015 than it is now. It is, of course, a forecast, but we will not simply let inflation rip. If we do not commit now to firm targets on where we are going, the OBR will not sign them off, they will not appear in our spending plans and the market will not believe us. If the market does not believe us, interest rates will go up as will the mortgages of our constituents who will have less spending power&#8212;where?&#8212;in the local economy, which is exactly where everybody has said they want to see demand. There is a knock-on effect from all those things, and the failure of the Labour party to suggest an alternative is shocking.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/4">Let me respond to one or two other points raised during the debate. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40268" name="Ian Mearns">The hon. Member for Gateshead (Ian Mearns)</phrase> made a point about percentages being meaningless, but as I have said, from a &#163;200 billion budget those percentages make a great deal of difference. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham made some powerful points. He said that we need to keep inflation down&#8212;I have given some examples of how we want to do that&#8212;and mentioned the need to get jobs going, which we agree with.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/5">The Labour party seems to be saying that if we adopt its policies, somehow the jobs would flow, but what have we heard about that today? Funnily enough, we have heard almost nothing about the whizzo scheme that was so good when Labour tried it in office as a pilot that they never actually saw it through. Somehow it is supposed to find &#163;3.5 billion of savings, but that is fantasy land. It was a fig leaf rushed out over Christmas so that Labour had something to say because it realised it was on the wrong side of the argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/6">There has been some discussion of child poverty and it is important to address that issue in the final few minutes of the debate. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said that when looking at a Government&#8217;s impact on child poverty, we should look at their policies in the round. Clearly, the single biggest thing that we will do to tackle child poverty is the universal credit introduced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/7">and Pensions. That is designed to make work pay and to take children and adults out of poverty. As soon as we are able to bring it in&#8212;starting later this year, which is a great achievement&#8212;we will start to see its impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/8">I was asked for predictions about child poverty, but let me point out the paradox that we have published a set of figures that relate to this Government. Those figures show not a rise in child poverty but a fall of 300,000 according to the measure of child poverty that is the key target of the Child Poverty Act 2010. We have not gone round television studios saying, &#8220;Aren&#8217;t we great, we&#8217;ve got child poverty down?&#8221;, because the main reason child poverty fell was a recession that meant average incomes fell. It would have been absurd for us to trumpet a triumph on child poverty when children were apparently lifted out of poverty because incomes had fallen. That is perverse.</p>
	<p pid="a.117.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" name="Helen Goodman">The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase> asked what the figures will be at the end of the Parliament. For a start, there has been a 300,000 improvement, for which we will not claim any credit, and the universal credit policy will help. Of course, taking money off benefits moves things in the other direction, but overall we are moving things in the right direction, not the wrong one.</p>

	<p pid="a.118.0/1">As the Minister knows very well, my question was this: what are his figures on absolute poverty?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-01-21a.118.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" speakername="Steve Webb" colnum="118"  time="020:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130121/debtext/130121-0003.htm#13012136001315">
	<p pid="a.118.1/1">The hon. Lady will know perfectly well that the Labour Government never forecast poverty rates. She was a Work and Pensions Minister with&#8212;if I remember rightly&#8212;responsibility for child poverty, and never once forecast poverty rates, but in opposition she suddenly believes that this Government should do so. We will publish the annual figures that show the effects of all our policies and the state of the economy. That is what the public want to see.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.1/2">Another question that resonates with my hon. Friends in the Liberal Democrats is why are we taking money off poor people and giving it to rich people? That is a summary of what was said. I worked for the IFS for nine years and have the highest regard for it, but, to be clear, when the IFS does its numbers, it does not count almost all the taxes on the rich we have introduced&#8212;it cannot, because it uses household surveys, to which the rich do not, on the whole, reply at all, partly because they are too busy salting their money away in Swiss bank accounts. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Not any more they won&#8217;t &#8212;we have tackled Swiss bank accounts to the tune of several billion pounds. We have increased the main rate of capital gains tax to 28%, which is a substantial increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.1/3">The Labour party focuses on the wages of millionaires as if millionaires are those who earn a &#163;1 million wage. However, millionaires on the whole are folk who have capital gains and properties. They pay stamp duty. They try to avoid paying tax, but we have been cracking down on that, and there is a further clampdown on pension tax relief. The vast majority of those gains for the Government are not counted in the IFS figures. The overall impact is that we are taking far more from the rich than Labour ever would have done. I can therefore assure my right hon. and hon. Friends that this is not a question of taking money from the poor when we could take it from the rich. Even the Budget that reduced the</p>
	<p pid="a.118.1/4">higher rate of tax from 50% to 45% raised many times more in other measures. As we have heard during the course of the debate, the 45p rate, which Opposition Members tell us they find morally repugnant, is 5% more than the Labour Government levied in 13 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.1/5">Amendment 12 would create a vacuum instead of a policy. It would give us no credibility in the financial markets and drive up interest rates when we want to keep them low. Amendment 7 would reinstate the RPI, which even the official statistician says is not up to international standards, and cost &#163;2.5 billion a year compared with the Government&#8217;s plans. I have no doubt that amendment 10, in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for St Ives, is well-intended, but unfortunately it would tie the Government in to an above-inflation increase in 2015-16. The Liberal Democrats would not choose that as a priority, but I can assure him that the Bill, on top of the decisions the Government have made to prioritise the poor, will mean that benefits will rise in line with earnings over the period since the financial crisis. My hon. Friend wants that through his amendment, and that is what we will deliver through the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.118.1/6">I therefore urge the Committee to reject the amendments and support the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.127.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wonder whether consideration could be given to how our business could be organised better, so that legitimate amendments could be put to a vote rather than being talked out. My amendment was supported by at least four parties, and the amendment of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40572" name="Andrew George">the hon. Member for St Ives (Andrew George)</phrase> would no doubt have received significant support as well, but there was no time for that happen. I think that it would be a worrying precedent if the only amendments put to a vote were those tabled by members of the official Opposition.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.0/1">I understand the hon. Lady&#8217;s frustration, but the amount of time given was agreed by the House on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-08">8 January</phrase>, and unfortunately the time allowed today has been squeezed on that basis. We are now eating into Third Reading time, which we would have lost completely had more Divisions been allowed.</p>

Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase> has pointed out, there is some disappointment among those who wished to test the temperature of the Committee. We were readily allowed to engage in the two-dimensional tribalism represented by previous Divisions, but we had no opportunity to ensure that the more nuanced and considered debate on other issues was brought to a proper conclusion, because those who wished to express a view had no opportunity to do so in the Lobbies.</p>

	<p pid="a.128.2/1">That was, in fact, the same point of order. Again, I understand the frustration that is felt, but&#8212;quite rightly&#8212;it is not for the Chair to decide the amount of time that is allocated for a debate. It is for the House to make that decision, and it did so on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-08">8 January</phrase>. No doubt the hon.

	<p pid="a.128.3/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">The Bill moves into its Third Reading with&#8212;I believe&#8212;its fundamental principles intact. I thought that my hon. Friend the Minister of State&#8217;s closing speech before the votes answered, in detail, many of the questions that remained after the debate on the amendments, but now, on Third Reading, I think it important to make further progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/3">The arguments that we advanced when we presented the Bill were first and foremost about affordability. Our main argument concerned the need to reduce the historic deficit left by Labour. As I have said to my colleagues throughout the coalition, at no stage have we made our decisions lightly. This is not something that, at the start, we would have wanted to do, and I want to come back to that point in a moment. We were left a legacy of disaster and spending that was out of control, and our priority must be to get that back under control. If we do not do that, the poorest in society will fare the worst&#8212;that is the main point to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/4">Let me give an illustration of the point I was making. Under the previous Government public spending ran to excess, while the cost of working age welfare increased by some 60% in real terms, as has been said on a number of occasions. Money was poured into what became an over-inflated system; as my hon. Friend the Minister of State, has said, for every &#163;3 taken in tax &#163;4 was actually borrowed, with the result that we had a growing deficit. It was one of the worst deficits in Europe, if not the worst in the western world. We spent &#163;170 billion on tax credits alone between 2003 and 2010. For all the talk about this being absolutely about people in work, 70% of that money went on child tax</p>
	<p pid="a.128.3/5">credits, chasing a target that Labour never hit, and that was payable regardless of whether parents were in work or not.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.1/1">No, I am going to make a little progress now, although I will give way later. I recognise that some who did not get a chance to speak earlier may wish to say a few words, and I want to give them a little time to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.1/2">The previous Government appeared to have no care or concern for the fact that more than &#163;10 billion was wasted and lost eventually through fraud, error and overpayments, nor that the rest of the money altogether failed to meet its aim. There was already a problem with fraud and error on tax credits, but, worse still, the previous Government did not even record overpayments, so we have no idea to what degree that system was damaged. However, we do know&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.129.3/1">I said that I would make a little progress and then give way. I wish to make one point, which is that &#163;4 billion has had to be written off as a direct result of this inability to get the money back, with a further &#163;4 billion likely to be written off directly as a result of Labour&#8217;s massive failure to control that budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.3/2">The second part of our approach is important and it relates to the issue of fairness, which my hon. Friend the Minister of State addressed. We do not do these things lightly, but we do want to make sure that those paying the tax bill for those receiving it in welfare recognise that their taxes are well spent; we want to ensure that those in work paying their taxes do not see the rises for those on welfare outstripping their own. We have already discussed the increases, so this is fundamentally an issue of fairness.</p>

	<p pid="a.129.7/1">Over the past month or two, as the Secretary of State has warmed up the debate for tonight&#8217;s Bill, he has launched attack after attack on tax credits. Will he just accept the principle that tax credits are important in helping to make sure that people are better off in work and, indeed, that that is why he is not abolishing tax credits but incorporating them into the new system of universal credit? Will he just set that point straight for the House?</p>

	<p pid="a.129.8/1">I have said all along that I do not doubt that at the beginning the intention was to try to improve the lot of those working on low incomes; I have never attacked that as a principle. The point I am making tonight is that there seemed to be a loss of control. In 2005, the then Government stuck a 58% increase into tax credits just before an election&#8212;almost 70% of</p>
	<p pid="a.129.8/2">all the money in tax credits goes on child tax credits&#8212;and they were, in a way, bribing an electorate in the hope that these people would vote for them because they felt that there would be some reason why they would not get the money afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="a.129.8/3">I wish to make one important point to the right hon. Gentleman on tax credits, because he has asked me about them. The reality was that the previous Government ended up, through tax credits and child tax credits, attempting to chase a target that, as the economy improved, ran away from them. This became spending for an arbitrary target, and the taxpayer was chasing a target that the previous Government never achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.130.5/1">Let me put the figures in the round within the period of spending review. My hon. Friend the Minister of State made a very good point, with which I agree and which I have made in the past&#8212;we do not trumpet our progress because we think the process of setting a target around 60% of the median income line was a recipe for nightmare problems and excess spending. We do not claim that that is the right way to measure the problem. The hon. Lady will have noticed that in answer to a parliamentary question last week, we said that we will go into full public consultation about a better way to measure real child poverty that the coalition Government will set and measure ourselves against&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Income will be part of it, but not the dominant part that her Government made it. If she and her party were honest&#8212;when I made this point on Second Reading, I noticed one of her Front Benchers nodding his head&#8212;they would admit that when they worked out the arbitrary target in 1997-98, they thought that they would not be in power that long and that they could achieve the targets along the way. What they ended up in doing was create a nightmare for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.130.5/2">Some &#163;170 billion were spent on tax credits but targets to halve child poverty by 2010 were missed by 600,000. Easier successes were found and then later the rate fell from 26% to 23%. It dropped further between 2002 and 2005 but that coincided with a 75% increase in spending on tax credits from &#163;13.2 billion to &#163;22.9 billion. Throughout that period, the amount of severe child poverty was absolutely static.</p>

	<p pid="a.131.0/1">The Secretary of State knows that the Liberal Democrats are not comfortable about this sort of Bill, but my hon. Friend the Minister of State argued that, in difficult circumstances, we must take difficult measures. Will the Secretary of State reaffirm the Government&#8217;s commitment to taking children out of poverty, to the basic principles of the welfare state and to go on seeking to ensure that all those who cannot work through no fault of their own&#8212;carers, unemployed people and pensioners&#8212;will continue to be supported?

Friend the Minister of State and I have worked to ensure that what we do to get the deficit down through universal credit and the other reforms&#8212;even those for pensions&#8212;will improve the lot of the poorest in society. If we take the figures on that relative income point across the period covered by the spending review, we can see that some 350,000 children net will be lifted out of poverty, even if we take into account the effect of this Bill. I can tell my right hon. Friend that that is absolutely our purpose and one that I believe we can stand by.</p>

They have voted against every single measure to reform and reduce the overall spending on welfare so that we can get the deficit under control. Let me quote somebody whom they might remember. The quote is this:</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/3">&#8220;from 2005 onwards Labour was insufficiently vigorous in limiting or eliminating the potential structural deficit.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.131.5/4">That was their former Prime Minister, Tony Blair. I agree with him. In 2005 the previous Government raised spending dramatically as a device for electoral success, as we said earlier. Time and again Labour has voted against our reforms.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.0/1">Before I give way, let me give some examples. The Opposition opposed the Welfare Reform Bill, and that would have cost &#163;2.1 billion in extra spending. They rejected the benefit cap&#8212;a further &#163;500,000. Reversing tax credit savings would cost &#163;5.5 billion. Reversing the child benefit savings would cost &#163;1.7 billion. Voting against this Bill would cost another &#163;1.9 billion. That money would need to come from somewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.0/2">If I give way to the right hon. Gentleman now, I would like to hear him tell us how exactly he would reduce the overall spending. Please, nothing on the bankers bonus tax, which has been spent at least 10 times already. If he tells us that he would get long-term unemployed people back to work, he should remember that under his Government the long-term unemployed figures doubled.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.1/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for giving way. We have said that contributory employment and support allowance should be limited to two years. We have said that there should be an independent gateway for disability living allowance. We have said that we should switch the way we uprate benefits from RPI to CPI. We have said that there should be a benefit cap which, yes, is different in London from the rest of the country, but a benefit cap none the less. We have said that disregards in tax credits should be reduced. Crucially, we have said that there should be a two-year limit on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance. That is a far bigger list than the current Chancellor of the Exchequer ever set out when he was in opposition. We think welfare spending should come down. We think getting people back into work is the way to do it. That is why we think the Secretary of State should have brought forward plans to sort out the Work programme, which is failing, and to fix universal credit, which is in disarray.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.2/1">I wonder why I bothered to give way to the right hon. Gentleman. Every one of those statements was a spending commitment. They were not reductions. Every one of them would still leave a Labour Government with a vast bill to pay. I remind the Opposition that what they have opposed remains the reality. They are stacking up spending commitments without one single observation about how they would make the savings necessary to cut the deficit that they left us&#8212;one of the worst deficits, as I said before. Their proposed raid on pensions, which they wanted to talk about, would not cover it. They have already spent several times over all their little gimmicks. Voting against the Bill is another spending commitment.</p>

	<p pid="a.132.4/1">I will give way to the hon. Gentleman, but first I want to deal with some of the claims that the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill made in the course of the debates on the Bill. The first claim that he made was that spending on out-of-work benefits was falling before 2010. That is not true. The figures published show that between 1997-98 and 2010-11 spending on out-of-work benefits rose by &#163;2.6 billion. There we have it. Even the Opposition&#8217;s attempt to whitewash what was a very small idea is not true. Overall benefits and tax credit spending increased by &#163;75 billion, from &#163;122 billion to &#163;197 billion, which is 60% in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.132.4/2">The Opposition&#8217;s decision to vote against the Bill has financial implications equivalent to 48,000 nurses&#8217; salaries or more than 500,000 primary school places. That is the kind of mess that they have got themselves into because they have taken the easy course in opposition, which is to oppose everything and to come up with no serious proposals.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.0/1">In York there is a particularly large gap between private sector rents and the levels of housing benefit because the broad rental market area for York includes a number of towns 20 miles away, such as Malton, Norton and Easingwold, where rents are about 40% lower. A new clause was tabled that suggested that the Department should analyse those gaps on an annual basis, but there was not time to discuss it. How would the Secretary of State respond to that proposal? Would he support such a proposal if it were made in another place?</p>

	<p pid="a.133.1/1">We are always analysing what we are doing with local housing allowance and housing benefit generally, so that is an ongoing process for us. We are also testing our proposals for universal credit when it comes to housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/2">I know that I need to conclude, but I want to say something, as the hon. Gentleman touches on the subject. When we brought in the housing benefit changes, we heard all sorts of threats that those would lead to total disaster. One of the myths propagated by the Opposition was that 82,000 people across London would lose their homes. The reality is, so far, that the figure is up by just under 600. The myth was that 134,000 people would have to move or become homeless. The reality is that across the country, the numbers of those in temporary accommodation is up by only about 900.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/3">In conclusion, the changes that we are putting forward are down to the first point that I made, the second point being that we need to carry them out in the fairest possible way. As my hon. Friend the Minister said earlier, we do not take this course of action lightly, but we know that if we were to go on borrowing at the rate that the last Government would have, we would punish the poorest.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.1/4">I say to the Opposition that it is not good enough simply to take the easy course. When in government, they left us with the worst deficit and high borrowing that would have completely devastated those who pay their mortgages. They need to come to the Dispatch Box and tell us now how they would be fair to those who have to pay the highest tax bills.</p>

	<p pid="a.133.2/1">I rise to oppose Third Reading. I have not been in the House for as long as the Secretary of State, but never in my years here have I seen so much taken from so many so fast. It is a disgrace that the Government should have rammed the Bill through the House in just two weeks. I hope that the other place will have listened hard to our debates today and seen how little time has been granted to us in the Commons to debate measures that will hurt thousands and thousands of our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/2">In the fortnight since the Bill was introduced, claim after claim made by the Government has simply fallen apart. Originally, we were told that the Bill would not hurt working people, that the Government would protect</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/3">disabled people, and that they cared about &#8220;family-raisers&#8221;, to use the Prime Minister&#8217;s term, yet in vote after vote tonight the Government have refused to stand by their word. They have refused to protect working people or to offer safeguards for disabled people, and we have heard nothing remotely credible from them about how child poverty will be tackled. After tonight&#8217;s debate, no one will believe that there is such a thing as compassionate conservatism. To be frank, it was always a wild claim and, lo and behold, so it has turned out.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/4">When the Bill was first presented to us, we were invited to believe that it was squarely aimed at those of our neighbours who were &#8220;sleeping off a life on benefits&#8221;, in supposed contrast with a Budget that allegedly helped working people and gave effect to the Prime Minister&#8217;s determination, expressed to the party faithful&#8212;their number is dwindling&#8212;at his party&#8217;s conference. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/5">&#8220;They call us the party of the better-off&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/6">That is true; we do. He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/7">&#8220;no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.133.2/8">How does the Bill help those who are striving to be better off? The Institute for Fiscal Studies could not have been blunter: 7 million working people will be hurt by the Bill. The impact of changes announced in the autumn statement will be, between now and April 2015, to reduce the real income of the one-earner working family by &#163;534 on average, net of any increase in the personal allowance. That is why this is a strivers&#8217; tax, pure and simple, which we will oppose.</p>

	<p pid="a.134.3/1">No. Given the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s support for a programme motion that has given me six minutes to respond to a Bill that takes hundreds of pounds off thousands of his constituents, he will forgive me for carrying on.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/2">Some 206,000 disabled people will be &#163;62 a year worse off as a result of this Bill. The Government have been caught red-handed trying to keep the truth from this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/3">I am glad that today we have had an extensive debate on child poverty, because we were told nothing about how many children and how many working parents would be hurt by this Bill. Only in the past couple of weeks has the truth finally emerged. I want to put on record Labour Members&#8217; gratitude to the Child Poverty Action Group for ruthlessly exposing the impact of the Bill and the cumulative impact of other measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/4">The Secretary of State spent some time casting doubt on the strategy for tackling child poverty, which I seem to remember he voted for when he supported the Child Poverty Act 2010. On <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-24">24 November 2004</phrase>, the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/5">&#8220;I believe that poverty is an economic waste and a moral disgrace. In the past, we used to think of poverty only in absolute terms&#8230; That&#8217;s not enough. We need to think of poverty in relative terms.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/6">The Chancellor was even blunter when he said to the <i>News of the World</i>: &#8220;We&#8217;re all in this together. I&#8217;m not going to balance the Budget on the backs of the poor.&#8221; That encouraged the Secretary of State to wade in on &#8220;Sky News&#8221; in June 2010, when he said that &#8220;you have&#8221; to make savings</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/7">&#8220;but protect the poorest and that&#8217;s my absolute priority.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/8">How hollow those words ring tonight.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/9">The truth is now before us: 200,000 children will be pushed into poverty as a result of this Bill. According to the Child Poverty Action Group, the measures in this Bill, alongside other measures that have been introduced, mean that 1 million children will be pushed into poverty by this Government. That will be the Secretary of State&#8217;s legacy. He spent all those years trying to persuade us that the Conservative party was finally a party that cared about poverty, and now, because the Chancellor needed a new year&#8217;s dividing line on welfare, he is accountable for putting 1 million children into poverty. It is well and truly clear that the nasty party is back.</p>
	<p pid="a.134.3/10">This is about not just children but their mothers. A fortnight ago, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40646" name="Tom Watson">the Member for West Bromwich East (Mr Watson)</phrase> published a list of 106 battle- ground constituencies. In those seats, there are 150,000 mothers who will be hurt by this Bill, losing &#163;180 a year. In fact, as a result of measures put through by this Government, they are now losing &#163;1,400, and tonight Members on the Treasury Bench voted to allow that to continue. They were given the chance to protect those 150,000 mothers and they chose not to. Over the next few months, we will be getting in touch with mothers in those constituencies and making it very clear that their Member of Parliament had a chance to protect their maternity pay and chose not to. Right now, the price of children&#8217;s clothing is rising by 4.5% and food prices are rising by 3.6%. Working mothers going on to statutory maternity pay are losing &#163;180 a year at a time when someone on &#163;1 million a year is getting a &#163;2,000 tax cut. How are Government Members going to justify that to people in their constituencies?</p>

	<p pid="a.136.0/1">No, there is too little time.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.0/2">It is a disgrace that this Bill is being rammed through the House tonight. The Secretary of State did not want public hearings and Ministers did not want to defend the detail of the Bill in Committee. We hope that the other place will give it the scrutiny that was denied to Members of this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.136.0/3">The tragedy is that there is another way to bring down welfare spending. Long-term unemployment is now rising towards the 1 million mark, as is youth unemployment. Nothing in this Bill fixes the Work programme, which gets only 2.6 people out of every 100 back into work, or fixes the disarray that is now unfolding in universal credit. What the Government should have been doing tonight is bringing us measures to bring down unemployment, long-term unemployment and youth unemployment, and to save this country the cost of failure. Instead, the debate on this Bill has shown a Government and Secretary of State who are hellbent on making savings and clearing up the cost of the failure of a rising unemployment bill by taking that money from working people&#8212;6,000 working people for every Conservative-held marginal constituency.</p>

	<p pid="a.141.2/1">I rise to highlight the problems of the reorganisation and funding of the East Midlands ambulance service. The problem has been covered up because, over the last 18 months, the service has lost the contract for non-emergency transfers of patients to Arriva trains and buses. Regardless of the question of service, the impact on the East Midlands ambulance service is &#163;5 million a year. That was told to me, in advance of the loss of the contract, by the senior officials who ran the service. That &#163;5 million a year has not been put back in additionally by the Government. Therefore, &#163;5 million of cuts are required in the service.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/2">To make those cuts, the service is attempting to reconfigure, which has a detrimental impact on my constituency and elsewhere, as I shall outline. Before doing so, I wish to highlight another problem for the Minister to respond to: targets and how they are set. There is currently an in-built pressure for ambulance services to meet specific targets. The reconfiguration is happening in the context of meeting those targets, but there are perverse incentives within many of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/3">I shall highlight that with one example, but there could be many. A mother sadly lost her child last year. The mother went into premature labour at 29 weeks and the child, Jessica Day, died at birth. When the mother went into premature labour, she had a midwife with her and an ambulance was called, but none was available. A response vehicle with a single paramedic came, but Jessica Day&#8217;s mother needed&#8212;medically&#8212;an immediate transfer to an intensive care unit within a hospital to give the baby, Jessica, a chance of survival. Had that immediate transfer happened, on the balance of probabilities, Jessica would be alive. It did not happen because no ambulance was available. In fact, the nearest ambulance was on its way back from Sheffield on the M1 in Yorkshire.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/4">That in itself is a major issue, but perhaps equally major is the fact that the target was met. Despite the fact that the mother with the baby needed to be in hospital immediately but did not get there for an hour and two minutes, the target was met, because a car arrived with a paramedic within 19 minutes. The mother and baby needed to be in an ambulance, and it was the right medical decision not to transfer them in their own car, which was available, as that would have endangered the mother as well. That is a graphic illustration of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/5">As we see repeatedly, not least in respect of elderly people, if the target is not met, the ambulance does not come for many hours. For example, one 80-year-old pensioner was laying in a garden for more than an hour with a broken hip. Because the immediate response target could not be met, the emergency was de-prioritised, and the ambulance was sent somewhere else to meet another target&#8212;the second incident may or may not be as urgent. The longest wait I know of for an emergency response is 10 hours, but it is often three or four hours&#8212;with &#8220;often&#8221; not meaning daily, but certainly weekly. That needs to be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/6">I also see a problem emerging with improvements. How could improvements be a problem? Over the last 11 years as an MP, I have called for a vast increase in the number of community defibrillators. I would like to see them in every community building, every significant employer, most small employers, every school and every parish council, with trained responders to use them. That would be wonderful, and a wise expenditure. All those defibrillators would be maintained by the East Midlands ambulance service, and every time one was used, it would be deemed to be an eight-minute response. Therefore there is a perverse incentive not to have community defibrillators in areas such as mine, because it would mean fewer ambulances. The community first-responder with the defibrillator would meet the response time, but the ambulance would not come in that minority of cases in which the patient needed to get to hospital. That is no good for my constituents.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/7">It is similar for strokes. I would like to see localised thrombolysing done immediately in the way it is done in Iceland, for example. The brain image is scanned and sent to the consultant, wherever they are. They analyse it instantly and the decision on thrombolysing is made. That is done without having to take people to hospital, but we are light-years away from that simple system. The reconfiguration of the ambulance service now under way will worsen that situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/8">There are bigger problems for people who do not live in a city. I want to go through some mathematics with the House to show the problems. The problem of averaging to meet targets means that, by definition, high-density cities will always be prioritised over low-density rural areas. I have a theoretical example, but it could be real in the east midlands. Suppose we have a city of 900,000 people and a rural constituency of 100,000 people. The average time for an ambulance to get to a job is much shorter in the city because of the density of population. In other words, the propensity of any square kilometre to have an incident is much higher simply because of the density of population. Therefore there will be a much higher level of vehicle cover in the city. But a 95% response time in the city and a 60% response time in the rural area&#8212;with the population figures I have given&#8212;results in a 91.5% response time overall. If those figures are reversed, with a 60% response time in the city and a 95% response time in the rural area&#8212;the exact opposite&#8212;the overall response time falls from 91.5% to 63.5%. Therefore, by definition, setting response times as they are means that ambulance services will disproportionately put their resources in the high-density cities rather than in rural areas. That is bound to happen, and the problem when the service faces a shortage of money is that when it reconfigures to meet response times, it has to downgrade the rural areas. It is not possible to do otherwise if response times alone are taken into account. The Minister needs to look at how the response times are set.</p>
	<p pid="a.141.2/9">These are major issues for the Government, and I do not make those points in a hostile, partisan way. These are issues that successive Governments have looked at, but no solution has been found. Those things have to be changed. As well as Bassetlaw hospital, we use Doncaster Royal Infirmary&#8212;we are part of the same trust. We use Sheffield hospitals for heart attacks and cancer. However, the East Midlands ambulance service plans have been reconfigured to take us to King&#8217;s Mill in Ashfield, which is an entirely different area.</p>

	<p pid="a.143.3/1">As you might imagine Mr Deputy Speaker, in Bassetlaw we had the biggest response to the consultation, with more than 19,000 people involved directly in the consultation, and we had the largest public meetings. We found one person&#8212;I will not name his political party, but he was the campaign organiser for a small party&#8212;in favour. All the other 19,000 who signed up were against it&#8212;every single person in the public meetings was against it. All the staff were against it&#8212;every single one of them. They were all against it because, if the ambulances and the base are shifted out of the area and we just have a parking lot with a portakabin, we will have an even worse second-rate, service in Bassetlaw. The averages will be maintained as the cities get our ambulances and we will not have them, and we will become the bit of the response time that is not met. My constituents will continue to die unnecessarily.</p>
	<p pid="a.143.3/2">What I want from the East Midlands ambulance service, therefore, is a proper rethink. It is clearly rethinking, but I want to ensure that Worksop and Retford ambulance stations stay open. If they want to juggle the minutiae of where the management is based, I am not worried about that and neither are my constituents, but we want two proper bases. We want the Gainsborough ambulance service maintained to keep accessibility in the north-east part, the rural part, over the border in Lincolnshire. That is what we need if we are to maintain the kind of service that my constituents expect. They pay their taxes. We have our illnesses like everybody else. What is unacceptable to all of my constituents and to me is that former mining areas and rural areas have a worse ambulance provision than the rest of the country. We are not prepared to accept that. East Midlands ambulance service must come back with a proper proposal. In that proposal, Worksop and Retford ambulance stations will need to stay open so that there is a proper base to allow the staff to continue to do their excellent job. I thank the people of Bassetlaw for the way they have responded. They will continue to do so to ensure that we get the service that they deserve.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40061" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> on securing this debate. Were it not for the fact that I now sit on the Front Bench, I would have put in for a similar debate&#8212;there is no doubt about it&#8212;such is my concern, as the constituency MP representing Broxtowe, about the situation with East Midlands ambulance service. It is important that I recognise that interest, because I, too, have had many concerns about EMAS, although they are perhaps slightly different from those the hon. Gentleman has described. As a result, I had a meeting with the chief executive of EMAS, Mr Philip Milligan, a week last Friday. I believe that he has since met the hon. Gentleman, so he will have heard about many of the issues that the hon. Gentleman raised in the House today, and rightly so.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.0/2">I do not believe that this is simply a matter of finance&#8212;that is certainly not where my concern lies&#8212;or about the &#8220;Being the Best&#8221; scheme, which has been out for consultation, as the hon. Gentleman described. My concern, and that of many other hon. Members whose constituencies are covered by EMAS, is about poor response times, notably for elderly people who have fallen. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40376" name="Nicky Morgan">the Member for Loughborough (Nicky Morgan)</phrase>, for example, has had difficulties in her constituency, and I have had half a dozen problems in mine, with frail elderly people with suspected fractures having to lie on the floor, sometimes for up to four hours, despite being less than 10 minutes from the Queen&#8217;s medical centre in Nottingham. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40542" name="Heather Wheeler">the Member for South Derbyshire (Heather Wheeler)</phrase> is nodding in agreement, as no doubt she has heard of similar experiences in her constituency. That situation is unacceptable, and I hope to offer some insight as to why that is the case.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.1/1">In South Derbyshire we have had numerous cases of elderly people falling over in a park and having to wait hours for an ambulance.

	<p pid="a.144.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her intervention, but I think that it is also important to pay tribute to the ambulance staff who work for EMAS and the outstanding work they do. It is also important to point out that between October 2010 and December 2012 EMAS recruited 65 new front-line staff, so something is going on that is not right. Many people are of the view that unfortunately it is the way that EMAS is being run that is at the heart of the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.144.3/1">I wonder whether my hon.

	<p pid="a.144.4/1">As ever, my hon. Friend makes an important point, and it is one that I will certainly look at further. I hope that those in EMAS who are listening to the debate will take that comment on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.4/2">In response to the points made by the hon. Members for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero) and for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins), I do not think that it is as simple as saying that the closure of an ambulance station will de facto reduce the service available. Ambulances do not sit in ambulance stations waiting to respond to a local incident. They spend most of their time out of ambulance stations on the road so that they can respond to emergency calls. EMAS reported&#8212;these are important facts that should be widely publicised; I am sure the hon. Member for Bassetlaw will ensure that they are&#8212;a total turnover of &#163;169.5 million in its 2011-12 final accounts and a &#163;1.4 million surplus. It has also reported surpluses in the previous three years. I understand that for 2012-13 the trust received &#163;3.5 million funding as its share of the EMAS contract from Bassetlaw primary care trust. As I have said, my concern is not so much about the money, but about the way the service is being operated.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.4/3">Let me turn to the &#8220;Being the Best&#8221; review. EMAS tells me that it recognises that its response times in rural areas do not match the response times in city centres. In response, EMAS published its &#8220;Being the Best&#8221; change programme in 2012, which outlined plans designed to ensure that response times and the service provided to all the people of the region were improved. As the hon. Member for Bassetlaw described, EMAS has consulted clinical commissioning groups, overview and scrutiny committees and local people on its proposals. As we have been told, it received substantial feedback from the people of Bassetlaw, with a petition from some 9,000 people. The business case should be presented to the board on <phrase class="date" code="2013-03-25">25 March</phrase>, allowing the trust additional time to review alternative options and develop final proposals for the board to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.144.4/4">I am told that a number of options are being considered. They include the &#8220;do nothing&#8221; option, which involves making no changes to the configuration of ambulance stations; the &#8220;do nothing&#8221;-plus option, which involves making no changes to the configuration of ambulance stations, but making an additional resource investment in more ambulance vehicles and staff; and the &#8220;do minimal&#8221; option, which involves making the minimum changes necessary to deliver current service standards in a safer and more effective manner. That option would retain all the current stations and introduce the 118 new community ambulance posts. The fourth option would establish 13 hubs, plus 118 community ambulance posts&#8212;I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40317" name="Andrew Bingham">the Member for High Peak (Andrew Bingham)</phrase>, along with many hon. Members, has expressed his concern about that option. The fifth option&#8212;a new option&#8212;would establish 27 hubs, plus 108 community ambulance posts, and is being considered as a direct result of the consultation feedback.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.0/1">Does my hon. Friend think, like me, that although the hub and spoke model has merit, the key is where the hubs go? High Peak is very rural; we need a hub, as I am sure <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40061" name="John Mann">the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase> feels he does.</p>

	<p pid="a.145.1/1">That is a very good point. My hon. Friend has summed it up&#8212;we are having an outbreak of cross-party unity. As he says, the key point is the positioning of the hub. One of the attractions of the hub approach is that the mechanics would be in place to ensure that the vehicles were ready at the beginning of a</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/2">shift. At the moment, paramedics are responsible for that, which does not seem to be a very good use of their time. There is therefore much merit in establishing 27 hubs in the right areas to ensure that we have a service that is fit for purpose.</p>
	<p pid="a.145.1/3">There is something else that needs to be, not so much explored, perhaps, as exposed. The hon. Member for Bassetlaw has quite properly commented on the difficulty of having targets, and I could not agree with him more. This debate is a good example of where top-down, Government-led targets have blighted an ambulance service&#8212;no doubt there are many other examples in the NHS. That is why, when this Government were elected, for many of us it was on the basis that these targets, far from freeing up services and making them better, were strangling them and making them worse. This debate is an example of targets doing all the things they were designed not to do, constricting a service and making it worse. It is worth bearing it in mind that it was in 1997, I believe, that the ambulance service suffered from such targets. I hope that there will be more cross-party agreement and moving forward, so that although there are laudable aims that all services should have, we should not necessarily set rigid targets, which then create exactly the sort of horribly sad cases that the hon. Gentleman told us about.</p>

I think there is a case for re-examining targets, and I hope he would join me in saying to the ambulance service, &#8220;Let&#8217;s look again at these targets in the NHS to see whether they&#8217;re doing the job we want them to do,&#8221; because it is precisely because of these targets that elderly people in my constituency have been lying on floors for up to four hours while ambulances have to go to meet a target.</p>

Members that I explored this matter with Mr Milligan, and an elderly lady lying on the floor with a suspected fractured hip does not fall into the category of an emergency life-threatening situation. These are not definitions imposed by this Government; these are the consequences of the 13 years of the previous Administration. I take the view that the situation needs urgent review, and I will certainly be making that recommendation in the Department that we need to look again at the ambulance service.</p>

In my area of Bolsover and mid-Derbyshire, it seemed as though the 17 control centres were going to be reduced to two. I get the impression that the Minister is saying that most of the 27 would be likely to remain.

Gentleman&#8217;s important point about the former coal-mining communities &#8212;they are similar to my own, although mine is not on the same scale as Bolsover. I make the point again, however, to be fair to EMAS, that the reason it has gone through this process&#8212;which has been painful for many people&#8212;is precisely because it wants to improve its service.
