	<p pid="a.1055.1/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that answer. We are here because Lord Justice Leveson said that he wanted a new voluntary code from the press that had statutory underpinning. The press have come forward with a new draft code that does not have statutory underpinning and the Privy Council has come forward with a code that appears not to have press support.

	<p pid="a.1055.2/1">I will, of course, leave it to Lord Justice Leveson to speak for himself on whether he wants to contribute further to the debate, but I can say clearly to my hon. Friend that the essence of the Leveson report was self-regulation. I believe that we now have a way forward that will safeguard the freedom of the press and provide a good system of redress when errors are made. It is important to make the royal charter work; it is the best way to stave off the statutory regulation of the press that some are trying to impose.</p>

Will the Secretary of State accept, however, that the ability of Parliament to have a say on the rules under which the press regulator operates&#8212;even with a requirement for a two-thirds majority, which, as she knows, has no constitutional validity&#8212;allows that claim to be made? If it is that provision that is preventing some newspapers from joining, will she now, even at this late stage, consider alternative safeguards such as the one in the PressBoF charter?</p>

Given that police budgets have been cut by 20% over the same period, does the Minister accept that the hollowing out of police services has led to more perpetrators of rape and sexual violence getting away with it?

The figures from the Office for National Statistics show a 9% increase in the number of sexual offences being reported and a 9% increase in the number of rapes recorded by the police in the year to June 2013 compared with the previous year. The number of convictions has changed only marginally from earlier years, because prosecution cases that will not be successful are weeded out at an earlier stage. I have already said that we are concerned about this matter. I want to look into the precise reason why referrals have gone down and it is my intention to ensure that we get as many successful prosecutions as possible.</p>

	<p pid="a.1074.4/1">I understand the hon. Lady&#8217;s concern and I think we should all be worried about the issue, but I do not think it helps to suggest that any woman who wants to take a case will be charged &#163;1,200. That figure is only for cases that reach a hearing, which are a small proportion of the overall number. It costs much less&#8212;only &#163;250&#8212;to lodge a case in the first place. There is also a significant fee remission and costs will often be rewarded if there are problems. It is important that we do not scare off people from making claims, because we want to make sure that we crack down on rogue employers who discriminate against pregnant women.</p>

	<p pid="a.1075.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for announcing next week&#8217;s business. I also welcome him back to his place. I hope he has fully recuperated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/2">The Offender Rehabilitation Bill has finally reappeared after I raised its mysterious absence three times and after yesterday&#8217;s Opposition-day debate. Will the Leader of the House tell us whether the Government accept or intend to remove the Lords amendment to clause 1 that would require them to seek the approval of both Houses before they continue to push ahead with their reckless plans to privatise the probation service?</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/3">A report published by Age UK this week warned that 3 million elderly people are worried about whether they will be able to stay warm in their homes this winter. However, all the Government do is act as a mouthpiece for the big six energy companies, which are profiteering at everybody&#8217;s expense. It has been more than a month since we announced our plan to freeze energy prices until 2017 and all the Government do is dither. The Prime Minister says that he wants to roll back green</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/4">levies, even though he introduced 60% of them. He cannot even tell us which ones he wants to cut. Will the Leader of the House tell the Prime Minister to stop standing up for the wrong people and vote with us next week to freeze energy prices and reset this failing market?</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/5">I note that the private Member&#8217;s Bill on the EU referendum returns to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-08">8 November</phrase>. The Electoral Commission said this week that the question in the Bill risks causing a misunderstanding and it suggested a change of wording. The Leader of the House will be aware that, when the Electoral Commission recommended a change to the Scottish referendum question, the then Secretary of State for Scotland said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/6">&#8220;The UK Government has always acted on the advice of the Electoral Commission for every previous referendum.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/7">Given that the Bill was written in No. 10 and is supported by the Prime Minister, will the Leader of the House confirm that the Government will table the appropriate amendment to the referendum question in the Bill?</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/8">In January, the Prime Minister went to Davos and told the world that the UK would use its presidency of the G8 to tackle tax evasion. Last week, he could not tell my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40689" name="Seema Malhotra">the Member for Feltham and Heston (Seema Malhotra)</phrase> why he had refused to close the &#163;500 million eurobond tax loophole. On Monday, we discovered that the flagship agreement to recoup tax from UK residents who hide money in Swiss bank accounts has brought in more than &#163;2 billion less than the Chancellor scored in last year&#8217;s autumn statement. The Chair of the Public Accounts Committee says that &#163;35 billion is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the money that the Government have lost to tax scams. Why, then, have the Government appointed as head of tax policy a man who is on record as saying that &#8220;taxation is legalised extortion&#8221;? Is it any wonder that, despite the meaningless ministerial PR, the tax gap keeps on growing and Tory donors are laughing all the way to their kitchen suppers in Downing street?</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/9">The coalition agreement promised to</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/10">&#8220;put a limit on the number on Special Advisers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/11">It has just emerged that there has been a 50% rise in the last three years, costing a record &#163;7.2 million. The Deputy Prime Minister has 19 special advisers in his office alone, which is nearly 20% of the total. Does the Leader of the House agree that that is a complete waste of money? [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear!&#8221;] It seems that there is agreement across the House on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/12">The only thing that appears to be going up faster than energy prices under this Government is the cost of special advisers, which has gone up by a massive 16% this year. There are now 98 special advisers in the Government, but the more of them there are, the more incompetent the Government seem to become. This week, the Department for Work and Pensions lost its appeal in the Supreme Court on its flagship back to work scheme, the Health Secretary was humiliated in the Court of Appeal over Lewisham hospital and the Government had to slow down universal credit for the third time and apply the brakes to disability benefit changes. Yesterday, they could not even write an amendment to our Opposition motion on education that was in order. We then had the spectacle of the Minister for Schools winding up the debate on teaching robustly in support of the Government and then abstaining on the vote. Will the Leader of the House therefore make time</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/13">for a debate on the mounting evidence that this Government have abandoned all notion of collective responsibility and are descending into chaos and incoherence?</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.3/14">Today is All Hallows&#8217; eve and children across the country will be dressing up as the Deputy Prime Minister to scare their friends. I just hope that they do not do what he does&#8212;promise treats, but hand out tricks instead.</p>

	<p pid="a.1077.0/1">I am grateful to the shadow Leader of the House, not least for her kind words after my back operation. Indeed, even when I was not in the Chamber, she kindly said some nice things. I am quite pleased about this back operation; it has got me up and about and I have the picture to prove that my backbone is intact&#8212;a useful thing in this life. When I was away, the shadow Leader of the House said that she was pleased she would get to find out what the Deputy Leader of the House, who sits alongside me, was thinking. Of course, I always knew what he was thinking while I answered questions, and we now know the truth. He is thinking, &#8220;I know the answer to this one&#8221;. He demonstrated that when he did an admirable job in answering questions while I was away.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/2">The shadow Leader of the House asked a number of times about the Offender Rehabilitation Bill, which will come before the House for Second Reading. In fact, I think three Bills came from the Lords at much the same time, and the Offender Rehabilitation Bill will be the first to be debated in this House. We will consider what we need to do but, as was made clear in the other place, our intention is to press ahead with a reform that will enable a large number of offenders with a sentence of less than 12 months to secure rehabilitation for the first time, and bring down the scandalous level of reoffending among those who have been prisoners. It is important to get on with that, which is what we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/3">The shadow Leader of the House asked about energy prices, notwithstanding that my right hon. Friend the Energy Secretary will make a statement in a few minutes. The hon. Lady should reflect, however, on the apparent utter confusion on her own side during this week&#8217;s business in this House and the other place. The Leader of the Opposition stood here and said that he cares about trying to bring down energy bills, while Labour Members in the other place were voting for a decarbonisation target that would have added &#163;125 to the bill of every household. Labour Members cannot have it both ways; they cannot complain about increases in bills when the Leader of the Opposition&#8212;as Energy Secretary before the last election&#8212;wanted to increase costs through the renewable heat incentive, including a &#163;179 hit on gas bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/4">Labour cannot have it both ways, and the so-called price freeze is not a price freeze but a price con. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will demonstrate that the Government are doing what needs to be done and introducing to the market competition that did not exist when we came to office. We are getting the lowest tariffs available for customers, and doing everything we can to ensure efficiency and low costs to people, while delivering on our energy security, environmental and carbon reduction targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/5">The hon. Lady asked questions, perfectly reasonably, about the Bill for consideration on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-08">Friday 8 November</phrase>, but that is a private Member&#8217;s Bill, not a Government Bill&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I will laugh if I like. I think at the</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/6">end of the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-08">8 November</phrase>, we will be smiling, not <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40497" name="Chris Bryant">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant)</phrase>. That Bill is a matter for its promoter, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40580" name="James Wharton">the Member for Stockton South (James Wharton)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/7">It was rather an own goal by the shadow Leader of the House to talk about tax avoidance. Not only are the Government taking measures that are delivering a substantial increase in tax revenue&#8212;when compared to our predecessors&#8212;from those who would otherwise seek to avoid or evade tax, but today my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister will announce, as reflected in a written ministerial statement to the House by the Business Secretary, that we are going to proceed with a register of company beneficial ownership that will be accessible to the public. That is important not only in this country but across the world to establish who owns what, and who is therefore liable for taxation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1077.0/8">In the business that I announced, I was almost tempted to pre-empt the <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-12">12 November</phrase> Opposition-day debate; no doubt it will be on energy price freezes again, but it ought to be on the economy, as that is the issue. I have not been here for the past two weeks, but it was fascinating listening to business questions and Prime Minister&#8217;s questions. Labour Members do not want to talk about employment because we have had record employment figures. They do not want to talk about the economy because figures last Friday demonstrated that the economy is growing at a faster rate than at any time since 2008. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The supposedly silent one&#8212;the Opposition Deputy Chief Whip, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40619" name="Alan Campbell">the hon. Member for Tynemouth (Mr Campbell)</phrase>&#8212;talks about the cost of living. I would be happy to have a debate on the cost of living, because, under this Government, 25 million basic rate taxpayers will be &#163;700 better off than they were under the Labour Government; 3 million people have been taken out of income tax altogether; fuel duty is 13p per litre lower than it would have been under Labour; and there is support from the Government so that councils can freeze their taxes through the life of this Parliament, when, under the previous Labour Government, council taxes doubled. We delivered the biggest ever cash increase in the state pension last year. Those are the things the Government are doing to support people with the cost of living. We will continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1078.0/1">My right hon. Friend will recall that, some time ago, he kindly agreed to ask the chief executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority to meet me. After three and a half years of waiting, I am still very much persona non grata. The disgraceful chairman and chief executive seem to believe that smearing and slandering an individual Member of the House as hysterical&#8212;among other vulgar and untrue insults&#8212;is an acceptable modus operandi. The situation has reached an impasse. If a Member of Parliament finds that there is no direct redress or recourse in an ongoing issue with IPSA, despite numerous correspondence, e-mails and phone calls, and despite interventions from both the Leader of the House and the party&#8217;s Chief Whip, please will my right hon. Friend advise what option is left open to that Back Bencher to secure a professional and equitable conclusion from that inept, discredited and wholly unfit-for-purpose organisation?</p>

	<p pid="a.1078.1/1">Although my hon. Friend will understand if I do not comment on the points he makes on his case with IPSA, I suggested directly to the chief executive that my job could be to facilitate a meeting on a without</p>
	<p pid="a.1078.1/2">prejudice basis between him and my hon. Friend. I continue to believe that that is the right way to proceed. IPSA has important responsibilities in relation to all hon. Members, and it should be prepared to discuss and account for the way in which it discharges those responsibilities to hon. Members. I reiterate my offer to my hon. Friend and the IPSA chief executive. I am happy to facilitate and be present at a meeting at which they discuss, on a without prejudice basis, their concerns.</p>

I am a silent one in the Committee, but I listen carefully. It is a good way of understanding the views and interests of the House for debate. The Backbench Business Committee has admirably demonstrated that it is possible to schedule sittings on, effectively, a non-partisan and consensual basis, reflecting views of Members on both sides of the House. That is a very good basis on which to involve the minority parties and ensure that the views of the House as a whole are heard.

Football fans throughout England are looking forward to cheering on Roy&#8217;s boys in Brazil next year. There is no better way to do so than when enjoying a pint in the local pub, but, because of Britain&#8217;s licensing laws and the time difference, many people will be unable to watch the football and enjoy a pint at the same time. Therefore, may we have a debate on UK licensing laws and exemptions, to give some cheer to England football fans and put some money in the pockets of Britain&#8217;s publicans?</p>

	Annual Energy Statement
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-31a.1093.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40343" speakername="Edward Davey" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change"  colnum="1093"  time="011:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0002.htm#131031-0002.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.1093.1/1">Today, I am laying before the House the annual energy statement, alongside the statutory security of supply report. This coalition Government are putting in place the most coherent, sustainable energy policy the United Kingdom has ever had. We are creating one of the most competitive and attractive electricity investment markets in the world; improving our energy security and affordability; and boosting home-grown clean energy, and providing jobs and economic growth in the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/2">This ambitious energy and climate change policy is vital so that Britain can meet our significant challenges. The coalition Government inherited from the previous Administration an energy future with a huge, multi-billion pound black hole at its heart, which was the result of years of underinvestment, dithering and delay. So this Government are having to take the tough decisions others ducked to make sure that Britain&#8217;s lights do stay on. Everything we are doing has to ensure that we drive investment into the system, not scare it off or freeze it out. But, as I will make clear in this statement, energy security must go hand in hand with affordability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/3">So let me set out the robust plans we have to deliver affordable energy security. To deal with the problem of tightening electricity margins up to 2018, the Government have been working with National Grid and Ofgem to develop existing safeguards, in order to have more electricity available for the grid at peak times, including, if needed, through the use of power plants currently mothballed. We are introducing to Britain a capacity market to ensure that we attract the investment we need in new power stations. The first capacity market auction will take place next year&#8212;for delivery from the winter of 2018. In addition to those measures to keep the lights on, Britain now has a long-term strategy encapsulated in the Energy Bill. Over the summer, we published draft strike prices for renewable electricity under contracts for difference. Detailed proposals for the implementation of electricity market reform were published this month.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/4">The fruits of bringing this greater predictability and certainty to investment are already showing. Latest estimates suggest that at least &#163;35 billion has been invested in new electricity infrastructure since 2010, and much more is in the pipeline. In the past 12 months alone, we have provided consent for seven major energy infrastructure applications worth about &#163;20 billion, with the capacity to generate electricity for more than 6 million homes. That, of course, included last week&#8217;s announcement that we have reached key commercial terms with EDF for the first new nuclear power station in a generation at Hinkley Point C. And there is more: through the Energy Bill&#8217;s final investment decision enabling programme, 23 applications for 26 investment contracts are currently being evaluated by the Department of Energy and Climate Change for a broad range of renewable technologies, including onshore wind, offshore wind and biomass projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/5">Even though British households pay some of the lowest prices for gas and electricity in Europe, such facts are scant comfort to those who have seen energy prices rise considerably over the past 10 years. The main</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/6">driver of these energy price rises has been rising wholesale energy costs, not social and environmental policy. But apportioning blame is also scant comfort to people who are struggling to make ends meet. That is why we have been taking action to help people and businesses struggling with their energy bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/7">We have already introduced some help that is immediate. Two million vulnerable households will get &#163;135 off their energy bill this winter, thanks to the Government&#8217;s warm home discount. Around 12.5 million pensioners will get the winter fuel payment&#8212;&#163;200 for the under-80s and &#163;300 for those over 80. And of course there are cold weather payments if needed, which last year delivered over &#163;146 million to help cut bills for the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/8">This year we have added to these policies with more direct action. Our new big energy saving network is training 500 volunteers to go out into communities to help people get better deals from energy suppliers and reduce their energy bills. These volunteers will be fully supported. We know how much people in communities across the country rely on the post office network, so we will be working with the Post Office to raise the profile of the big energy saving network so that it can make the links with the elderly, the vulnerable and other cost-conscious families trying to make their budgets go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/9">We have also brought together in one place all the advice from across Government&#8212;from the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the Department for Work and Pensions&#8212;and from charities such as Age UK and Citizens Advice. Today, I am writing to all Members of this House with information about this new guide so that they can share it with their constituents, to make sure they are getting all the help to which they are entitled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/10">But while such immediate help for consumers and companies is important, we need more permanent change if we are to keep bills down not just for 20 months, but for 20 years and beyond. The energy company obligation is delivering such permanent change by modernising our housing stock and making it cheaper to heat our homes. Some 230,000 low income households will be warmer this winter, thanks to energy efficiency measures already installed through the ECO.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/11">Energy efficiency remains a central part of our strategy both to help the fuel poor and to deliver permanent energy savings, but the permanent energy change that we seek also needs more competitive markets. This, however, is not something that the Opposition understand, for the previous Government created the big six, and their irresponsible policies would only help the big six. In contrast, from day one, this coalition Government have been determined to take on the big six for consumers&#8212;<i>[Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The Opposition do not like it. We have been taking on the big six for consumers with the stick of competition. We have done a lot, but as I will set out, we need to do more.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/12">Already our measures to deregulate have seen a major growth in the number and size of independent energy suppliers. In 2011 there was no independent supplier with a customer base greater than 50,000. Now we have three independents with more than 100,000 customers, and a further eight companies have entered the market since May 2010. We have delivered a doubling of the number of independent energy suppliers offering competition to Labour&#8217;s big six, and already hundreds</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/13">of thousands of people are benefiting, but we are doing more. We are backing Ofgem&#8217;s reforms to help consumers get better deals&#8212;market reforms to make sure that customers are on the lowest tariffs for them, are moved off poor value dead tariffs, and no longer face the complex web of hundreds of tariffs designed more to confuse than to compete.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/14">Our reforms are ensuring that people are given clearer, more personalised information on their energy bills so that they can compare tariffs and switch more easily to save money. We are also promoting collective switching, particularly aiming to ensure that the more vulnerable get to benefit from the best deals on the market. Today, however, I am challenging the industry to deliver faster switching. If someone can change their broadband provider with a few clicks of the mouse, why should they not be able to do the same with their gas or electric? It should not take five weeks for the change to take effect; 24-hour switching is my ambition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/15">First Utility has been out in front with its target of reaching 24-hour switching. Now E.ON, SSE and Scottish Power and a number of independent suppliers, including Good Energy, Ovo and Co-operative Energy, have accepted my invitation for urgent talks over the next month on how we can dramatically speed up switching.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/16">I want five-week switching to come down to one-week switching, and then I want to go faster still. Let us be clear that it will not happen overnight. We could announce 24-hour switching and then suppliers would say, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;ll put up our prices to cover the cost&#8221;. That cannot and will not happen. I want to talk to suppliers who can agree to and deliver a plan to speed up the process of switching down to 24 hours, without increasing bills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/17">Companies that are interested in making things easier for customers to switch are invited to come and see me, in addition to the others that have already agreed to do so. Our preference is to do that jointly with suppliers, building on the good work of Energy UK, which has raised ambition on the issue across the industry, but we are prepared to take action, if required, to compel those who drag their heels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/18">I have also written to energy companies about direct debits. I share concerns that they might be holding on to significant credit balances when customers have overpaid through direct debits. I expect all suppliers to make every effort to return money to customers with closed accounts. I accept that that sometimes will not be possible, but, when it is not, my view is that credits should be applied directly to help the fuel poor and other vulnerable customers. The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40077" name="Gregory Barker">the Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase>, will meet energy suppliers next week to discuss that question and that of the level of credit balances that energy companies are holding on to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/19">In our debates on energy bills, many have understandably asked whether competition is working in our energy markets. Although the coalition has already done a great deal to promote competition, we are ready to do more. As the Prime Minister announced last week, we now propose to introduce annual reviews of the state of competition in the energy markets. The first of the new competition assessments will be delivered by spring next year. The assessment will be undertaken by Ofgem,</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/20">working closely with the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition and Markets Authority when it comes into being.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/21">The exact metrics for the review will be a matter for the regulators but I will ask them to look in depth and across the energy sector at profits and prices, barriers to entry and consumer engagement. The Government have equipped the regulators with strong powers to deal with unjustified barriers to competition. If abuses are found they must be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/22">We also need to ensure that the energy suppliers are open and honest about the profits they are making, so I have also asked Ofgem to deliver, again by spring next year, a full report on the transparency of the financial accounts of the energy companies and ways that that could be improved, building on the work already completed by accountancy firm BDO.</p>
	<p pid="a.1093.1/23">Ofgem will publish its consultation on financial transparency this afternoon, but the public need to know that our reforms will have teeth and that companies that play outside the rules will be penalised and fined. With our Energy Bill, Ofgem now has powers to require energy companies to make compensation payments directly to consumers who have lost out, but today I want to go further. That is why I intend to consult on the introduction of criminal sanctions for anyone found manipulating energy markets and harming the consumer interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.1096.1/2">As set out in the annual statement, the Government are acting to help those most in need to keep warm this winter and ensure that everybody gets a better deal from the energy companies. We are also acting to deal with Labour&#8217;s energy crunch, filling in its energy black hole with home-grown energy and bringing stability and certainty to drive investment. That is our strategy for affordable energy security, a strategy to power the country, protect the planet and help keep bills affordable. I commend the statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1096.2/1">Oh, dearie me. A coherent energy policy? I must say that I feel for the Secretary of State, because he has to deal with the fact that the Government&#8217;s energy policy is increasingly being made at the Dispatch Box by a Prime Minister who has completely lost the plot. I would like to thank him for early notice of his statement and its contents&#8212;on Sky, on the BBC&#8217;s &#8220;Watchdog&#8221; last night and on the &#8220;Today&#8221; programme this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/2">The Secretary of State was meant to be making the annual energy statement, but what we heard today would be better described as the annual excuses statement&#8212;excuses for why people&#8217;s bills are going up, excuses for why they are doing nothing about it,</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/3">and excuses for why each and every time they give the companies what they want and leave consumers to foot the bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/4">The energy companies blame social and environmental obligations for their price rises, so the Prime Minister promises to roll them back. Threatened by Labour&#8217;s price freeze and plans to reset the energy market, suddenly the companies are clamouring for another review to kick the issue into the long grass. On Tuesday the chief executive of E.ON told the Energy and Climate Change Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/5">&#8220;I believe that we need to have a thorough Competition Commission investigation, supported by Ofgem, because they are the experts&#8212;they have been in the industry for a decade.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/6">Lo and behold, today the Government have given the energy companies what they want: their review, led by the very same regulator that has let them get away with ripping people off in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/7">Then, today, we heard the big announcement: encouraging people to switch from one company to another. But the truth is that no amount of tinkering with tariffs, telling people to shop around or, as the Prime Minister suggested, wearing another jumper will solve the real problem with Britain&#8217;s energy market, because even the cheapest tariff in a rigged market will still not be a good deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/8">The proof of how weak and spineless the Government are when it comes to standing up to the energy companies is that only three weeks ago the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40077" name="Gregory Barker">the right hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase> told the BBC that the idea that Government levies were responsible for bill rises was &#8220;nonsense&#8221;, but now, boxed in by a Prime Minister who is not willing to stand up to the energy companies and a Chancellor who is actively courting climate change deniers in his own party, the Government say that the levies are to blame.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/9">It is interesting that the Secretary of State conspicuously did not talk about rolling back the green levies in his statement. The truth, of course, is that any obligation to support clean energy or improve energy efficiency must deliver value for money, but how is it possible that social and environmental obligations that, according to his Department&#8217;s own figures, make up only &#163;113 of people&#8217;s bills can account for price rises of &#163;400? Will he tell us which of the levies, 60% of which were introduced by his Government, he now wants to scrap? Is it the energy company obligation, at &#163;47, the warm home discount, at &#163;11, or the carbon price floor, at &#163;5? Does he accept that, whether it is bill payers or taxpayers who pay, unless he deals with the way people have been overcharged, he is letting the companies off the hook?</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/10">As for the annual competition review, I remind the Secretary of State that there have been 17 investigations into the energy market since 2001. If he is today announcing the launch of a new annual review of competition in the energy market, what on earth has Ofgem been doing all this time, and what does he expect it to find out in the next 10 months that it has not discovered in the past 10 years? The last review by Ofgem, to which he gave his full backing, finished only in June. This is what he said at the time:</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/11">&#8220;I welcome the continued progress of Ofgem&#8217;s reform of the retail energy market&#8230;That&#8217;s why I am backing Ofgem&#8217;s reforms&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/12">The Minister of State, the right hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle, was even more effusive. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/13">&#8220;It&#8217;s encouraging that Ofgem is going full-speed ahead with these crucial reforms to the retail energy market.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/14">Today we hear the Secretary of State saying that the Government will build on the BDO recommendations on reform of the energy market, but the truth is that Ofgem ignored BDO&#8217;s recommendations and the Government stood by it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/15">We do not need another review: we need action. We need action to freeze people&#8217;s energy bills and fix this broken market; to break up the big six by ring-fencing their generation from supply; to put an end to secret deals and require all electricity to be bought and sold via an open exchange; and to create a tough new watchdog with the power to force these companies to cut their prices when wholesale costs fall&#8212;which, I am pleased to tell the House, is now supported by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40656" name="Tim Farron">the hon. Member for Westmorland and Lonsdale (Tim Farron)</phrase>, the president of the Secretary of State&#8217;s party. That is what real action looks like.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/16">Today&#8217;s annual energy statement could not have come at a more important time. Energy prices are rising three times faster under this Government than the previous one, bills are up by &#163;300, and the latest price rises will add another &#163;100 this winter. For people in fuel poverty, the gap between their bills and what they can afford is at an all-time high, but for the companies, the mark-up between wholesale costs and the prices they charge grows ever wider. Fifty-seven households have had work done under the green deal and 7,000 workers in the insulation industry have lost their jobs. Investment in clean energy has halved, and the Government have legislated to stop any future Administration setting a decarbonisation target until 2016 at the earliest. Last year, the UK&#8217;s carbon emissions increased by more than any other country in the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.1096.2/17">That is the Government&#8217;s record. As we learned from Age UK on Monday, what it means in reality is that 3 million elderly people will not be able to stay warm in their homes this winter. They want their bills frozen, not their homes. The question they want answered today is simple: why are this Government too weak to stand up to the energy companies?</p>

	<p pid="a.1098.0/1">I thank the right hon. Lady for her response, in which there was clearly not a single apology to Britain for the black hole in energy security that the Labour party left from when it was in government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.0/2">The right hon. Lady talked a lot about Ofgem. Who created Ofgem? The Labour party. Who reformed Ofgem to make it stronger? The Leader of the Opposition. In attacking Ofgem, an independent regulator, she is attacking her own party leader&#8217;s record. We are reforming Ofgem; we have given it new, stronger powers. We have created a new regime in the Energy Bill, and there is new leadership. I believe that Ofgem can deliver on competition where the previous Government failed to deliver. We are not kicking competition into the long grass. I am determined that this first annual energy assessment on competition should deliver by next spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.0/3">The right hon. Lady talked about levies. The question is whether levies should be on bills or on taxes, and we are looking at that issue. Interestingly, she referred to a figure of &#8220;only&#8221; &#163;112. I hope that people noticed that, because her energy freeze will deliver only &#163;120&#8212;we think. So she is admitting that her energy freeze is actually the con that we have been saying it is all along.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.0/4">I end by thanking the right hon. Lady for tabling an Opposition day debate on energy bills for next Wednesday. I want to debate energy with her every day of the week, because I want to expose Labour&#8217;s appalling record on energy and its appalling policies, which would feed into the big six that it created. Labour&#8217;s big six need competition, and we are up for it&#8212;Labour is not.</p>

	<p pid="a.1110.6/1">Ofgem&#8217;s retail market review looked at different approaches to standing charges, and there is a debate on them.

	<p pid="a.1112.5/2">Amendments 18, 12 and 13 relate to the Government&#8217;s commitment to Scotland. I tabled them in Committee, because I felt it was important to have something in the Bill that registered the verbal intentions, expressed by Ministers and others, eventually to take High Speed 2, if it is ever built, through to Scotland. It is ironic, and slightly odd, that clause 3(1) extends the scope of the Bill to England, Wales and Scotland, given that there is no mention of HS2 going to Scotland.</p>

Undoubtedly, there is precedent for the Government ensuring that Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland get their fair share of the infrastructure spend that is being spent exclusively in England, and I believe there is already such a precedent regarding the money for HS2, but will the Minister confirm that?</p>

	<p pid="a.1113.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. I am afraid that I do not have the resources to table an extensive list of amendments, and although I considered that, I dismissed it fairly rapidly. I just do not have the back-up and resource, on a project this large and complex, to keep up with the machinations of the Government, as they bring out 400 or 500 pages of information a couple of days before any crucial stage of the Bill&#8212;I am expecting the &#163;50,000 environmental statement to arrive on our desks shortly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1113.5/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes a good point, but the Government recently produced the new business case, and I believe that there is doubt over the timing used for Edinburgh to London. I have been informed by a commentator that they failed to take into account the new rolling stock and the existing time savings from improvements being made to the line. I stand to be corrected&#8212;perhaps the Minister can tell us&#8212;but I believe that there has been an error in the calculation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.5/2">I would like the Bill to refer to Scotland, because it is important that a definite intent be put in the Bill. It would send a good message to Scotland, at a time when we are trying to keep this United Kingdom together, in the teeth of opposition from the nationalist parties, and I think it should be in the Bill simply for that reason.</p>

	<p pid="a.1113.6/1">I sympathise with the spirit of my right hon. Friend&#8217;s amendments, and obviously many of us who support HS2 hope it will go through to Glasgow and Edinburgh and cannot understand why we do not start building from there now&#8212;but be that as it may. I am a bit</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.6/2">worried because her amendment 18 would remove the &#8220;at least&#8221;. I read &#8220;at least&#8221; to mean that HS2 could stop at more stations. Were we to accept her amendment 18 and then her amendment 13, which would add the words</p>

	<p pid="a.1114.0/1">My amendments are intended to probe the Government&#8217;s intention. I believe that they should have made provision to include more stops on the line. For example, I would have thought that between Manchester and elsewhere, there could have been other stops giving greater benefit to some of the areas that will be destroyed by the line.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114.0/2">I tabled an amendment in Committee, and it must have struck a chord, because the official Opposition have tabled something very similar, and I am delighted to say that the Government, in an attempt to hug the Opposition closer, have now signed up to it and it has become a Government amendment. I congratulate the shadow Secretary of State on her victory. One of the major problems is with the connectivity of HS2. If it is not fully connected and integrated into our transport system, it will be the white elephant that so many of us believe it will be.</p>

	<p pid="a.1114.2/1">That is most gratifying. I am glad that my hon. Friend has observed the first rule of politicians: one can never over-flatter another politician.</p>
	<p pid="a.1114.2/2">Connectivity is at the heart of some of the failures of this project. For example, it does not go to Heathrow; it does not connect properly with the channel tunnel rail link; indeed, it does not even go into the centres of the cities it is supposed to serve, whether Sheffield, Derby or Nottingham. All the time savings claimed by the Government come to nought if travellers have to make their way from outside the city centre, as I know will be the case for Sheffield. We need to ensure that if this is ever built, the connectivity is as good as it can be.</p>

Member for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles)</phrase> that the Select Committee was very clear that High Speed 2 was the only way in which the necessary increased capacity could be obtained, and that in discussing the economic benefits, we also stated that economic development strategies were required to go together with the provision of that extra capacity?</p>

	<p pid="a.1116.9/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for that intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.9/2">A lot of people are saying that there is no alternative to HS2 if we are to solve the capacity problems, when in fact a large number of alternatives are emerging from numerous sources. Suggestions have been made by economic think-tanks and transport economists, including a recent proposal to revive the old grand central line. I fought against an ill-conceived plan to run freight on that line in the early 1990s when I was first elected to the House. That plan did not stack up economically, and we saw it off.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.9/3">Amendment 19 would narrow the scope of the Bill, which, as currently drafted, could extend to all railway operations. I do not know whether it was the intention to cover not only HS2 but all other railway operations, but the drafting seems to be a bit sloppy. If the provisions are not confined to HS2, it will make a mockery of any limits placed on the costs that the taxpayer will have to face. The amendment attempts to limit this money Bill, and to limit the expenditure to HS2, in line with what</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.9/4">I believe the Government intended. If the provision were to include Scotland, that would round up the whole package.</p>
	<p pid="a.1116.9/5">You will correct me if I am wrong, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I believe that I will have a right of reply at the end of the debate on this group of amendments, given that I moved amendment 18. I want to let colleagues speak to the other amendments. I hope that the Minister will also comment on the effects of HS2 on the areas outside the towns that will be directly connected to the line. I am sure that colleagues in this House and the other place will be concerned by the KPMG report that came out as a result of a freedom of information request. It had not been published alongside the KPMG report that came from the Government. It showed that HS2 would have a negative economic effect on many areas of the country, and I am particularly worried about some of those areas. Will the Minister tell us which areas are involved? The House needs to have that information before we start making decisions on the largest infrastructure project since the second world war. We need to know the pros and cons. I am firmly on the con side, and I have tabled my amendments accordingly. I hope that the Minister will rise to the occasion. I am pleased he has accepted my earlier amendment through the route of the Opposition, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.</p>

	<p pid="a.1117.0/1">I rise to support amendment 17. I am a firm supporter of High Speed 2. The case for it is essentially one of capacity. It is entirely wrong to state, as some commentators have done recently, that the argument for capacity is something new that has been brought in only at this stage. That is simply not so. The report that the Transport Select Committee produced two years ago made it clear that the need for increased capacity formed the basis of the case for HS2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1117.0/2">Amendment 17 deals with linking HS2 to the rest of the transport network. It specifically mentions the need for it to link to roads and airports. It is important that it should not be seen as a development that is separate from the rest of the rail network or indeed from the rest of the transport network. I therefore welcome the amendment. It is unfortunate that, because no decision has been taken on the need for increased airport capacity in the south-east, no firm proposals on Heathrow have been finalised. That matter needs urgent attention. There is also an issue about freight. In Liverpool, for example, the expansion of the port is creating a need for more freight paths and better access for freight. That, too, needs attention. I welcome the amendment in that it draws attention to networks and connectivity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1117.1/1">In speaking to amendment 17, the hon. Lady is, in essence, setting out an early case for design changes. Can she confirm that the existing contingency in the spending envelope does not include provision for any such changes?</p>

	<p pid="a.1117.2/1">The hon. Gentleman needs to direct such questions to HS2 itself. It is extremely important that all the financial aspects are fully considered. This specific amendment is to do with networks. The question of access to the high-speed network is critical, and that involves roads as well as other rail tracks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1117.2/2">The case for HS2 is also based on increased economic benefit to the areas in which the railway stations are located, as well as the surrounding areas and the regions that they serve. The issue of freed capacity on the west coast main line as a result of phase 1, and on the east coast and midland main lines following phase 2, is critical. The strategic review states that there will be a &#163;3 billion benefit from the use of freed capacity, and Network Rail has stated that more than 100 cities and towns could benefit.</p>

	<p pid="a.1118.0/1">Those benefits will be crucial to areas such as Birmingham and the west midlands. One of the advantages of HS2 to the west midlands will be that it will free up capacity on the west coast main line and improve connectivity to regions like the black country, part of which I represent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1118.1/1">Indeed; the hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. We must not look simply at the HS2 line itself; we must also consider how its connectivity to other lines and other parts of the transport network can be developed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1118.2/1">If the principal benefit is now capacity rather than speed&#8212;this seems very much how the argument has moved&#8212;why not slow it down? If it is slowed down, we will no longer have the engineers I sit down with every week telling me, &#8220;We can&#8217;t go around Water Orton primary school because speed means it must be a straight line; we can&#8217;t go around ancient bluebell woods because speed means it must be a straight line.&#8221; If we slow it down, we will be able to avoid going over many of the sensitive areas on the route and perhaps even put in more stations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1118.3/1">The strategic review and other studies indicate that alternatives have been looked at and rejected. Network Rail states that more than 100 cities and towns could benefit from this development. Named in the various reports are places including Watford, Milton Keynes, Rugby and Northampton, but many more are possible. There is also a need to increase capacity for freight, which is as important as passengers. About 20 new freight paths can be developed, but I would view that as the absolute minimum.</p>

	<p pid="a.1118.4/1">I hear what the hon. Lady says about freight. How does she react to what Lord Berkeley said? He heads up the Rail Freight group and said that HS2 will in fact constrain freight because it does not link up properly with the existing network on the west coast main line and its northern end in phases 1 and 2? He should know, should he not?</p>

	<p pid="a.1118.5/1">Lord Berkeley was pointing out issues of practical difficulty, but they can be worked on. Indeed, the purpose of this debate and subsequent debates is to identify where the problems are and to do something about them. No plans are finalised. We are talking about principles and strategies. It is essential to look at critical detail and to make changes where they are necessary. Debates such as this one are an integral part of that important process.</p>

Does she think this will be the last revision, or will there be another 25 over the next 25 years to justify the case? I simply cannot believe it: it is amazing that the project has gone up by &#163;10 billion and the Government have now managed to find &#163;10 billion-worth of supposed benefits.

	<p pid="a.1119.2/1">It is for Ministers to say why the business case has been reviewed so many times, but when the Transport Select Committee looked at the issue two years ago, it approved a high-speed line, but pointed to a number of critical areas where it was felt more work should be done, which included looking again at the business case. One reason for that was the valuation put on the time people spent travelling, when it was alleged they could not work. We thought that that was not a correct valuation and that it should be looked at again. We raised issues of environmental concern and said they should be looked at again, as we did with issues relating to economic impact, particularly the need to have economic development strategies as well as the essential rail travel links.</p>
	<p pid="a.1119.2/2">The Select Committee called for a review of the case, looking at those specific factors and stressing the importance of relevant and up-to-date information. We thought it would be absolutely wrong to use information that was not up to date and that ignored the concerns we had raised. The report supported the project in principle, but raised real concerns, which we said must be addressed before any final decision could be taken. Not all of those concerns have yet been addressed, but some of them have been, as we have discussed today.</p>

It is important to assess individual aspects of the project, but we also need to look at the concept and what it is trying to achieve. It is about expanding essential infrastructure in this country. If we do not have vision and if we are not prepared to look ahead at the nation&#8217;s needs, we will lack the essential infrastructure needed for economic prosperity. It is essential, too, to look at the detail, which is why we called for a review of the cost-benefit ratio, for a review of the environmental and economic factors and for up-to-date information on the projections of capacity, for freight as well as passengers. The concept must not be lost in the vital necessity to look at the individual components and make an assessment of them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1122.2/3">I referred earlier to initiatives taken in the west midlands and to statements made by the Core Cities Group, and I know that a great deal of work is being done in Manchester, but I am not sure that that is happening everywhere in the country, and I think it important for someone to take the lead. Of course work must be done in the regions. Elected Members and local businesses know their areas and are aware of the opportunities and the potential, but someone should be ensuring that the same is happening nationally, so that we do not miss out on the vital and perhaps unique opportunity to develop our network for the benefit of localities, regions, and indeed the country as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="a.1123.3/1">Obviously we are talking about a lot of money, but if it is true that the rail capacity of the three main north-south lines will be exhausted within about 15 years, what impact does my hon. Friend expect that to have on the economies of the cities north of London?</p>

	<p pid="a.1123.4/1">My hon. Friend has made a crucial point, which goes to the nub of the matter. If those lines run out of capacity&#8212;which, indeed, they are rapidly doing&#8212;a grave blow will be dealt to the economies in the northern regions, in terms of passengers and freight. One of the reasons why more freight cannot travel by rail now is the fact that no freight lines are available. High Speed 2 will solve that problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.1123.6/1">The Committee was very clear about the fact that this is about the future, and about long-term thinking. I strongly believe that while it is always essential to scrutinise spending, it is also essential to have vision. If we do not have vision, we do not have a future. I note that the aim of Lord Deighton&#8217;s taskforce is to maximise the economic benefit that can result from High Speed 2, but I am not sure whether that includes expanding connectivity and making the maximum use of freed lines, as well as more economic development issues. I ask the Minister to give us a response at the relevant time as to who, if anybody, is in charge of expanding connectivity and the opportunities offered by HS2 so the maximum economic benefit can be realised. HS2 is needed for capacity reasons, and it produces major</p>
	<p pid="a.1123.6/2">economic development opportunities for most parts of the country, but they must be grasped, and unless somebody is in charge of making sure that happens, they will be squandered.</p>

	<p pid="a.1124.0/1">Of the amendments in this group, I was delighted to be able to add my name to amendment 17 tabled by the Labour Front-Bench team. That demonstrates the cross-party support and co-operation we will need to deliver this project, which is so vital to the future of our country. Indeed, when I offered to add my name, I was asked, &#8220;Would you like to go on first, Minister?&#8221; I said, &#8220;No, no; I wouldn&#8217;t want people to get the wrong idea.&#8221; Our intention has always been for this landmark project to be part of a truly connected and integrated transport system, and the amendment would ensure that any preparatory work needed to integrate HS2 with the rest of our transport infrastructure can be funded using the Bill&#8217;s expenditure powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.0/2">Phases 1 and 2 of HS2 will directly link eight of Britain&#8217;s 10 largest cities, serving one in five of the UK population. HS2 will also connect to the existing rail network, so as soon as phase 1 is built, high-speed rail trains can start directly serving 28 cities in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.0/3">I welcome the reference to &#8220;footpaths&#8221; and &#8220;cycleways&#8221; in amendment 17 tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40625" name="Mary Creagh">the hon. Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh)</phrase>, and I should point out that as part of the Government&#8217;s wider commitments to boosting cycling in the UK, in August 2013 the Prime Minister announced the commissioning of a feasibility study to explore how we might create a new cycleway that broadly follows the proposed HS2 corridor. Such routes would also be open to pedestrians&#8212;presumably this is a case of great minds thinking alike. The cycleway could provide cycling and walking routes for the public to enjoy, linking local communities and stations to the countryside and tourist destinations along the way, and benefiting those living along the HS2 route.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.0/4">HS2 will be at the centre of an unprecedented level of investment in the nation&#8217;s transport infrastructure. From 2015-16 to 2020-21 the Government have committed &#163;56 billion-worth of investment in road and rail, on top of the &#163;16.5 billion investment in HS2. We are investing more than &#163;6 billion in this Parliament and &#163;12 billion in the next on road maintenance, enough to resurface 80% of the national road network and fill 19 million potholes each year.</p>

	<p pid="a.1124.2/1">The Department has gained a lot of experience in managing big projects from projects such as Crossrail. Following the appointment of Sir David Higgins to head HS2 from January onwards I feel very confident indeed that we can deliver this project on budget and on time. Indeed, the budget is about &#163;50 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.2/2">Therefore, if rolling stock were excluded and nothing else was done with the Department&#8217;s budget, this project would be the equivalent of about 10 months of the Department&#8217;s total budget. That puts it into context.</p>
	<p pid="a.1124.2/3">We are adding 400 miles of capacity to our busiest motorways thanks to work scheduled in this Parliament and the next, and between 2014 and 2019 Network Rail has put forward plans to spend &#163;37.5 billion on improvements to the railways. We are clearly not putting all our eggs in the HS2 basket, therefore&#8212;far from it, in fact.</p>

	<p pid="a.1125.3/1">Indeed, that will increase choice for people who have the unfortunate experience in life of having to live in the south-east of England. It will give them more opportunities to visit the north and use airports up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1125.3/2">We need to ensure that we maximise the cumulative benefit of individual investments by ensuring they are all properly connected. I have to say that amendments 18 and 19 in the name of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase> slightly confuse me. Amendment 19 seeks to limit expenditure to projects under phases 1 and 2 of the Bill, which finishes in Leeds and Manchester, but amendment 18 says that there should be more connectivity in Scotland. There is a degree of contradiction in those two amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1125.4/1">My hon. Friend has just said that phase 2 finishes in Manchester, which indeed it does as far as the business case and the benefits statement KPMG produced are concerned, yet under phase 2 we are building a 40 km spur north of Manchester. I wonder about the logic of that, since there is a &#163;1 billion cost with no benefit. Is that an under-run that the Minister could book at this point?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-31a.1126.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" speakername="Robert Goodwill" colnum="1126"  time="013:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0002.htm#131031-0002.htm_spnew193">
	<p pid="a.1126.0/1">The trains do not stop at Manchester and Leeds; they keep going. In terms of the connectivity of this new system, it is important that we take traffic away from the existing rail network and allow more freight and passenger services so as to address the problem of the 5,000 people every weekday morning who are standing as they arrive at New Street in Birmingham. To address that problem we need to ensure we have the connectivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/2">Limiting this legislation to a particular phase, or to particular phases, would simply mean that a further Bill would be required to be placed before Parliament to prepare for any potential future phase.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/3">On Scotland, I would simply say that officials from the Scottish Government made clear during this Bill&#8217;s Committee stage that they are content with the Bill as it is, and see no need for the naming of any locations in Scotland. The critical point is that the network is defined as &#8220;at least&#8221; including the named locations in the Bill. Therefore, not including locations in Scotland will not be a barrier to high-speed rail extending there at some point in the future. The locations named are limited to those which have been named in public consultation documents issued by the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.0/4">Again I must stress that while some rolling stock will run exclusively on the high-speed network, so-called classic compatible gauge trains will run through to Glasgow and Edinburgh. These new trains are part of the &#163;7.5 billion rolling stock investment in the project and their arrival in Scottish cities will demonstrate how HS2 will benefit Scotland at an early stage.</p>

	<p pid="a.1126.2/1">That will be for the railway companies to decide; it will be up to them to decide how best to utilise this stock. Obviously, the rolling stock will be rolled out as it is produced, but having trains arriving in Glasgow and Edinburgh at that early stage of the project will make a major contribution to helping to keep our kingdom united.</p>

	<p pid="a.1126.3/1">I wish to begin by welcoming the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" name="Robert Goodwill">the hon. Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr Goodwill)</phrase> to his place. I know that he has a strong personal interest in transport issues. Although I am sure we will disagree on many issues, I am glad that we have been able to reach agreement on a number of today&#8217;s amendments, and I look forward to our future debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.3/2">Amendment 17 has its origins in the Bill&#8217;s Committee stage. Members on both sides of the House contributed to its development, after my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> moved an amendment requiring integration with other modes of transport. The Minister at the time, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the right hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>, who is in his place, said that he was minded to accept it. We want people to have a real choice about how to travel, be it by rail, by car, on a bicycle or by walking. We especially want to make sure that active travel is an attractive option, because it has many huge benefits, including for health and tackling congestion. We want that to be</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.3/3">encouraged, so we welcomed the move to have better integration. We warned, however, that any amendment should pay regard to walking, cycling and light railways, so I am pleased that those concerns have been addressed by this sensibly worded addition to the Bill&#8212;of course I would say that, because it stands partly in my name.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.3/4">Light rail will play an important role in linking stations in Birmingham, the east midlands and Sheffield to the high-speed network. The importance of making conventional rail accessible to pedestrians and cyclists is now recognised across the country; we have seen increasingly that railways stations have been adapted in that respect. It is right to enshrine that objective in the legislation for HS2. It is a real achievement that both cycling and walking will now be acknowledged in the Bill on the same basis as other modes of travel. We need to acknowledge that when people make a journey they regard it as starting when they close their front door. Making that whole journey as seamless as possible&#8212;not just the train bit, but how they get to the railway station and how they progress at the end&#8212;is vital. We therefore welcome the approach that has been taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1126.3/5">Amendment 17 is a good example of a Bill being improved through parliamentary scrutiny. Integration between high-speed rail and the conventional rail network will benefit communities far beyond the areas directly served, and we want to make sure that HS2 is fully accessible to everyone, irrespective of their mode of travel. I am happy to commend the amendment to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1127.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that. He is right to say that we cannot afford the new high-speed rail line to become a &#8220;rich man&#8217;s toy&#8221;, as a former Secretary of State put it. Clearly the new network must be available to everyone, and I am sure the Minister will confirm the view that the fares will be no greater than they are on the current network.</p>

	<p pid="a.1128.0/1">The hon. Lady has moved on to the question of capacity on the west coast main line. Does she accept that the heavy growth that took place on that line occurred immediately after the upgrade in 2008, and that since that upgrade the rates of increase have slowed tremendously and that, therefore, there could be additional capacity on the existing line? Does she also accept that we can create more capacity by having longer carriages, and by changing the mix between first and second class?</p>

	<p pid="a.1128.1/1">It is well known that on the west coast main line the additional capacity created by the upgrade is already starting to run out and that the line will be full. Of course we can create additional capacity on a train by converting some carriages from first class to standard class, but that does not create extra space on the line for additional trains. As the Minister acknowledged, places such as Shrewsbury and Blackpool want to have an additional direct service but cannot because the capacity is just not available. I am sure that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40510" name="Mark Pawsey">the hon.

	<p pid="a.1128.3/1">I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman did not address that to the Minister who is responsible for the railway. I feel like I have been given entire responsibility for it, although I would be happy if we swapped places. The point is that the capacity is not available at the times when people want to travel&#8212;at peak times&#8212;and that there is insufficient capacity for additional services and for freight, which is also vital.</p>

	<p pid="a.1128.5/1">I am sure that many people who want to go to the north would not, for a minute, wish to get off at Milton Keynes. The fact is that there simply is not enough capacity. I am sure that people who live in Milton Keynes are looking forward to the extra capacity created by HS2 and the possibility of additional services, particularly for commuters, that that will free up on the west coast main line.</p>
	<p pid="a.1128.5/2">Let me now deal with the amendments relating to the links to Scotland. Labour has always supported the principle of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland, which is why the previous Labour Government set up HS2 Ltd to examine possible routes to Scotland. HS2 will bring real benefits, enabling faster journey times and adding to capacity on the main line routes to Scotland. We</p>
	<p pid="a.1128.5/3">wanted to put those benefits in the Bill in Committee, but we were told by Transport Scotland that the Scottish Government opposed altering the Bill. It was therefore somewhat curious to see the Scottish National party tabling such amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1128.5/4">One purpose of the Bill is to provide a legal basis for future extensions of the high-speed network, providing that the economic case can be made for them. With the Government failing to keep the costs under control, we need to focus today on the HS2 network as planned. I would be interested to hear what work the Government are doing on the costs and benefits of extending the line. We have seen reports in the media that the Government are going to launch a feasibility study into extending the line to Scotland. I do not know whether the Minister would like to take this opportunity to intervene to confirm that and explain the timetable for the study.</p>

If that were true, High Speed 1 could have been construed by the Eurosceptics on the Government Benches as part of some major European integration project, and the high-speed line that is going through the Baltic countries up to Helsinki would be seen as some nation-unification project.

	<p pid="a.1130.0/2">It is particular pleasure to see the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" name="Robert Goodwill">the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr Goodwill)</phrase>, in his place and leading on the issue. It is an important issue and I know that he will do well on it, ably supported by officials at both the Department for Transport and High Speed 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1130.0/3">I support amendment 17 and oppose amendment 18 and the amendments that flow from it. In many ways I have a feeling of d&#233;j&#224; vu, because we had copious debates in Committee on the matter, and I never quite understood why so many people got certain parts of their apparel in such knots over the issue. It is clear from clause 1(2) that the Bill applies to</p>
	<p pid="a.1130.0/4">&#8220;railway lines connecting at least&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1130.0/5">London,</p>
	<p pid="a.1130.0/6">Birmingham,</p>
	<p pid="a.1130.0/7">the East Midlands&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1130.0/8">and so on. The whole point of the Bill and the purpose of getting it on to the statute book is to provide financing not of an actual project, but of the preparations for the project ad infinitum, because High Speed 2 need not necessarily stop at Leeds or Manchester. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport made that plain in October last year, when he announced that he was going to set up an inquiry into the feasibility of a third phase to Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1130.0/9">The Bill will allow the expenditure of money for the preparation of not only phases 1 and 2, but potentially phase 3, if there is one, a spur to south Wales, if a business case were made that it was needed, to the south-west or&#8212;a possibility closer, I suspect, to the heart of the distinguished Chair of the Transport Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40370" name="Louise Ellman">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman)</phrase>&#8212;all the way into Liverpool. The Bill grants the Government permission to spend the money on those preparations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1130.0/10">The thought that there will not be full and proper consideration of the continuation of the project to Scotland at some point is bizarre. It is an obvious part of a viable rail network along the spine of the country for it to continue in time to Glasgow, Edinburgh and potentially&#8212;depending on the wishes of Government and the business case at the time&#8212;beyond that. That is what the Bill does.</p>

As I was not a member of the Committee, it obviously was not mine. He has outlined what so many critics beyond this place say of the Bill&#8212;that it is a blank cheque.

	<p pid="a.1131.3/2">My right hon. Friend advances an argument, but repeating it does not mean it becomes more accurate. That argument is that the project has a blank cheque. It does not have a blank cheque. It is not a machine for printing money. There are very tight financial procedures in place to ensure that it does not exceed budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.1131.3/3">Before anyone asks how that can be considered a viable proposition, one should look at Crossrail, the largest engineering project in Europe at present, a multi-billion pound project. Owing to tight financial controls, it is on time and on budget, and I have every confidence that, with the mechanisms that have been put in place, that will be the case with HS2. I see figures quoted about what the project will cost which are from Alice in Wonderland. The cost is &#163;42.6 billion, but that sum includes &#163;14.4 billion of contingency funding, of which the vast majority, I am confident, will not be spent.</p>

	<p pid="a.1132.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an extremely valid point. I was particularly interested to hear his views in the debate because he is a Kent MP. When I first came into the House 26 and a half years ago, in one of the first Adjournment debates I ever sat in and listened to&#8212;I confess that I have not listened to many since, except those that I have taken part in&#8212;two of my hon. Friends made a vigorous case that, if High Speed 1 went ahead, it would turn the garden of England into the garbage can of England, destroy house prices, ruin the economy of Kent and end the world as we knew it. High Speed 1 went ahead and Kent&#8217;s economy has been regenerated and improved. House prices have not gone through the floor; in fact, house prices along the line of route have kept pace with those in other areas. In some cases, they have increased beyond them because of the houses&#8217; proximity to good commuter links. Capacity has increased, particularly for those commuters who are prepared to use High Speed 1 from Canterbury, for example, to London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1132.0/2">The supreme irony is that one town in Kent, Maidstone, successfully lobbied not to have a station&#8212;it was put at Ebbsfleet instead&#8212;and people are now begging for a station at Maidstone because they are missing out on the regeneration and improvements to the economy that are taking place in Ashford and Ebbsfleet. The other irony&#8212;my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase> should listen carefully to this, because I know she is a lady with an open mind and strong views&#8212;is that Kent county council, along with hon. Members of this House, led the opposition to High Speed 1 in the late &#8217;80s but is now a strong supporter of the high-speed railway because of the benefits it has brought to the community and the county. The leaders and officials of Kent county council have offered to go and talk to the leaders of Buckinghamshire county council, Warwickshire county council and Staffordshire county council to explain that in their experience the railway did not destroy their communities or environment but actually greatly enhanced them. Unfortunately, there is certainly one county council that does not seem to have the wish or the will to hear the facts or the benefits that high-speed rail could bring.</p>

	<p pid="a.1132.3/1">I will not give way, for the simple reason that many of my hon.

I think it is fair to say that we have had many interventions from him today, so perhaps there might be a chance for someone else to have a turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1132.3/2">The country needs this project because of all the important arguments: the greater connectivity; the fact that it is an engine for growth; the regeneration along the line of route; and, most importantly, the fact that it will deal with the capacity issue. I think that when High Speed 2 was announced in late 2008 and into 2009, little thought was given to its name. Those who took the decisions immediately called it High Speed 2, as they already had High Speed 1. Unfortunately, it is a misnomer that has, in some ways, led us up a cul-de-sac.</p>
	<p pid="a.1132.3/3">Of course, faster journey times are important, but they are not the most important thing. The most important thing is capacity. As I have said before, to echo what Tony Blair said in a different context, it is about capacity, capacity, capacity. The west coast main line will be full by 2024. We need capacity on the conventional railway for those who want to travel between London, Birmingham and Manchester but do not want to go along the whole route, and we need capacity to get even more freight off our congested roads and on to the railways.</p>

In effect, it will be a parallel conventional rail line like the west coast main line. All the reports on having a conventional new rail line in parallel rather than a high-speed one show that it would cost about 90% of the cost of HS2 but without the benefits that high-speed railways bring.</p>

	<p pid="a.1133.5/1">No, I will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133.5/2">Unfortunately, a project of this scale and size cannot meet the problems and objections of every part of the route while still keeping to the reason for and need behind the railway. It is rotten when one cannot deal with every problem, but we need to balance what is in the national interest against what can be done to minimise the impact. I believe that the Secretary of State for Transport, his Ministers, the Department for Transport and High Speed 2 Ltd have gone a considerable way&#8212;as far as they can&#8212;towards meeting and overcoming those problems without ruining the concept of high-speed rail and without it being disastrous for the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1133.5/3">For those reasons, I am as confident as one can be that High Speed 2 will become High Speed 3 and go to Scotland, and that in years to come it will go to other parts of the United Kingdom as well. That can happen in an orderly way only if this Bill is passed to enable</p>
	<p pid="a.1133.5/4">money to be spent on the preparations&#8212;not on building the railway, because the Bill does not deal with that. For those reasons, I will support the hon.

	<p pid="a.1134.2/1">I shall try to be brief. I have tabled amendment 23 on the link between the network and Heathrow. Some hon. Members will understand that I have raised the issue on behalf of my constituents, as is my right, in each debate we have had on High Speed 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134.2/2">Let me briefly give the context. My background is in supporting rail expansion and investment. I represent a constituency with a railway estate and a large number of railway workers and, in addition, I chair the RMT trade union group in Parliament. We have been strongly behind the development of increased capacity and investment, so when the idea of high-speed rail was first proposed it was welcomed in my constituency for a number of reasons. One was that if we could get railway journeys below four hours, that would take pressure off Heathrow airport and reduce the need short-haul flights into Heathrow. That assisted in our campaign against the expansion of Heathrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134.2/3">When the route was published, every Member south of Birmingham could assess its impact on their constituency, except me, because the link to Heathrow was not included. The route of the link to Old Oak Common was published, but then we were told that there would be a direct link at some stage, the options would be published, there would be a consultation, a preferred option would be considered, compensation arrangements for those affected would be discussed and then this House would made a considered decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134.2/4">There are real concerns about the environmental impact where the network hits the north of my borough. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40621" name="John Randall">The right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir John Randall)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40511" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd)</phrase> have valiantly argued the case for their constituents and achieved some tunnelling, but a lot more needs to be done. Other facilities that serve the whole borough will be affected, such as the Hillingdon outdoor activities centre, which will need to be relocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134.2/5">I am also concerned that my constituents now have no idea what impact the route will have on them because, following the introduction of the Davies commission, the whole timetable and consultation process for the link to Heathrow have been deferred until after the next</p>
	<p pid="a.1134.2/6">general election, which means more years of blight for my constituents. That affects all of them, because nine different options for linking to Heathrow are being discussed, which means everyone&#8217;s home or business is under threat. That is no way to run a railway or consult on such a massive project. We were promised a logical process with a tight time scale. We were told that as the main network was decided, the routes would be published, there would be consultation on a preferred route, and a decision would be made relatively speedily, which would at least have given us some certainty. That has all gone now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1134.2/7">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40462" name="Lilian Greenwood">the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood)</phrase> said that we do not want to put off any decision on high-speed rail until after the Davies commission reports. The solution, then, is simply to ensure that the commission reports earlier. The fact that it is due to report after the next general election is a political fudge to get everybody off the hook. In the coming six weeks the commission will report on a range of options, but there will be no final report until after the general election. Why is that length of time needed? All the experts, and indeed a number of Government Members, have been clear that the deadline could be brought forward so that we can have certainty about the Government&#8217;s preferred option before the next general election.</p>

	<p pid="a.1135.1/1">I understand that, which is why I said that Members south of Birmingham known roughly what the route will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.1135.1/2">I was given promises and undertakings in this House about the process that would be followed to determine the route of the link to Heathrow. At least we thought we had some certainty on the time scale for the consultations. In fact, I was holding public meetings to go into some detail about the compensation arrangements for whatever option was to be proceeded with. Now it is all up in the air again and the route that the link will take is uncertain. The Government have opened discussions about a potential third runway at Heathrow. Sometimes Members can become paranoid in this House and think that they are coming for them.</p>

If we are planning for transport infrastructure of in the long term, we must ensure that it is integrated. The way to have integration for this project is by ensuring that the timetable set out for HS2 is integrated with the Davies commission&#8217;s report, which means having the report sooner. That could be within six months after the initial report is published this month. The decision could then be taken before the next general election. It is also about being more honest with the electorate on rail and aviation, and not only in my constituency, but nationally.</p>

Otherwise, I will take every opportunity I can to vote against high-speed rail until my constituents are satisfied that their views have been taken into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.1136.4/1">I rise to support amendment 17 and will speak extremely briefly. My views on HS2 are fairly widely known, but I want to place on the record that the project is needed now. The west coast main line is nearly full, and as a regular traveller on that service I know that it is essential for many commuters. HS2 is about capacity as well as speed, a fact that is sometimes lost in the argument. I totally understand where those of my colleagues who oppose it are coming from, as there are also strong views in my constituency, but I firmly believe</p>
	<p pid="a.1136.4/2">that it is of huge national importance and must go ahead. In my region, the west midlands, we cannot ignore the facts: a &#163;1.5 billion increase in economic output, thousands of additional jobs and increased wages.</p>

	<p pid="a.1137.1/2">As Members have heard already today, I am a big champion of Birmingham international airport. To be able to access it from Euston in just 38 minutes will make a huge difference to the people of north London. It will mean a choice between either Birmingham or Gatwick and Heathrow&#8212;I know which airport I would choose. Those Members who have travelled from Birmingham international airport know how excellent it is, and those who have not should try it, because they will not regret it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137.1/3">HS2 is also about rebalancing our economy. We talk about that a lot, but this is proof that we are serious about getting on with it. I know that we will hear many arguments for and against HS2 today, but I am sure that they were heard when the House debated HS1. This is something that the country needs, so we should all be brave and stand up for the national interest. We owe it to our constituents and to our country. I hope that colleagues will join me in the Lobby tonight to vote for something north of Watford.</p>

	<p pid="a.1137.2/1">I wish to speak to amendment 28 tabled in my name on behalf of my party.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137.2/2">The Scottish National party and the Scottish Government have been supportive of HS2 in principle. Of course, that is conditional on it being properly managed and, most importantly, it coming to Scotland, so that Scotland, which pays more tax per capita than the UK average, can benefit from it. We also look to help the rest of the UK. As I mentioned earlier, the line that links Seville to Madrid, which it was envisaged would help Seville alone, benefited both ends, as, on reflection, it should have done. We want this link because it would link us into the wider European high-speed rail project that will be found in many places in Europe. Scotland, as an economic powerhouse, deserves to be part of that, not just for Scotland but for the rest of Europe, which deserves to have Scotland linked with it. This will be happening in 25 or 30 years, by which time quite a few of us will not be in this Chamber, if on this earth; we are leaving a legacy for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1137.2/3">I am glad to hear that Baroness Kramer will be coming to Scotland tomorrow as part of seeing what benefits can be brought not just to Scotland but to the wider UK and wider Europe through increased links to the central belt of Scotland, which is an important market.</p>

If HS2 goes ahead, the 30 trains a day we have now will be reduced to three and there will be an extra hour&#8217;s journey time to pick up the HS2 link, so my constituents will go from taking one hour and 23 minutes to get to London to taking two and a half hours.

	<p pid="a.1138.8/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, thinking is always evolving. When a person is content, they can become happier as a result of improvements. The Liberal</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.8/2">Democrats started from a position of being opposed to student tuition fees and seemed to be content with that, but the position evolved so that they wanted &#163;9,000 tuition fees for students, and they seemed happier still. He will probably understand that I think that our evolution towards happiness is perhaps a bit more understanding of the needs of citizens, whereas the evolution of the Liberal Democrats&#8217; thinking leaves many people in debt, unfortunately.</p>
	<p pid="a.1138.8/3">We want Scotland to be linked to a high-speed European network. The mistake made earlier, originally by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase>, was to think that this is some sort of political project. It is not. There are high-speed rail links all over the place. They go to Helsinki through the Baltic states, and there is no movement for political unity between those states. They fiercely retain their independence while supporting and helping each other to get rail links, including high-speed links, through their countries to move into the main European markets. That is a natural and understandable thing to do. Many states in Europe are independent and co-operating together. In fact, Europe has not been as together as it is now, with its 50 independent states, since the empires declined.</p>

	<p pid="a.1140.1/1">I am glad to hear Conservative Members speak against privatisation. That is very encouraging. Perhaps they should have thought about that with regard to Royal Mail, when they transferred loads of people&#8217;s money from the taxpayer to private pockets. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I think I misheard the hon. Gentleman and he said &#8220;Barnettisation&#8221;. It is the accent&#8212;I am sorry. If he is indeed talking about Barnettisation, I will come to that point. If he is patient, as I am sure he will be, he will get an understanding of exactly what our viewpoint is.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140.1/2">It is important that HS2 happens and that we work within Scotland to make sure that we have connectivity and can benefit by linking into the network. The Scottish Government do not agree with the assumptions that have been made by KPMG and the Department for Transport. We feel that there is an error in some of the modelling and that some of the assumptions are out of date. We are more pleased with what came out of the Department yesterday, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1140.1/3">&#8220;Scotland will benefit from high speed services from Edinburgh and Glasgow as soon as Phase One of HS2 opens. Phase Two is expected to reduce journey times by up to an hour without the need to change trains, benefiting the Scottish economy. The Government&#8217;s goal is for a network that brings the country closer together, so we are taking forward a study with the Scottish Government to consider how these benefits could be extended further. This is looking at how to boost capacity and cut journey times between Glasgow/Edinburgh and London to less than three hours&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140.1/4">That journey time offers further access to an inter-European market, which is vital for Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140.1/5">I hope there will be Barnett consequentials, which are important, so that Scotland can prepare for the benefits of the extension of European high-speed rail. We could consider a link north of Edinburgh up towards Aberdeen. I often remark that the rail journey between Glasgow and Fort William takes about three hours, but the distance is only 100 miles. The average speed is 33 mph, so perhaps medium-speed rail would improve journey times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140.1/6">The benefits of HS2 will be strong, but they will be stronger still when Scotland is included, as the example of Seville and Madrid shows. We shall work for assurances from the UK Government that they will consider a sensible extension that will benefit not just Scotland, but the south-east of England and the European markets. This is in everybody&#8217;s economic interest, as shown by the Baltic line running from Helsinki to the European markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1140.1/7">High-speed rail will benefit everybody. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40634" name="David Mowat">the hon. Member for Warrington South (David Mowat)</phrase> flippantly said earlier, the counter-arguments suggest that, if connectivity is such a bad idea, closing the M6 would result in a boom in the north. Of course, that is nonsense. As Adam Smith said in &#8220;The Wealth of Nations&#8221;, the more markets and economies are linked, the better for all. There will be mutual benefits and we will all win.</p>

I am puzzled that opponents of the scheme seem to think that a high-speed, modern railway system that is fit for the 21st century and that would increase economic activity throughout the whole of the United Kingdom would not benefit the country as a whole, but only those cities directly served by it. Surely it is clear that a line that would improve north-south links&#8212;I include Scotland in that&#8212;would at the same time improve and grow the economy of the whole of the United Kingdom, including my constituency of Eastleigh.</p>

	<p pid="a.1142.6/1">I rise to support amendment 17 and I will support the Bill later, too.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.6/2">I want to pick up on one particular point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase> made at the beginning of the debate and with which I agree, namely the connectivity problem with HS2, particularly the lack of a proper link to High Speed 1. That is a serious problem and it needs to be addressed. I recognise that there has been some improvement in the view of how the two high-speed lines should be connected, but the current proposal&#8212;this is extraordinary&#8212;is for a single track, shared connection and a capacity of only three trains per hour going rather slowly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.6/3">The argument is that that is sufficient capacity for the international services likely to be coming to High Speed 2 from the channel tunnel. That may be correct, at least in</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.6/4">the early years: three an hour may be enough. However, with that constraint in place, it would be impossible to run regular domestic services from High Speed 2 to High Speed 1, even though we need those regular connections. Research commissioned by my local authority, the London borough of Newham, suggests that there could be demand for seven trains per hour on the interconnection between HS2 and HS1 to meet the needs of domestic services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1142.6/5">I have found this discussion interesting. I agree with the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40262" name="Damian Collins">the hon. Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins)</phrase> about the regeneration benefits of HS1, and that is largely due to domestic services. I think, therefore, that the new high-speed line has to be built with sufficient capacity for the domestic services we will need. We certainly want HS2 to connect to Kent, East Anglia and other destinations, and we need proper interconnection between the two high-speed lines in order to facilitate that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1144.4/1">No, I will not give way again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.4/2">I welcome amendment 17 and the Government&#8217;s support for it. I have raised this matter with Ministers before, but I ask the new Minister for the first time to pay particular attention to the connectivity problem between High Speed 1 and High Speed 2, which was highlighted by the right hon.

	<p pid="a.1144.5/1">I welcome the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" name="Robert Goodwill">the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr Goodwill)</phrase>, to the Front Bench. It is a pleasure to see him there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.5/2">Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, at least from this side of the Chamber&#8212;I must say what a great view one gets from the back of the stands&#8212;I am happy to speak in support of amendment 17.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.5/3">I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40306" name="John McDonnell">the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell)</phrase> has had to go to Westminster Hall to check up on GCHQ, but, to use words that he would understand, I give him my fraternal solidarity and will support amendment 23. I know that it is rather impractical, but that does not always stop us supporting an amendment. The issues with Heathrow, which affect his constituents badly, also affect mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.5/4">Because the Heathrow loop is in the second phase of the project, we cannot have a decision on it. The Minister said that connectivity with Heathrow will be amply secured through Old Oak Common, so regardless of any decision on the expansion of Heathrow, which I hope will not happen, perhaps we can save a bit of money and scrap the Heathrow loop straight away. That would bring great benefits to the London borough of Hillingdon where we stand as one, although not to my constituency specifically because there will be tunnelling</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.5/5">there. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40511" name="Nick Hurd">the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd)</phrase> and I face some severe problems. It would help immeasurably if there was no Heathrow loop, because the tunnelling could be extended past the houses in Ickenham. There is understandably a considerable amount of opposition to HS2 emerging just next to those properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.5/6">I will not take long, because I want to get on to the proposals on compensation and mitigation. Perhaps I am being rather optimistic. It is a very important subject. I would like to have had the chance to mention the awful position of the Hillingdon outdoor activities centre. I want that to be looked at. My hon. Friend the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner has written to the Minister about various matters and I back him up entirely.</p>
	<p pid="a.1144.5/7">Unlike the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington, who will oppose the Bill tonight, I will support it in the hope and expectation that our gentle requests will be looked on more favourably if I am not too much of a pain during this early outing on this matter. However, I say to my right hon. and hon. Friends on the Front Bench that after this rare outbreak of good-natured bonhomie, I will be going back to the default position of grumpy old man of Uxbridge.</p>

	<p pid="a.1145.0/1">It behoves all of us who are sceptical about HS2 to suggest practical and realistic alternatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/2">Some people say that the project is about capacity, not speed, and others say that it is about speed, not capacity, but most of the emphasis has been on capacity. The capacity problem is between London and Birmingham, not elsewhere in the country, where we could have more trains without any difficulty. It is that section of our railway network that I will address.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/3">There is an alternative route from Birmingham Snow Hill to Paddington. The trains currently run to Marylebone, but they could easily run to Paddington, which would be quicker and would link up with Crossrail. InterCity 125s could run on that line from the centre of Birmingham to Paddington&#8212;a very convenient station&#8212;at very little expense. That would solve the capacity problem between London and Birmingham.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.0/4">I will go further and say that that route should be electrified, which could be done at a modest cost. If it was electrified, electric trains could run directly from Birmingham Snow Hill&#8212;and, indeed, from Birmingham airport and elsewhere&#8212;into the City of London, Canary Wharf and beyond via a link to Crossrail at Old Oak Common.</p>

	<p pid="a.1145.1/1">My constituency neighbour is a renowned expert on the railways. Would his proposal cost less than HS2? Does he have a figure for it?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-31a.1145.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="1145"  time="014:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#131031-0003.htm_spnew69">
	<p pid="a.1145.2/1">My railway expert friends tell me that the electrification of that line would cost about &#163;500 million and that the track work that would be required at Old Oak Common to link it to Crossrail would cost about &#163;10 million. We are talking about tiny amounts of money in comparison with HS2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.2/2">There could also be a direct link to Heathrow for the electric trains, which would go off at Greenford and on to the Great Western main line. That would link to</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.2/3">Heathrow at one end and to Crossrail at the other. Trains would be able to go from Heathrow to Birmingham airport or the centre of Birmingham, as well as from Canary Wharf to the centre of Birmingham. That would double the capacity between London and Birmingham very easily. The line could even go on to Stratford and there could be a transfer&#8212;although perhaps not an easy one&#8212;to the channel tunnel rail link and to Eurostar. That would solve the only real capacity problem, because the others involve train frequencies. My railway engineer and signalling friends say it is easy to run more trains, but the problem is that franchisees of privatised railways like crowded trains. It is more profitable to run crowded trains than half-empty trains, so if as many people as possible are crammed on to fewer trains, more profit is made.</p>

	<p pid="a.1146.0/1">The hon. Gentleman talks about capacity between London and Birmingham, but HS2 addresses capacity around Birmingham. Commuter traffic has increased by about 20% in and around Birmingham&#8212;a capacity issue that HS2 will address. It is not just about capacity between London and Birmingham.</p>

	<p pid="a.1146.1/1">I would like to explore the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s argument further. I would have thought that was a local transport matter and that we need more investment in local transport, not HS2.</p>

	<p pid="a.1146.2/1">The development of HS2 will free up capacity on the west coast main line and on the radial routes serving Birmingham. That is an important benefit of increasing capacity with HS2.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-31a.1146.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="1146"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#131031-0003.htm_spnew73">
	<p pid="a.1146.3/1">I am convinced that elsewhere on the network train frequencies and train paths are the problem. We have far too few trains on the existing network, and we could run many more trains much more quickly. The only real tight capacity is between London and Birmingham. Beyond that it is not difficult.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146.3/2">I do not want to speak for too long, but I want to mention other routes. In 1990, British Rail ran a test train from London to Edinburgh on the east coast main line. They cleared the line of everything else, ran the train straight through with a two-minute stop at Newcastle, and did the journey in three and a half hours&#8212;two minutes faster than the original time proposed for HS2.</p>

	<p pid="a.1146.4/1">Is not the answer to my hon. Friend&#8217;s objection the fact that, as he said, they cleared the line of everything else? The point is that we cannot just clear the line of everything else.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-31a.1146.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" speakername="Kelvin Hopkins" colnum="1146"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#131031-0003.htm_spnew75">
	<p pid="a.1146.5/1">Perhaps my hon. Friend will allow me to continue. Clearing the lines is obviously not possible all the time, but upgrading the line so that we can have through trains is not difficult. [Hon. Members: &#8220;It is!&#8221;] I have specifics. We need to double the viaduct north of Welwyn, and four-track the line between Huntingdon and Peterborough. We need flyovers at Peterborough and Newark, and we could then have non-stop trains straight through to Edinburgh if we wished. The train would have to slow down at Newcastle and York, but by and large the journey could be done in three and a half hours maximum. That is the east coast main line.</p>
	<p pid="a.1146.5/2">As we know, the midlands main line is going to be electrified, and we also want it to improve. With some track remodelling at Leicester and Derby we could make the trains run faster there. We need to straighten out the line at Market Harborough and restore the straighter line that used to exist, and we must take freight traffic off those three lines. That is the key to more train paths, because if we can take all the freight off those lines, we will not have a problem. To do that, however, we need an alternative. We have such an alternative in GB Railfreight, which I have been promoting for some years together with colleagues from the railway industry. We have a detailed scheme, carefully worked out and costed, to build a dedicated freight line from the channel tunnel to Glasgow, linking all the main conurbations of Britain, and capable of taking lorries on trains. We need to take freight off the road&#8212;and off the main lines, of course, but 80% of freight travels by lorry, not by container or other means. To get lorries on trains is crucial to modal shift, and to do that we need a gauge capacity that is capable of taking lorries on trains.</p>

	<p pid="a.1147.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is incredibly generous in giving way a second time. Will he say why he feels that his proposal&#8212;which, knowing his interest in this subject over many years, I have no doubt is well thought out and accurate&#8212;has not been considered? Why is HS2 on the drawing board if the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s proposal is less invasive and more cost effective?</p>

	<p pid="a.1147.1/1">I thank the hon. Lady&#8212;my close neighbour&#8212;for her question. We took a team of 15 people, including rail constructers, and representatives from Eurotunnel and the supermarkets, to meet Geoff Hoon when he was Secretary of State for Transport. It was clear they were worried that our scheme might conflict with HS2, not because it would take up the same track, but because it might remove freight from the railway lines and make the case for HS2 weaker. We argued that HS2 could go ahead if it was thought essential, but that a GB freight route is much more vital to Britain&#8217;s economy than HS2 has ever been. What is the total cost of the scheme? A generous figure, based on outturn costs for HS1, would, we think, be less than &#163;6 billion&#8212;a tiny fraction of HS2.</p>

	<p pid="a.1147.2/1">The hon. Gentleman has mentioned various lines, links between the west coast and east coast main lines and so on, but he has not mentioned the Trent Valley spur on the west coast main line, on which Nuneaton station in my constituency sits. That is an extremely important junction, and the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s proposals will not do anything to help capacity there or improve fast services from Nuneaton, which HS2 would do.</p>

	<p pid="a.1147.3/1">I think I mentioned that on other lines there is no problem with capacity, provided we are prepared to increase train frequencies. We do not do that, however, because it is not profitable to do so while private franchisees can make more profit by running fewer trains with more people on them&#8212;very simple. The rest of the railway network clearly needs heavy investment, and Network Rail is undertaking a lot of that. This specific scheme would solve many problems</p>
	<p pid="a.1147.3/2">and be a fraction of the cost of HS2. Indeed, upgrading the other lines I have suggested would solve almost all the capacity problems that we are now facing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1147.3/3">I am a passionate believer in railways, but if we are serious about them we must invest in dedicated rail-freight capacity, as I have suggested. At the moment the continent of Europe is building large rail-freight capacity right across the continent; indeed, trains can go from China to Europe even now. We will miss out on that if we cannot transport lorries on trains. We must be able to put lorry trailers on trains, or we will not see a shift from road to rail and the rest of Europe will leave us behind. For the sake of our economy, we must invest heavily in dedicated rail freight that is capable of taking lorries on trains.</p>

Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> who has obviously thought the issue through. Some of his proposals are quite interesting, but the fact of the matter is that the success of privatisation and competition means that we will need the capacity&#8212;we might need the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s suggestions on top of HS2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1148.0/2">I will support amendment 17, and I thank Ministers for finally including the Y route in the Bill. Two years ago when this scheme was first suggested, there was a great debate between Ministers and civil servants about whether we should build a line just to Birmingham, and a separate one to Manchester and Leeds. I am really grateful to Ministers that the Bill includes London to Birmingham, East Midlands, Sheffield, Leeds and Manchester. I would of course suggest that the left side of the Y could be built faster and quicker, and would be far better, and I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase> that we need to look seriously at the connection. International business men and foreign tourists will want to get on trains in Europe, bypass London and go straight beyond Manchester on to the spur to get to central, rural Lancashire and see the delights available. The sooner we can get that done, the better.</p>

Does he accept that the benefit of the reduction in journey time to Preston is one of the best in the plans for the area?

	<p pid="a.1149.2/3">Another issue is the north-south balance. People in some areas of the north ask why we are spending that money. I am grateful for what appears to be an outbreak of political consensus. Some Government Members and some northern Members were worried that the consensus would break down, but from what right hon. and hon. Opposition Members have said today, it looks like the consensus is restored, for which I am grateful.</p>

	<p pid="a.1149.4/1">I am tempted to go down that line, but, given the outbreak of consensus, I will stick with that. To be fair, northern MPs of every party have sat on the all-party parliamentary group on rail in the north, and fought together to get the northern hub from the Government&#8212;an &#163;800 million completed deal. They have fought together for electrification of the connection between Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield. Southern</p>

	<p pid="a.1150.1/1">I would assume nothing less, having worked with the hon. Gentleman and fellow northern MPs to get that extra investment. To be fair, the Government have delivered in the non-high speed section across the piece. In my small patch, they have agreed to electrification from Blackpool to Preston. Only a few months ago, nearly &#163;1 million was spent on Lancaster station to enable trains to turn round. All those improvements are happening as I speak. They are all part of the connectivity in the Bill, which provides preparatory expenditure for the</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.1/2">&#8220;network referred to in subsection (1)&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.1/3">and expenditure on the network that</p>

	<p pid="a.1150.1/5">For me, and for parts of the north where the high-speed rail will not reach, that is the key to our support for the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1150.1/6">I am grateful for the cross-party support, but some hon. Members rightly have concerns in their constituencies. I ask them to look at the proposals in the context of the north-south situation. Currently, it seems to my constituents that, when London demands something, things suddenly happen. Perhaps that is an exaggeration, but Crossrail cost &#163;16 billion, and nearly &#163;6 billion has been spent on Thameslink&#8212;we will take its second-class trains, which will apparently be marvellous for us.</p>

	<p pid="a.1151.1/1">A number of amendments in the group deal with the extension of HS2 to Scotland. Unsurprisingly, I shall concentrate my remarks on the case for the building of HS2 and the benefits it will bring to Scotland and my city of Edinburgh.</p>
	<p pid="a.1151.1/2">It is patently clear that the improvement to the railway system that HS2 will deliver will benefit Scotland. At the moment, we suffer from capacity problems further south on the rail network. Unless something is done to deal with them, as rail demand increases, journey times and railway services to Scotland will be affected. We will obviously benefit from the reduction of 45 minutes that will be brought about by HS2, and I hope that further reductions will be achieved in the fullness of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1151.1/3">We will also benefit from the way in which HS2 will help to rebalance the economy towards the north of Britain. The development of HS2 will also lead to a reduction in the pressure for growth in domestic air travel, which will have other advantages. Extending high-speed rail to the points proposed by HS2 and beyond will also improve the business case for high-speed. All the evidence suggests that the business case for the improvements further south will be strengthened by extending HS2 to the points currently provided for and beyond to Scotland as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.1151.3/1">I did not hear those comments. Front Benchers will put forward the Labour position on the matter, and I am pleased that this high-speed rail project was started under the Labour Government of which Lord Prescott was a member.</p>
	<p pid="a.1151.3/2">The case for HS2 is overwhelming, and that is why we have seen a wide degree of political consensus across the parties in Scotland and certainly in my city.

	<p pid="a.1151.5/1">Interestingly, in Scotland, it is not only those communities and councils that would directly benefit from the high-speed line that are in favour. Communities further north recognise that, although they might not get a direct benefit, it would still be</p>
	<p pid="a.1151.5/2">beneficial overall to the Scottish economy. That is the kind of constructive approach that other communities not directly served by the line should note and use as the basis for their approach to the development of HS2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1151.5/3">One of my concerns was the possible temptation to extend the line as far as Birmingham and never any further north. I therefore welcome the commitment in the Bill to go further north in England and the possibility that the line will go even further than outlined in the HS2 documents. I will look for any commitment for high-speed rail to go beyond the current terminus points for HS2. I would also ask why we have to accept a 20-year programme for high-speed rail to go from London to York and somewhere near Wigan when other countries seem to manage to do it much faster than we do. I hope that that issue can be addressed in the preparations for the scheme over the next few months and years.</p>

	<p pid="a.1152.1/1">I am grateful for that update, which has been circulating over the last hour or so as the information has reached the public domain. I presume that Baroness Kramer will not announce that high-speed is coming to Scotland, but I am looking forward to some positive announcements tomorrow. There is an opportunity here for the Scottish Government&#8212;of whatever colour, as we are obviously talking about a long-term process&#8212;to work with the UK Government. It is recognised that it will be possible to do some work on high-speed rail in Scotland, perhaps to link Edinburgh and Glasgow but also to provide the basis for a route further south. Although we cannot immediately have a high-speed route all the way from Edinburgh and Glasgow to London, other sections of high-speed rail would certainly benefit the Scottish economy. Just as the business case for high-speed rail further south is strengthened by bringing into it business from Scotland, any high-speed rail in Scotland that would bring passengers into the GB-wide high-speed system would be beneficial for the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.1/2">I understand why those communities that will not be served directly by the line, especially those that currently have a good rail service, will be concerned that they could lose out as a result of HS2 being constructed. The answer for those communities is to engage as actively as they can with central Government and neighbouring local authorities to try to ensure that they put the case to get the best benefits. It is also important that connectivity is examined, the point of the amendment tabled by my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.1/3">It is important for the Government, and for Front Benchers of all colours, to use the opportunity of developing HS2 to rebuild the vision for rail in the country as a whole. HS2 is not just a question of trains running on the high-speed line and then going no further; they can serve other destinations in the way they will serve Edinburgh and Glasgow. On the continent, high-speed trains do not just run on high-speed lines; they serve other communities too. That is something we should aim for in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.1/4">The case for high-speed developments beyond HS2 is powerful. I understand why a Government would not want to start putting down lines on a map to other parts</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.1/5">of Britain, because that would set off scare stories about costs, but the points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the right hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase> on possible development should not be lost or forgotten&#8212;the lines to Scotland and routes to the north-east of England in particular. There are clear capacity problems between Yorkshire and the north-east of England and they will need to be on the agenda at some stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1152.1/6">I started my comments by referring to the amendments on Scotland. The amendments tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40413" name="Angus MacNeil">the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil)</phrase> are superfluous. The Scottish Government have accepted the Bill in its current form. The Scottish Parliament has passed the relevant Sewel motion endorsing the proposals in the Bill. I do not always agree with the current Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament, but on this occasion if it is good enough for them, it should be good enough for this House. I will not support the amendments, as they do not take the debate any further. We have good proposals that have achieved broad consensus across the House. I hope we can continue to proceed in that fashion.</p>

As the list of presents she was hoping to receive grew ever longer, I had to remind her that we did not have a magic money tree in the garden. Her response, quick as a flash, was to say, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you plant one?&#8221; When we look at amendment 17 and consider the remarks at the beginning of the debate from the Chair of the Transport Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40370" name="Louise Ellman">the hon. Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman)</phrase>, we need to reflect on the reality of a budget set at &#163;42.6 billion&#8212;this seems to be used interchangeably with the spending envelope, albeit that it appears to have now grown to a &#163;50 billion cap&#8212;that does not include the changes in design referred to in the powerful speech from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1153.0/3">I want to draw hon. Members&#8217; attention to the remarks that David Prout made to the Public Accounts Committee. One might have expected the contingency to have anticipated changes in design costs. Of the &#163;50 billion cap, &#163;21 billion is currently unspecified. More than &#163;14 billion includes dealing with optimism bias and risk inflation&#8212;the initial 10% on that &#163;15 billion figure&#8212;and then on top of that there is a further contingency of more than &#163;4 billion for phase 1. Nowhere do the figures address changes to design, yet many of hon. Members&#8217; remarks have been based on exactly that premise. I predict there will be public campaigns in Camden where people will say, &#8220;If we are going to have High Speed 2, let us connect it to High Speed 1 in a far better way.&#8221; Dare I say it, but there may be one or two well-connected opinion-formers in north London who will help that campaign. Yet David Prout said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1153.0/4">&#8220;The contingency would not include major changes in scope, for example, that the Select Committee might require. If the Select Committee requires an additional station&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1153.0/5">as some in Sheffield are hoping for&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1153.0/6">&#8220;that is not included in the contingency. If it required 20 more miles of tunnelling&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1153.0/7">as the people of east Cheshire are hoping to secure&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1153.0/8">&#8220;that is not included in the contingency. What we would expect to include in the contingency are the more minor adjustments in Select Committee to mitigate environmental impact.&#8221;</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40634" name="David Mowat">the Member for Warrington South (David Mowat)</phrase> highlighted the issues involved, but let us consider, for example, the Heathrow spur, on which we have had interventions. If Howard Davies decides to go with a hub airport at Heathrow&#8212;and one would think it logical for HS2 to connect to it&#8212;the cost of that is not in this budget, and neither is the cost of the connection in Camden, so the cost of tunnelling and the additional work that is likely to flow are not in these figures either. I wish, then, to draw the House&#8217;s attention to the pressure that is likely to follow from what Donald Rumsfeld would probably refer to as the &#8220;known unknowns&#8221;, which we know are going to be huge.</p>

	<p pid="a.1154.6/1">My hon. Friend is listing all the items that are not included but which will add to the price of this project. The Government have now indicated their intention to accept the official Opposition&#8217;s amendment. I have been looking at some paperwork, and I believe that the cycling lanes in Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds will add up to another &#163;750,000; the light rail construction, if it goes ahead, in Liverpool and Birmingham will cost about &#163;1.6 billion; and if there is a walking programme for the seven cities, that will cost about &#163;750,000. Those projects are all in the infrastructure pipeline, so we are looking at adding between &#163;3 billion and &#163;4 billion just to provide the connectivity to which the Government have agreed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1155.0/1">My right hon. Friend makes a valid point. Inevitably, when large sums are being spent, there will be pressure to leverage it, and already the Government have signalled some tipping towards schemes linked to HS2. For example, they have referred to making cities &#8220;HS2 ready&#8221;, so it is in the very lexicon they are using.</p>

	<p pid="a.1155.1/1">On a point of clarification about connectivity, local authorities have to take some responsibility as part of their transport plans. The Greater Birmingham and Solihull local enterprise partnership&#8217;s top priority is to make a bid to the single regeneration pot for light rail connections to Birmingham airport and the interchange station. When Lord Adonis was promoting high-speed rail, and we were not sure about it in the west midlands, the deal was basically that we would find the funds to build the station. There is a balance between local authority spend and other pots; it should not all come from a single resource.</p>

	<p pid="a.1155.2/1">My right hon. Friend makes a fair point, but it is not the point that I am seeking to make. The &#163;35 billion that has been allocated for control period 5, between 2014 and 2019, referred to in paragraph 18 of the Department&#8217;s case, does not cover many of the items on the wish-lists that Members are compiling today.</p>

	<p pid="a.1155.3/1">I totally agree with my hon. Friend&#8217;s analysis: there will be increased pressure on the HS2 mitigation budget for the route, which will put costs up. I put it to him that the only way in which any Government will be able to keep a cap on the cost of HS2 will be drastically to cut back on the compensation scheme for householders who are unduly affected by the project. That would be devastating for my constituents.</p>

	<p pid="a.1155.4/1">I will come to the direct costs in a moment, but my hon. Friend makes a valid point. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors has told me that land prices have gone up by threefold in the past decade. Not many households have been compensated so far, but the House of Commons Library informs me that 32 homes have been compensated to date&#8212;a very modest sample&#8212;and that the average cost per home has been &#163;500,000. I do not know what the cost will be in north London, but I suspect that London house prices are going up quite quickly.</p>

	<p pid="a.1155.5/1">I would not wish to compete with my hon. Friend&#8217;s clear expertise in this matter, but has he considered reducing the budget for HS2 by using Old Oak Common as a terminus, thereby avoiding any of the activity in the Camden area that appears to be causing concern financially? That would fit with many European models, in which the terminus is situated outside the city centre and connected to the high-speed and cross-borough links. Has my hon. Friend considered that possibility as part of his investigation?</p>

	<p pid="a.1155.6/1">My hon. Friend is a fellow Lancastrian, and he is a great champion for his constituents. Surely one of the difficulties with opting for out-of-town stations is that it would take people longer to get to where they needed to be. The clue is in the name: high-speed rail. If</p>
	<p pid="a.1155.6/2">they travelled to an out-of-town station, they would still need to get into the city centre to complete their door-to-door journey.</p>

	<p pid="a.1156.0/1">This is a good opportunity to remind Members that the point of HS2 is to allow people to get to the areas of greatest economic activity, and those are not necessarily within five minutes of Euston station. The benefit of a terminus at Old Oak Common would be an ability to transfer quickly to the City, where the bulk of the economic activity takes place. This is the clear message from all high-speed rail networks around the world.</p>

	<p pid="a.1156.1/1">Of course there is a debate around Old Oak Common, but I must point out the lack of clarity. Clearing a similar site for the Olympics cost &#163;1 billion. Where is the figure for clearing and regenerating the site around Old Oak Common? Transport for London is putting in requests, stating that it is possible to leverage HS2 with better connectivity using Old Oak Common, and I think it is right to do so, but where is that proposal reflected in the figures?</p>
	<p pid="a.1156.1/2">The Chief Secretary to the Treasury made a clear statement on &#8220;The Andrew Marr Show&#8221; on Sunday. He did not say that the project would be delivered for &#163;42 billion; he said that it would be delivered for less. That was the promise he made. Now we are talking about a cap of &#163;50 billion, so an extra &#163;7 billion has appeared in the space of a few days. In today&#8217;s debate, Members are adding their own wish-lists, which will add further to the costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1156.2/1">The cost of HS2 is &#163;42.6 billion, within which there is a contingency fund of &#163;14.4 billion. The figure of &#163;50 billion that my hon.

	<p pid="a.1156.3/1">The size and quantum of the contingency points to a lack of detail and of financial discipline in the cost estimates. That is why so much of it is vague.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156.3/2">I started my remarks believing that my time was unlimited, but having been made aware by one of my colleagues that my time is more finite than I originally expected, I shall dramatically shorten my speech and finish with reference to two issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1156.3/3">First, on direct costs, reading the business case put forward this week, it is difficult to get a sense of the impact of energy prices on construction. We justified the high cost of our nuclear deal last week on the basis of rising energy prices, yet we seem to be quoting the same HS1 energy costs for steel construction for this project. Land prices seem vague. Network Rail still has a 23% efficiency gap. Is it to be a subcontractor? Are we going to fix the governance of Network Rail, which is still out of the scope of shareholders, of the National Audit Office and of freedom of information requests?</p>
	<p pid="a.1156.3/4">Secondly, there seem to be a number of contradictions with this project. If economic growth is as good as the passenger forecasts suggest, will it not put pressure on supplier costs for construction, particularly on a project that will deliver at its peak 40% of construction market work? We need far more transparency on costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1157.0/1">It may interest the hon. Gentleman to know that about 220 households in my constituency will need to be re-housed at the expense of HS2. The authorities were rather shocked to discover that a one-bedroom flat in a block recently built in the locality is currently going for &#163;482,000. Most of the people who need to be re-housed need a family-sized flat.</p>

	<p pid="a.1157.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman brings great expertise to these issues. That takes me back to the reference to a blank cheque: my concern is that the House is being asked to exercise blind faith, which will have a hugely distorting effect on transport schemes elsewhere in the country&#8212;as pressure grows, for example, for Crossrail 2 to connect not at Tottenham Court Road, but at Euston. Other schemes in the system, such as the one in my area of Cambridgeshire, will be asset-stripped of what they rightly deserve.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.1/2">Let me leave the House with the image that we look like someone coming down the platform with five business cases, while the train has already left the station and we are waiting for the announcement of whether we will hit our destination, which will be given next year not by the Government, but by the shadow Chancellor. I do not think that is the right way to proceed. We need to be far more careful with controlling the costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.1158.0/8">In amendment 20, I have sought to provide the cap that everyone is talking about. I had expected Labour Members to table such an amendment, and I am surprised that they did not, because they have made much of the fact that they will not give this project a blank cheque, and that the expenditure can go only so far and no further. Amendment 25&#8212;which I think the Government are minded to accept, as two Conservative Members have added their names to it&#8212;is limited to some financial reporting, and some crystal ball-gazing on the effect that an underspend or an overspend would have. It reminds me rather of &#8220;The Merchant of Venice&#8221; in many ways. I think that the Labour party has bottled out completely and remains sitting on the fence, and I do not think that people will forgive it for that.</p>

I do not agree that compensation will suffer. The Government seem perfectly capable of paying compensation with or without this Bill. The sum of compensation paid to date is &#163;52 million, so I think that that is irrelevant to whether this Bill goes through or not. I worry greatly about that, but the genesis of this project is the fact that in March 2010 the cost for the whole route was &#163;30 billion; by February 2011 it had risen to &#163;33 billion; by January 2012 it had risen to &#163;33.4 billion; and we are now at &#163;42.6 billion without the rolling stock being included.</p>

	<p pid="a.1160.10/1">I do not think there is anything wrong with this amendment at all. It was a probing amendment, and just as the Government managed to slip their name</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.10/2">under the official Opposition&#8217;s leading name on one amendment, I hoped that the Opposition might slip their name under mine it contains the cap they wanted. Also, if we had had some adjustments to this Bill, it would have encompassed the spend. If we are going to have a money Bill, it should not just cover the open-ended preparatory work&#8212;now my right hon.

	<p pid="a.1160.10/4">Well, we know the hybrid Bill is coming. It will be a gargantuan monster of a Bill that will take up more time in this House than any other Bill has ever done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.10/5">Amendment 15 seeks to restrict the preparatory expenditure. I am sure my Front-Bench colleagues will say that these amendments are contradictory, but they are probing amendments. I did not serve on the Bill Committee so this is the opportunity for me to get these matters discussed. I think we need to restrict the expenditure to those items that are on the face of the Bill. Currently, the word &#8220;includes&#8221; in clause 1(3) means that the Bill is the blank cheque to which I referred earlier. I think that, in the Bill&#8217;s current form, there is no restriction. I am sure the Government will not accept any restriction, but they would have been in a much better place if they had done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.10/6">I shall move on now, as I know many other Members want to speak. There are colleagues who are not in the House today but whom I have consulted in Buckinghamshire. The Attorney-General, my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40065" name="Dominic Grieve">the Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Grieve)</phrase>, knows his residents at Denham are wholly opposed to this proposal, and I know that the Minister for Europe, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40051" name="David Lidington">the Member for Aylesbury (Mr Lidington)</phrase>, is continuing to work tirelessly within Government to put to the most senior Ministers the arguments and interests of his constituency. He has asked me to point out today that there are serious mitigation issues both in Wendover and Aylesbury that are still not resolved, yet the Department&#8217;s current plans make no adequate provision either for the measures to reduce noise or for fair compensation. I am also concerned for Mr Speaker, whose constituents in Buckingham continue to express overwhelming opposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.10/7">This money Bill writes a blank cheque for the Government, or it purports to write a blank cheque and give the Government a fig leaf to cover their embarrassment about the hundreds of millions they have already spent and the &#163;1 billion they will spend by the time we reach the next election. I was, however, hoping that we could regularise some of the terms and conditions of the people working on this project, which is the aim of amendments 21 and 22.</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.10/8">Amendment 21 deals with payments made through service companies. I do not know how many people in this House pay close attention to this matter, but there has certainly been a lot of fuss about service companies, particularly in connection with the BBC and others. When I asked a fairly innocuous parliamentary question, I was surprised to find out that in the past 12 months HS2 Ltd has engaged 48 people paid through personal service companies. Apparently, eight of those people have either left the company or transferred to the payroll, and a further 12 will have left or transferred by <phrase class="date" code="2013-12-31">31 December</phrase>. That means that there will still be many people who are paid through personal service companies. Apparently,</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.10/9">the Department was carrying out an assurance process at the time to ensure that all those people were compliant with their tax and national insurance obligations, and the good news is that the response was that they were&#8212;none was not compliant. But on a Government project of this sort, being paid for from the public purse, people should be paid as civil servants and they should not be in receipt of bonuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1160.10/10">Much has been made about bonuses in and around this House in connection with many other professions. MPs do not get a bonus, and neither would I be asking for one as an MP, but I was shocked to find that between 2011 and 2013 people in the Department for Transport, including people working on HS2 Ltd, have been paid bonuses of more than &#163;3 million between them. I admit that many of those bonuses will be small, but we should still put our money where our mouth is and the practice should cease. I also understand that HS2 Ltd, which was operating bonus schemes, is no longer doing so for its employees. I am pleased about that, because I do not think we can say one thing in one area of government and practise a different set of procedures in another.</p>

If we do not get to see those costs, the Government will be concealing the real cost of HS2, which should be taken into consideration.</p>

	<p pid="a.1163.4/1">I shall speak particularly to amendment 25, which has the support of my Front Bench and, I am pleased to say, of the Government as well. I was a member of the Cabinet in 2009 which first gave formal approval to HS2. That was endorsed in the run-up to the general election by all-party agreement. Although I have taken a close interest in the project ever since, I have seen nothing in the intervening period to persuade me to withdraw my support for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163.4/2">The case is clear. First, thanks to a dramatic increase in the usage of the railways in the past 15 years&#8212;I am very proud of Labour&#8217;s record&#8212;we face a situation where, for both freight and passengers, the existing lines cannot cope. As someone who for years has had to endure the west coast main line, I have to say that large sums of money were spent during that period&#8212;one of the reasons why there was so little electrification&#8212;on patch and mend to that line and on quadrupling the line in the Trent valley, with very little overall benefit. If folk in the House and outside think there is an alternative to HS2, they are right that there is, but it is a worse alternative, with more disruption and greater cost.</p>
	<p pid="a.1163.4/3">The second reason why I strongly support HS2 is that it will help to rebalance our economies. I have listened to some fancy arguments in the House, but among the fanciest are those that I have heard today and from colleagues in the Tea Room&#8212;that if we put in this investment, it will somehow suck more economic activity into London. It is worth turning that argument on its head or, as the Treasury likes to say, looking at the counterfactual. If that were the case, it would be</p>
	<p pid="a.1163.4/4">overwhelmingly an argument for reducing the capacity of the railways north-south and for slowing up the lines. It is simple nonsense.</p>

What we are talking about is &#163;42 billion until 2033, which works out at just over &#163;2 billion a year. That is a lot of money but, in the grand scheme of things, including infrastructure investment, it is not huge, particularly when compared with the massive amount of money that has rightly been put in by successive Governments to improve infrastructure in London and the south-east. I would be happy to support that, but it is time that the investment went elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="a.1164.5/1">I have certainly never wished to speak for my right hon. and noble Friend Lord Mandelson. All I can report as a matter of fact is that my right hon. and noble Friend was in the same Cabinet Room in 2009 when the project was endorsed. If he has had some reverse damascene conversion, it is for him to explain that, not me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.5/2">Let me turn to the issue of costs. I was chairman of the Cabinet Committee on the Olympics for its first four years. The first bid was put in at about &#163;2.5 billion and the ultimate cost came out at &#163;9 billion. Let me explain why there is no direct comparison. The bid was not based on the contingency but on a prayer that we would win it. Not a huge amount of effort was put into costing it because, frankly, very few people ever thought we would win. It was only after we had won on <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-06">6 July 2005</phrase> that the serious work began and led, quite properly, by the Treasury, we considered the contingencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.5/3">I say to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> that a contingency of such a size is sensible, because there needs to be an optimism bias. That was what was put into the budget for the Olympics by the man who is now Sir David Higgins, who turned that project around. Contrary to what was said by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase>, the Olympics as an infrastructure project came in not only on time, because it had to, but on budget. Those who are worried about a</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.5/4">blank cheque&#8212;any Chancellor or shadow Chancellor needs to be&#8212;should be reassured that Sir David Higgins is now in charge. I have every confidence in him, not only from his time running this operation and the Olympics, but from his time at Network Rail. He got costs down and took a close interest in the detail of the projects.</p>

	<p pid="a.1165.1/1">Not quite, I think. There were reasons for that, however, and for the contingencies. These are very large projects.

I do not criticise anybody who either holds or might hold the purse strings for wanting to ensure that we bear down on costs, but those on my Front Bench and the whole of the parliamentary Labour party, as has been made clear, support the project and the Bill. That is why, if a Division is called at 5 o&#8217;clock, we will be in the Lobby with the Government in support of the Third Reading of the Bill. Let me make that clear.

	<p pid="a.1165.5/1">I know about optimism bias contingency costs because I faced exactly the same situation when I chaired the Cabinet Committee for the Olympics. My initial reaction was the same as that of my hon. Friend and my right hon. Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras: &#8220;Why on earth are we building in a contingency reserve on this scale?&#8221; I got the Treasury officials in and cross-examined them&#8212;I bumped into one the other day who remembers it&#8212;but in the end I was convinced that what was proposed was prudent, to use an adjective that used to be owned by the Labour party, and still is. Contingency reserves of that size are sensible and realistic. Yes, the cost is &#163;42 billion, but that is over 20 years, so we are looking at a cost of about</p>
	<p pid="a.1165.5/2">&#163;2 billion a year, of which the optimism bias contingency reserve is about &#163;700 million. In my judgment, such things are manageable.</p>

	<p pid="a.1166.1/1">I must make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166.1/2">Of course I understand the concerns of Members on both sides of the House about their constituencies. Were I in their position, I would probably be voicing similar concerns. However, when the grand motorway schemes were being built across the country, including in the Chilterns&#8212;the M40 goes right through them&#8212;there was no parliamentary process of this kind at all. There were no private Bills; there were private inquiries and compulsory purchase orders, and on it went. Of course there was an argument about the exact route the M40 would take when it went through the escarpment out of the Chilterns and around Oxfordshire, but I do not recall any Member from Buckinghamshire standing up in the House recently to say that building it was a disaster, that the effect on biodiversity was terrible and that we should return the land to the way it was.</p>
	<p pid="a.1166.1/3">Had there been a parliamentary process for the M40, the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham can bet her life that such would have been the opposition in the Chilterns&#8212;I understand exactly why, because we are all concerned about our own back gardens, including me&#8212;that it would never have been built. However, that road, at far greater disruption to the area than any railway will ever cause, has brought benefits to her constituency and county. While she continues to pursue her constituency concerns, I hope that she also recognises that there is a national interest in rebalancing our economy and ensuring that people in the north can get to the south more quickly.</p>

Gentleman to rebalance the economy between the north and the south; I just do not think that HS2 is the way to do it. The M40 has of course brought benefits, but that does not mean that the damage that will be done to the environment by yet another breach of the area of outstanding natural beauty can be brushed aside, although it is quite obvious that he thinks that the suffering of my constituents and their businesses is a price worth paying.</p>

This Government are committed to raising skill levels and creating an environment for small and medium-sized enterprises to succeed. Amendment 26 would place an obligation on the Government to report on their progress in delivering those opportunities and to demonstrate what we mean when we say that HS2 is an engine for growth. I have always been convinced, as have many Members across the House, that we will be able to do that. HS2 is a generational scheme, and as such we need to make sure we have the right home-grown talent that allows us to deliver it. I am delighted that</p>

	<p pid="a.1168.1/1">I might be prepared to consider that. However, my hon.

	<p pid="a.1168.2/1">As I understand it, this Bill relates not only to phases 1 and 2 of current high-speed rail projects, but to phases 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of such projects at any time in the next 40 to 60 years. How could the Government of today restrict the amount of money available without knowing the value of money in 40 years&#8217; time?</p>

	<p pid="a.1168.3/1">My right hon. Friend is completely correct. This Bill is about the preparatory expenditure. It is also about not only phases 1 and 2, but the whole network as it may be conceived in the future. It would, therefore, be completely erroneous to restrict ourselves to a limit on preparatory costs, because we do not know the future extent of any network. That is also why I agreed with my right hon. Friend a moment ago that amendment 20 is unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.3/2">I know that the intention of my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham was to put a limit on expenditure and I understand why she wanted to do that, but the amendment does not explicitly address preparatory expenditure, which is what this Bill is about. I note that she said it was a probing amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1168.4/1">The Minister knows exactly what my intention was with my amendments. I will not press any of them to a vote, but what is worrying about the Bill is that it is not restricted in any way, shape or form. It is totally open-ended, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase> has just admitted, and this House has no control or say over what moneys will be spent on the preparation, and on the HS2 project itself.

	<p pid="a.1168.5/1">It is rare that I disagree with my right hon. Friend, but in this case I do. What this Bill does is explicitly place reporting obligations on the Government for the preparatory work. Moreover, it is the hybrid Bill, which my right hon. Friend has mentioned, that will provide the opportunity to scrutinise all stages and costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.5/2">We have created the reporting duty precisely to ensure that Parliament can scrutinise the expenditure and see that we are spending it responsibly. Planned expenditure on design works for the financial year 2013-14 is about &#163;2.5 million, and for 2014-15 it is about &#163;9.2 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.5/3">There are a number of other amendments in this group and I know that other Members want to get in. I sympathise with the spirit of amendment 8, but it does not clarify the exact level that most people recognise as the number of people employed by small and medium-sized enterprises. Moreover, it would restrict a small or medium-sized enterprise that had fewer employees, but that hoped to secure a high-value contract that would result in many UK jobs. The amendment goes beyond the direct nature of the contract.</p>

	<p pid="a.1169.1/1">On amendment 31 and the transparency of the project, I do not believe it is necessary to produce six-monthly reports of spending estimates in addition to the annual reports to which we have already committed.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40171" name="Christopher Chope">the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope)</phrase> would not want us to waste money or create bureaucracy just to produce six-monthly reports.

	<p pid="a.1169.3/1">The Government accept that we need to come to the House to explain our actions and report on our preparatory expenditure. As has been discussed extensively this afternoon, the initial target cost for phase 1 is &#163;17.16 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169.3/2">My right hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham has tabled amendments on the monitoring of tax avoidance and the payment of bonuses to those who work on High Speed 2. We must manage the costs, but we must balance that with ensuring that the staff reward arrangements attract the right talent. We need to ensure that those who work in the public sector demonstrate the highest standards of integrity and meet their tax obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169.3/3">Following the review of the tax arrangements of public sector appointees last year by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, all Departments and agencies have a duty to seek assurances about the tax arrangements of their long-term specialists and contractors to ensure that they are paying the right amount of tax. The Government are committed to tackling all forms of tax avoidance and have taken a wide range of measures to close tax loopholes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1169.3/4">It is essential that we guard against the payment of bonuses that are not in line with the Government&#8217;s goal of reducing the public sector remuneration package. However, we must ensure that we have the right reward structure in place. We must not put provisions in legislation that would tie the hands of the whole supply chain. I am happy to confirm to my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham that Sir David Higgins will move to High Speed 2 on the same salary</p>
	<p pid="a.1169.3/5">that he received at Network Rail and that he has guaranteed that he will not accept any bonuses. I hope that that satisfies her.</p>

Under this Government, the budget for HS2 has swelled from &#163;773 million to at least &#163;900 million in this Parliament. The botched design for Euston pushed the cost of that station from &#163;1.2 billion to &#163;1.6 billion, even though some of the features of the design were downgraded. The Government announced in June that, with a sizeable increase in contingency funding, the headline budget for the project had increased by &#163;10 billion to &#163;50.1 billion.</p>

	<p pid="a.1170.2/1">I am afraid that I am very short of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1170.2/2">That headline budget includes the costs of construction and procuring rolling stock. That is reflected in amendment 25, which I believe is superior to amendment 20, which has been proposed by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1170.2/3">In short, Ministers have failed to keep the costs under control. The rising budget for HS2 has damaged the public perception of the project. It is therefore vital that, under the incoming leadership of Sir David Higgins, financial discipline is imposed. The use of the project&#8217;s &#163;14.4 billion contingency fund must be minimised wherever possible. Ministers must ensure that Sir David Higgins has their full backing in that task.</p>
	<p pid="a.1170.2/4">Amendment 25 is designed to ensure that that happens. It will introduce a powerful mechanism to ensure that there is financial responsibility. It will force the Government to announce any overspend of the yearly budget. It will also provide an incentive to identify areas in which costs can be reduced, as was successfully done on the Crossrail project.</p>

	<p pid="a.1172.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">Let me begin by thanking all Members who served on the Public Bill Committee. In particular I thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>, not only for his work on the Bill, but also for the hard work that he put into the Department for Transport during his time there. It was a great pleasure to work with him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/3">For a project as important as this, everyone should have their say&#8212;indeed, it sometimes feels as if they do. At the same time, however, we need to move the debate forward, which is what the Bill does. This is the point at which the debate starts moving from &#8220;if &#8220; to &#8220;when&#8221;. The House has already voted overwhelmingly in favour of the principle of a new high-speed, high-capacity rail network. I hope it will do so again this evening because the decisions we take today will benefit our country for decades to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/4">Just this week, with the storms that hit the south and east, we have seen how crucial our railways are to national life. When trains are crowded and disrupted, life for hard-working people gets more difficult. That is why the new north-south line is not some expensive luxury.</p>

	<p pid="a.1172.3/1">I understand why the Secretary of State is reluctant to give way. Throughout the whole of this land, people are deeply disturbed by the manner in which the Bill is being rammed through. Furthermore, as he well knows, the arrangements he has described as benefits are not accepted by my constituents and many other people, nor by the many reports emanating from the Public Accounts Committee and others that demonstrate that HS2 is not a straightforward benefit, and is in fact quite the opposite.</p>

	<p pid="a.1172.4/1">I know my hon. Friend is not in favour of the new line&#8212;he loses no time in telling me that. I dare say that similar comments were made in debates on railways in the House over the centuries. The truth is that the line will be the first line built north of London in 120 years. I understand the concerns of hon. Members whose constituencies the line goes through. I do not dismiss them and have never done so. I want to ensure that we have a fair compensation scheme in place. I believe that the scheme is, without any doubt, right for the future of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.4/2">I find it rather ridiculous that I can go from London to Paris on a high-speed train, and that my hon. Friend can go from London to Brussels on a high-speed train&#8212;I know he keeps a close eye on what goes on there&#8212;but we cannot go from London to Birmingham, Manchester or Leeds on a high-speed train. The time has come for a steep uplift in our transport system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.4/3">I should tell my hon. Friend that there is still a long way to go. We must take the hybrid Bill through the Commons. There will be plenty of opportunities to</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.4/4">debate it in detail. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40090" name="Jack Straw">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.1173.3/1">My hon. Friend has taken part in the Third Reading of many Bills&#8212;they have always been hour-long debates. In fact, it is only recently that we have had debates on Third Reading. Back in the days when the right hon. Member for Blackburn was Leader of the House, we sometimes did not have debates on Third Reading because we simply did not have the time. The Government are trying to help everybody we can&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I do not want to get any more partisan now that I have the right hon. Gentleman on side.</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/2">The Bill is about helping communities and businesses, and helping the cities of the north and the midlands to compete on equal terms with London. Nobody begrudges the money we are spending on Crossrail or Thameslink. They are huge investments in our capital city, but it is time we looked at what is happening in the rest of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/3">Three important words&#8212;room for growth&#8212;sum up why the project is so important. They are at the core of the strategic case we published on Tuesday. The responses to the report show the crucial message of growth. The British Chambers of Commerce states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/4">&#8220;This report bolsters the economic case for HS2&#8230;HS2 is the only scheme that can transform capacity on Britain&#8217;s overstretched railways.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/5">The CBI has thrown its considerable weight behind the project. It did so because the new line is part of the answer to the infrastructure deficit that faces our country. The leaders of our great cities back HS2. Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester city council, has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/6">&#8220;It&#8217;s straightforward and simple. We need more capacity and the only way is through this new network.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/7">Since 2008, the country has learned some tough lessons, but we must make ourselves more resilient and competitive as an economy. That will not happen if we do not take the long-term decisions on investment and stick to them. Our society is changing, our population is growing, people are travelling more, and demand for inter-city rail travel has doubled in the past 15 years and will continue to increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/8">As I have said all along, I welcome suggestions for creating more capacity, but the so-called alternative suggestions from the critics simply do not add up. We have looked at the case for building new motorways and dramatically expanding domestic aviation. Neither does the job. Some people believe we can carry on squeezing more room out of our current railways, patching up our problems. The work we published this week shows that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/9">if we tried to create the capacity we needed by upgrading the three current main north-south lines, we would face 14 years of weekend closures. That is not an alternative to the new line, it is disruption on a nightmare scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/10">We are already investing record sums in the existing railway. Network Rail will spend &#163;38.3 billion in its next five-year control period, and the Government have a &#163;73 billion budget for wider transport investment over the next Parliament. Despite all that, we will still need new rail capacity. If one accepts that&#8212;and that we need room to grow&#8212;there is no choice about how to provide it. As the strategic case makes clear, a new high-speed north-south line is not just the right way, it is the only way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/11">The new north-south line will be the backbone of Britain. It will have 18 trains an hour, each carrying up to 1,100 passengers, transforming the available space on inter-city lines. As long-distance services transfer to the new line, capacity will be released on the existing network. Of course, not every city across Britain will benefit in the same way, but Network Rail estimates that more than 100 cities and towns could benefit from released capacity. It would mean significantly more commuter services, better connectivity and more routes for rail freight, taking lorries off our most congested roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/12">We know that HS2 is the best answer to our transport problems, but as with any large infrastructure scheme, we also know we will face opposition. I respect the fact that some people are concerned about the impact on the places they live, and I respect those with serious proposals for improvements. Already, the environmental impact of the new line has been vastly reduced thanks to such improvements. But I also respect what Sir John Armitt said in his recent report on infrastructure&#8212;that big schemes need &#8220;broad political consensus&#8221; as well as &#8220;resolution&#8221; from political leaders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/13">HS2 must be a national project with support across the parties, or in the end it will be nothing. Labour leaders in our great cities across the north and the midlands know that HS2 is right. To those who say that there is no blank cheque, I say that there never has been and there never will be. I know that hon. Members want costs controlled. Here are the facts. The target price for the first phase is &#163;17.16 billion. That is the price for construction agreed with HS2 Ltd. For the whole Y-route, the agreed budget is &#163;42.6 billion, including a contingency of &#163;14.4 billion, which we are determined to bear down on. Sir David Higgins&#8212;the man who built the Olympics on time and on budget&#8212;will make sure that happens. As the new chairman of HS2, he will bring his penetrating eye and expertise to the task to get the best value for our country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/14">As the strategic case published this week shows, our updated benefit-cost ratio has fallen slightly from 2.5 to 2.3. We have been open about that, but it means that the business case for the new north-south line is still strong, with more than &#163;2 returned for every &#163;1 invested&#8212;about the same as Crossrail and Thameslink, and nobody seems to doubt those projects. In fact, the ratio for HS2 could increase to 4.5 if rail demand continues to rise until 2049.</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/15">It is still important to recognise that the benefit-cost ratio cannot take account of unpredictable factors. That was true of the Jubilee line extension in London, for instance, which did not include the 100,000 jobs it now supports at Canary Wharf. It was true for</p>
	<p pid="a.1173.3/16">High Speed 1, which did not include benefits from redevelopment at King&#8217;s Cross and St Pancras. When I first became a Member of Parliament, King&#8217;s Cross and St Pancras were places where people did not want to spend any time if they could possibly get away with it. They would try to turn up just before their train was due to leave. Those stations are now destinations in their own right. People go there and look with amazement at what has happened to the UK&#8217;s railway system.</p>

	<p pid="a.1175.0/1">I represent not just St Pancras, but Euston and King&#8217;s Cross. Does the Secretary of State accept that virtually all the people in my constituency who are now opposed to HS2 were strongly in favour&#8212;indeed, the first advocates&#8212;of the transformation of St Pancras and the improvements at King&#8217;s Cross?</p>

	<p pid="a.1175.1/1">Of course I do. I am more than happy to meet the right hon. Gentleman to discuss the particular issue of Euston station, because the redevelopment will bring specific problems. But we must also ensure that we get the very best deal for his constituents in the redevelopment of Euston station. I am meeting the leader of Camden council next week, although I do not know if the right hon. Gentleman will be there. I do not discount the concerns of local residents about the work on major infrastructure projects, and we have to take them into account.</p>

	<p pid="a.1175.2/1">Last week it was disclosed that the Treasury had made a mistake and awarded Barnett consequentials to Wales in the 2015-16 spending round. Subsequently, the Treasury said it would claw the money back in the next spending review and that it did not set a precedent. Will the Secretary of State confirm that there will not be a clawback, that the precedent has now been set and that Wales will have the consequentials? Unless he does so, we will vote against him on Third Reading.</p>

	<p pid="a.1175.3/1">It would be a brave Secretary of State who started second-guessing the Treasury, and I will not do that now. I understand the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s representations and will bear them in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1175.3/2">I will briefly explain the next steps. We intend to submit the hybrid Bill before Christmas. In February, the growth taskforce reports. I know the challenges ahead, but also the opportunities. We are not here to patch up our railway once again, only to spend far more later when it turns out that we should have invested properly at the start. It will take determination to strengthen our country. I urge this house to support the Bill. It is our chance to get ahead and to invest in our long-term prosperity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1175.4/3">We support plans for a new north-south rail line, but we are clear that the Government must get a grip on the costs. High Speed 2 was the brainchild of Lord Adonis, the Labour Government&#8217;s last Transport Secretary. We understand that the railway is not needed just to tackle the rail capacity crunch that we face in the next ten years: managed properly, HS2 has the power to transform the economic geography of our country. It will build our great cities and bring them closer together. It will connect people to each other, to work and to leisure. It will help to rebalance the economy, creating and using our country&#8217;s manufacturing skills.</p>

	<p pid="a.1176.1/1">If the hon. Gentleman had listened, he would know that I just said we will support HS2. We shall be voting in favour of it this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.1/2">This is the first new north-south railway for more than 100 years, but Labour's brainchild has, sadly, been neglected by the Government. Instead of gestation, we have had stagnation. The project has been put at risk by delays, project mismanagement and, in July, by a huge increase to the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.1/3">First, on delays, Ministers looked at strategic alternatives to High Speed 2. That took until November 2011, which wasted 18 months and led to slippage in the project timetable, with Ministers now playing catch-up. Costs in this Parliament have risen from &#163;700 million to &#163;900 million. The National Audit Office has warned that this tighter time scale poses risks to the project:</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.1/4">&#8220;Faster preparation for the bill may increase the extent of petitions to Parliament which may make it less likely that royal assent is granted by the planned date of May 2015.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.1/5">Another delay is that the consultation on phase 2 of the route has only just been launched for the Y part of the network, despite the fact that it was being worked on when we were in power three years ago. Ministers have been trundling along; it is time for more urgency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1176.1/6">Secondly, on project mismanagement, the Government&#8217;s early cost-benefit reports were criticised in May this year by the National Audit Office for failing to make the strategic case for the new railway. I welcome that that has now been published in full. In September, the Public Accounts Committee warned that Ministers&#8217; plans to present the hybrid Bill to Parliament before Christmas were &#8220;ambitious&#8221; and &#8220;unrealistic&#8221;. I would be interested to hear from the Secretary of State whether that is still his plan.</p>

	<p pid="a.1176.3/2">Finally, this summer the contingency budget ballooned to &#163;14.4 billion, now one third of the railway&#8217;s cost. Our concern is that putting in such a large contingency at such an early stage of the project could be a self-fulfilling prophecy, a point made by my hon.

Prices have risen faster than wages for 39 of the 40 months of this Government, and working people are, on average, more than &#163;1,500 a year worse off. In these circumstances, and given the public finances, it was right for my right hon. Friend the shadow Chancellor to call the Government to account for their mismanagement of the project, which has led to this ballooning of costs. That is the right thing to do, because public consent for this great project depends on people like the shadow Chancellor having the courage to stand up against sloppy, incompetent and bureaucratic government. It is we, the Opposition, who are the true friends of HS2 and this Government who have put it at risk. We will continue our scrutiny of these costs and our discipline on the public finances.</p>

	<p pid="a.1177.0/1">My hon. Friend rightly draws attention to the problem of delay. Certainly in Sheffield, we are particularly concerned about the delay between completing phases 1 and 2. Now that the welcome appointment of Sir David Higgins has been announced, should not one of his jobs be to consider how we can build the second phase more quickly? Perhaps we could start building in the north as we start building in the south.</p>

	<p pid="a.1177.3/1">I do not know whether my hon. Friend was here when this was discussed, but we tabled an amendment on Report that was agreed by the Government and which makes it clear that any contingency spend must be reported to the House annually.</p>
	<p pid="a.1177.3/2">We will continue to hold up the weaknesses of the management of HS2 until every one of them has been addressed. We want to see swift progress with the hybrid Bill and we shall scrutinise the latest strategic case, published this week, to satisfy ourselves that it is based on sound assumptions. The Government must drive down those contingency costs and have a clear strategy for doing so. This fiscally disciplined scrutiny is what one would expect from any credible official Opposition seeing a Government desperately mismanaging a project. We will go ahead with the project, but the Government must bring down the costs, and the benefits to the nation must be clear. We say: get a grip on the project, get control of the budget and get it back on track.</p>
	<p pid="a.1177.3/3">The increase in rail usage during our time in government was a record to be proud of, but we now face serious challenges. We understand that current and future capacity constraints on the existing rail network place a brake on regional and city growth. We know that demand for rail</p>
	<p pid="a.1177.3/4">travel continues to grow, despite the tough economic times, and our support for a north-south line rests on tackling that capacity problem and supporting 21st century transport infrastructure. This week&#8217;s strategic case shows the intense pressure our major mainline stations are under, and not just in the south. In four years, there will be 200 people for every 100 train seats arriving into Birmingham New Street at 5 o&#8217;clock. Rail freight is growing at 3% a year, and HS2 would free up space for more freight trains on the east coast, west coast and midland main lines, and take those lorries off our roads.</p>

	<p pid="a.1178.0/1">As I said in my speech, if we want a serious transfer of freight on to rail, we must make it possible to transport lorries on trains, but we cannot do that on the existing network because the gauge is not big enough. We need a dedicated freight network for that to happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.1178.3/1">Okay, well perhaps we will park that thought for another day, because many others want to come in. My hon. Friend is absolutely right, though, that we have to shift freight from the roads and on to the more environmentally friendly railways, and we want ensure that this line can do that. We want HS2 to give people a real choice between short-haul aeroplanes and the more environmentally friendly trains. We want to see more inter-city services for cities that currently have a poor service to London. We want HS2 to free the west coast, east coast and midland main lines for new commuter services between the midlands and the north.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178.3/2">These are not just transport arguments. They are social and economic arguments about the sort of country we want to be: a country in which no town or city is left behind. We want to ensure that cities such as Wakefield, which currently enjoys a twice-hourly inter-city service to London, are not downgraded. I obviously have a particular interest in Wakefield&#8217;s twice-hourly service to London, which I am happy to declare.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178.3/3">The public consultation on compensation arrangements is important, and the Government need to ensure that they respond fully to specific local issues such as those raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the right hon. Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase>, and that proper compensation is given to residents who are affected or blighted, such as those in the constituency of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase>. We will maintain pressure on the Government to work closely with the communities affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178.3/4">We will vote today in favour of this paving Bill to allow preparatory expenditure on the scheme. We believe that how we build something is as important as what we build. This is not just a transport project; it is also a social and economic project. I am glad that the cities are already looking at how they can invest in skills so that local people can benefit from the employment opportunities that HS2 will bring. We are pleased that the Government have agreed to our amendments on vocational training audits for the scheme. That will help us to realise our Labour vision of creating 35,000 high-quality apprenticeships over the lifetime of the</p>
	<p pid="a.1178.3/5">project, representing a step change in vocational education for this country&#8217;s young people. HS2 is not just a transport project; it is also an employment project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178.3/6">We are glad that the Government have accepted our amendments on annual reports to Parliament on contingency spending to ensure that the scheme is kept on budget, and on linking the railway with active travel such as cycling and walking. Having said that, I will not make any promises about cycling the new cycle path that will run alongside the track. After cycling from London to Brighton, I think I know my limits. We will also continue to scrutinise Ministers to ensure that they work closely with UK companies to use procurement to deliver the maximum jobs, growth and skills for UK companies, small and large.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178.3/7">High Speed 2 is a huge project which, if managed properly, will bring great social, economic and environmental benefits to this country. The project is about how we deliver capacity for more passengers and services, and connectivity to bring cities closer together, while ensuring that the trains run on time. We will serve our great cities by having HS2 come in with a budget that is under control and with benefits that are clear for all to see. The Secretary of State that he should do his job and I will do mine, and my job is to ensure that he does his job properly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1178.3/8">High Speed 2 is a project that is in the national interest. It has suffered from the fiscal and project management incompetence of this Government, and I hope that this Secretary of State will get it back on track. Britain deserves better than this. It will fall to the next Labour government, a one-nation Government, to build HS2&#8212;on time, on budget and in the national interest.</p>

	<p pid="a.1179.0/1">I should like to congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40519" name="Robert Goodwill">the Member for Scarborough and Whitby (Mr Goodwill)</phrase>, on his new appointment and thank him for taking up the baton on the Bill on Report. That was not an easy task. He was preceded by an excellent Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>, who did a very good job in Committee. I really enjoyed the spirit of co-operation between both sides in Committee, and the latitude that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the right hon. Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> and I were given to table amendments that have genuinely improved the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179.0/2">Anyone who will have High Speed 2 going through their constituency is having a difficult time. Those who will have an interchange station will have what I have described as the pain and the gain. The quality of the local connectivity can tip the balance between pain and gain in those areas, and I am delighted that an amendment has been accepted on a cross-party basis to improve local connectivity. That will make a big difference to the constituencies that will have those stations. It will provide for local road, rail, cycle and pedestrian connections to the new interchange stations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179.0/3">The Birmingham interchange station will offer a rare opportunity to improve the already integrated international airport and its main line station, through a connection with high-speed rail. Seeing the potential for that, the airport has proposed a second runway, even though it</p>
	<p pid="a.1179.0/4">has plenty of spare capacity on its recently extended runway. It hopes, of course, to relieve some of the pressure on London and the south-east. With the interchange station being approximately 38 minutes from Euston, it is obviously competitive in terms of journey time with some of the London airports. This had led my local authority to see the potential of this transport hub, designating it as &#8220;UK Central&#8221;. HS2 is central to that vision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179.0/5">To fulfil that vision, I hope that the Department will be able to look at the design stage of the new junctions required on the M42, as it serves Birmingham airport, the present station and the National Exhibition Centre. We need help with that. It would be worth giving consideration, too, to the development of the surface area and perhaps take another look at providing a tunnel&#8212;I would very much like to see that&#8212;where HS2 crosses over the existing west coast main line.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179.0/6">I believe that the extra time the Government have given for this Bill has allowed important improvements and mitigations. The draft environmental statement was indeed a draft&#8212;one on which we could consult our constituents and seek to secure improvements. I am sure that my constituents and those of many other Members appreciate the value of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1179.0/7">Unfortunately, we did not reach my amendments today. They would have improved the terms of the compensation for all affected constituents and enshrined in statute a property bond. I am pleased that the Government are consulting on a property bond, and we have every hope that that will be brought to fruition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1180.0/1">I support my right hon. Friend in her search for a property bond. As she knows, my constituent Hilary Wharf, the railway economist, has done a great deal of work on the property bond issue, and believes this will be a much fairer way of compensating all those people whose lives and properties will be damaged by this project.</p>

	<p pid="a.1180.1/1">I agree with my right hon. Friend and I urge all Members whose constituencies are affected by HS2 to make sure that their constituents respond to the consultation that is under way; the Government remain open-minded about the eligibility criteria, which is important. I indicated in an intervention that there is an important need to offset the impact on biodiversity. I know that the present Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is working with HS2 to make sure that no net loss of biodiversity arises from the infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.1/2">For the west midlands, HS2 is a lifeline. We should not overlook the fact that, at a time when west midlands manufacturing is undergoing a renaissance for the first time in my generation, there is no capacity for transporting manufacturing products on our railways. Anyone driving down the M40 will see transporter load after transporter load of cars going for export. We export 82% of all the cars we produce, and 50% of them go to other EU countries. They should be able to be transported by rail. The freight aspect of HS2 is thus incredibly important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1180.1/3">Finally, in view of the completion date, this project is principally going to benefit our children and our children&#8217;s children. I would like us to be the generation with the foresight to provide for them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1181.0/1">I am going to be the original parochial MP. For many people in my constituency, this issue is not a question of &#8220;not in my back yard&#8221;, but one of &#8220;not through my front room&#8221;. A total of 220 homes will be destroyed and a further 1,000 homes will be blighted for the 10 years while the works go on at Euston. A large number of small businesses will be bankrupted because of what is going on there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/2">When it comes to getting compensation, both the qualifications and the quantum for compensation in Greater London, and most particularly at Euston and in Camden Town, are much worse and far inferior to what will apply in rural areas. I hope that some people in the House of Lords will see fit to help Ministers keep the promises they made about being fair to everybody in terms of compensation. There can be no justification for saying that the noise is less in Euston than in Great Missenden. Noise is noise, dirt is dirt, filth is filth. The main difference is that in Euston all that will go on for 10 years, whereas on most other parts of the line it will go on for only a short period.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/3">HS2 Ltd, and the HS2 apologists, say &#8220;Oh, it will not be as bad as Frank Dobson says.&#8221; Well, if the trouble will not be as bad as Frank Dobson says, why cannot those at HS2 come up with full, decent compensation? The main reason is that they know that it is going to be terrible and that proper compensation would cost a lot of money, but why should people living in my area experience dreadful blight for a decade or more while a national project goes through? Why should they be sacrificed on the altar of that national project?</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/4">It has been suggested that buildings in the area will act as buffers against noise. The people who live in Mornington terrace, the people who live in Ampthill square, the people who live in Park Village East, the people who live in Eversholt street, the people who live in the Regent&#8217;s Park estate, the people who overlook the railway now and the people who will overlook the railway when the &#8220;buffer&#8221; blocks of flats have been demolished&#8212;all those people face 10 years of noise and filth and disruption, and we are proposing that they should not receive the same level of compensation as people living in Great Missenden. That cannot be fair, and it cannot be decent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/5">I think that nearly everyone in the House wants to support and help small businesses. Drummond street, in my constituency, is full of small businesses with very hard-working owners and staff, providing restaurants and caf&#233;s and shops. It is on the west side of Euston station. The shopkeepers and restaurateurs have conducted surveys, and have found that between 40% and 70% of their trade is passing trade&#8212;people who are going to or from Euston to catch a train, the tube or a bus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/6">It is currently proposed that about a third of Drummond street will be demolished&#8212;which does not include any of the shops&#8212;that a huge fence will be built around the construction site for 10 years, and that there will no longer be any access to the west side of Euston station from Drummond street. Anyone trying to get from the shops and restaurants into the station will have a quarter-of-a-mile wander around the boundaries of the site. That means bankruptcy for the small businesses there which will lose their trade. Those businesses are already being damaged and blighted. The kitchens of one of the</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/7">restaurants are getting a bit past it, and the restaurant is thinking of replacing them, but there is no point in investing in that replacement. Let me say this to both Front Benches: do they seriously think it right to go ahead with this project and damage those little, ordinary citizens?</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/8">I raised this matter in the Committee, which took evidence from witnesses. When the problems in Drummond street were brought to the distinguished attention of the man who is the director general of the HS2 project at the Department for Transport, he gave his considered opinion of the Drummond street traders, saying</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/9">&#8220;Their business will develop. We hope that businesses in Drummond street will benefit from the construction workers on the HS2 site.&#8221; <i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, High Speed Rail (Preparation) Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2013-07-11">11 July 2013</phrase>; c. 154, Q292.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/10">Does he seriously think that some construction worker, knackered and stopping for his snack break, will walk a mile to and from Drummond street to get food? No is the answer to that, but what is worse, had this great person inquired of the traders in Drummond street, they would have confirmed to him that a major construction site nearby had supplied them with no single remembered user during their lunch breaks. This, I have to say, is someone who works for the outfit which has been promoting HS2 until now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/11">As I have said to the Secretary of State and his predecessors, if I was in favour of this hare-brained scheme, I would get rid of a lot of the people involved, because in my constituency alone their original estimate of the costs has proved to be &#163;1 billion less than their revised costs. That is &#163;800 million extra at Euston and &#163;125 million for running the works across Camden town, where, apparently, the cost went up from &#163;170-odd million to &#163;300 million because they had not realised they would need to widen the track. If that reflects the quality of thought and advice, I say to those people who are in favour of this scheme, &#8220;Watch it, because it&#8217;s a mess, and even the great man who, at the Olympics, did manage to spend the contingency fund is going to have difficulty sorting it out.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1181.0/12">I therefore have to say that I believe it will be necessary for the House of Lords to try to look after and properly compensate the people I try to represent. At the last general election I made two promises. I promised I would try to stop HS2 happening and, failing that&#8212;this was a twin-track approach, if people will excuse the expression&#8212;I said I would try to make sure all their interests were looked after. I have great belief in the integrity of the current Secretary of State, and if he is going to discharge his promise to look after people properly and treat them fairly, he will have to deal properly with the people I have been trying to represent.</p>

However, my constituents can rest assured that I will be raising those concerns inside the Chamber, outside the Chamber, and in any way I can. I and the other two Members of Parliament for Hillingdon&#8212;we like to be regarded as the three musketeers, &#8220;one for all, and all for one&#8221;&#8212;will be raising these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1182.0/5">Voting for this Bill tonight does not mean I will be giving a green light to the whole project. There is still some way to go for me to be persuaded that the pros outweigh the cons, and I shall be looking at things very seriously. But one thing I would say is that if there is one person in this Chamber who can persuade me of that, it is the Secretary of State.</p>

	<p pid="a.1183.0/1">Sedgefield has a particular place in the history of railways, as it was in a place in Sedgefield, Heighington crossing, that Locomotion No.1 was assembled by George Stephenson in 1825, on its route to Darlington to open up the Darlington and Stockton railway. It was said at the time that such was the velocity that in some parts the speed was frequently 12 mph, but it still took 65 minutes to travel the eight and a half miles to Darlington from Heighington crossing. Obviously we have come on a long way since then, but there is still a long way to go, which is why I support the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183.0/2">I wish to talk a little about supply chains and how this project will have an impact on jobs. Hitachi is opening a factory in my constituency which is going to build the intercity express programme trains, and the Secretary of State is coming to the constituency tomorrow to celebrate the start of construction there. That is just one example of what impact this will have on factories in areas that, in the first instance, are not affected by high-speed rail, because the route will not be going through the north-east initially. We are talking about 730 jobs, with 3,000 to 5,000 jobs in the supply chain. We also have a new university technology college opening. Hitachi and other companies in Newton Aycliffe are in negotiations with Sunderland university to open the UTC. It will create a plethora of people who are interested in engineering, electronics and all the other kinds of apprenticeships that we require to continue the work and the factory going forward. In addition, the research and development facility for trains for Hitachi will be based in Newton Aycliffe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183.0/3">We should not forget that Hitachi built the bullet train in Japan, so if Hitachi is lucky enough to win the contract, it will have the technology to build the trains in this country. These trains would not be imported; they could be built in this country. That would mean 3,200 permanent jobs, not necessarily at Newton Aycliffe, but around the country, and jobs to maintain the trains as well. The capacity for the supply chain is fantastic.</p>
	<p pid="a.1183.0/4">The system of high-speed rail in Japan&#8212;the Shinkansen &#8212;covers 1,500 miles. The first high-speed rail started there in 1964, and Japan is on its eighth generation of high-speed train. The average delay on these trains is 36 seconds. I want a bit of that for the UK.</p>

	<p pid="a.1184.0/1">May I, too, welcome you to the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, as this is the first time I have spoken with you in that position, and offer many congratulations? I will be brief, because I have spoken at length before. I still think that HS2 is an expensive toy. I remember that we once had something else that went fast&#8212;it was called Concorde, and we know what happened to that. <i>[Interruption.]</i> It is still not flying these days, and it lost out to the jumbo jet.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.0/2">The Government have introduced this Bill, but it has not really moved this House or our knowledge of HS2 much further on. The Bill writes a blank cheque for the Government to spend as much as they want on the preparation of any of our railway works throughout the country, in perpetuity. The Government really introduced the Bill because they have lost control of the public relations on this project and they have lost control of the costs. I cannot even remember how many times we have read about the Department for Transport carrying out a &#8220;fightback&#8221; on this project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.0/3">No one is very impressed that four and a half years down the line a project that is supposed to be so worthy is still in the position it is in: the business case has worsened; the capacity claims have not been backed up in this Chamber today by any facts; the speed has now dropped away and is no longer the prime reason; and the connectivity is poor, as we have seen. Of course, all of us would agree with some of the aims and objectives, including mending the north-south divide, as has been discussed. We would all like those aims to be achieved, but I do not think that HS2 will do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.0/4">I am sorry that we did not have more time to discuss compensation, but compensation consultation is still going on and I hope that the Government will have a property bond.</p>

	<p pid="a.1184.1/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way on the point about compensation. Although it is important that the Bill be given a Third Reading tonight, because many of my constituents would otherwise be left in limbo, it must be placed on the record that the project cannot go ahead if a property bond is not put in place to defend people not just now, but in future. Even if the project is dropped, they still need that property bond.</p>

	<p pid="a.1184.2/1">I hear that, and many people would agree with my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.2/2">I am sad that the Bill is coming up for Third Reading without our having had longer to debate it. I, sadly, will be going through the Lobby to vote against it. I do not think any help or support should be given to the project. Many people around the country share my view. Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said recently:</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.2/3">&#8220;We agree with the need for key infrastructure spending, but . . . It is time for the Government to look at a thousand smaller projects instead of . . . one grand folly.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.2/4">Richard Wellings of the Institute of Economic Affairs said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.2/5">&#8220;This lossmaking project fails the commercial test, while standard cost-benefit analysis shows it to be extremely poor value for money.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1184.2/6">I could go on. Even the Adam Smith Institute says that HS2 is a disaster.</p>

	<p pid="a.1185.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that if there were a genuine business case for HS2 the Government would not have to put &#163;50 billion-plus of taxpayers&#8217; money into it, and the chief executive of Legal and General, which has announced a &#163;15 billion fund for UK infrastructure, would not say that he does not want one penny of that money spent on HS2?</p>

	<p pid="a.1185.1/1">I am grateful for the support for the quotes that I cited.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.1/2">As the Secretary of State well knows, we have an outstanding meeting on compensation. I know he has tried to fulfil that and I hope we can get together on compensation, because my constituents are so badly affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.1/3">I hope HS2 does not go ahead. The new love-in between those on the two Front Benches does not fool me much. I am pretty sure Labour will play politics with the project right up to the wire, but if it does go ahead, we must make sure that we have the best protection for our environment and our countryside, and the best compensation for people whose lives, businesses and communities will be rent asunder by the project. Nothing less will do.</p>

	<p pid="a.1185.2/1">I spoke and voted against the Bill on Second Reading, and I regret to say that nothing I have heard subsequently has convinced me that I should not vote against it again today. After Second Reading, the argument put forward by the Government began to unravel and people came out stating different positions from those that they had taken before.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.2/2">First, the Department for Transport upped the figures to &#163;42 billion. Then a previous Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the cost could go to &#163;80 billion and he was withdrawing his support. Then Lord Mandelson said that he attended the Cabinet meeting&#8212;presumably the same one as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40090" name="Jack Straw">the Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)</phrase> attended&#8212;where the project was dreamed up as a big idea on the back of an envelope without proper analysis or costings. You pays your money and you takes your choice as to what you want to believe, but I do not think that is the way we should undertake such a project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.2/3">There are two points that I wish to make. First, the Government say, not unreasonably, that to go ahead with such a big infrastructure project, they need the support of the main Opposition party. That is perfectly reasonable, but I have been there before, as have many Members in the House. I remember when Michael Heseltine was making preparations for the millennium. He went to the Labour party and said, &#8220;Look, I can&#8217;t build a millennium dome unless you commit yourselves to it.&#8221; We committed ourselves to it, and what happened? Well, there was a good party for the great and the good on new year&#8217;s eve, then attendances at the dome dwindled, we could not give it away, and eventually we ended up with &#163;600 million of taxpayers&#8217; money being totally</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.2/4">wasted because it had to be given away to AEG for nothing. That is what happens when we go in for a vanity project without proper costings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.2/5">Secondly, if this is a such a great bargain for the taxpayer and for this country, why is it not being financed by private capital or foreign sovereign wealth funds? The Government are no great lover of public enterprise. Indeed, they are doing their best to pass the very successful franchise on the east coast line back into private ownership. That is their position, fine, but why is private capital not coming into this project? Why are foreign sovereign wealth funds not coming in? The Government are quite happy to have a new generation of nuclear reactors built by a state-owned Chinese company that is answerable to the Chinese politburo, yet this project needs to be paid for with public money. I suspect the reason is quite simple: private capital will not touch it with a bargepole, because those involved know that it cannot be done within the figures that have been talked about. It will go massively over budget and they are not going to pick up the bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.2/6">I asked my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40462" name="Lilian Greenwood">the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood)</phrase> whether there was a pull-out figure for this project. She declined to give me a figure, and I understand that, but if there is no figure to all intents and purposes we are signing a blank cheque. If we go along with the Government and costs escalate&#8212;she made a very good point about degrees of incompetence&#8212;what will the pull-out figure be? What will happen if we get half the line built and all of a sudden the figure shoots up to nearly &#163;100 billion? What will we do then? Just continue?</p>
	<p pid="a.1185.2/7">I have a great deal of time for the Secretary of State and in many ways he is in a hole. As an ex-miner, however, he ought to know perfectly well that when someone is in a hole, they should stop digging. My strong advice to him is that he should stop digging. He does not want to end up with a white elephant.</p>

	<p pid="a.1186.0/1">HS2 is a very important project for the city of Leeds. The benefits it will bring to the north of England are immense, but they cannot be built on the back of hard-working people who have invested their livelihoods in their houses and so on. It is therefore vital that, before we sign the Bill off next spring, proper compensation is in place in the form of property bonds, and that the suggestions on rerouting, which are not about &#8220;not in my back yard&#8221; but propose sensible alternatives to ensure that the route follows existing transport corridors or goes through open countryside, are dealt with. With the best will in the world, we cannot mitigate the effects of such a development just 30 metres from the back of someone&#8217;s house.</p>
	<p pid="a.1186.0/2">I was a supporter of this project before I came to this House, but I cannot support it if the compensation package is not right. I urge the Secretary of State to ensure that it is right before the subject returns to the House in the spring.</p>

	<p pid="a.1186.1/1">High Speed 2 is essential national infrastructure, and we are at a critical part of the process. The concerns raised in today&#8217;s debate are very important, and many of them were raised by the Transport Committee two years ago. Some of them have been</p>
	<p pid="a.1186.1/2">addressed, but some need to be looked at further. It is now the responsibility of the Secretary of State, working with High Speed 2, to ensure that they are dealt with. The concerns relate to the environment, value for money and ensuring maximum economic benefit, including giving opportunities during construction for employment and apprenticeships across the country. The project is essential, but it must benefit the maximum number of people, and that is the Secretary of State&#8217;s responsibility as we reach this very important juncture.</p>

	<p pid="a.1187.0/2">I will make one quick point on the impact on my constituents in Rugby. We currently benefit from a fast and frequent service on the west coast main line, so with Virgin Trains we can be in London in 50 minutes and with London Midland we can be there in just under an hour. That is attractive to businesses coming to Rugby, which we can present as a great location. My fear is that, if the Bill goes ahead and the money is given to build High Speed 2, the legacy line will become a stopping line, with trains stopping at every station as the operator seeks to maximise revenues, because the city-to-city business will have been lost&#8212;</p>

Skerton community high school has fantastic pastoral care and all the students are immensely happy there. I therefore urge the House to support the community of Skerton and the children and parents of Skerton community high school in their fight to keep the school open.</p>

	<p pid="a.1191.1/1">I am proud, pleased and humbled to present a petition on behalf of more than 1,000 constituents in St Ives, in particular Peter Greenough of Bluebell cottage in Godolphin Cross. Some 200 people signed the petition in manuscript form and more than 850 did so through an online petition.</p>

	<p pid="a.1192.2/1">I applied for an Adjournment debate on academy schools because Snaresbrook primary school in my constituency was told some time ago that it was likely to become an academy. It is clear that the parents, governors, teachers, staff and surrounding community are opposed to that. The ward councillors, all three of whom are Conservatives, are also against it. The campaign is supported, impressively, by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40328" name="Lee Scott">the hon. Member for Ilford North (Mr Scott)</phrase> and by Redbridge council, which again is a Conservative local authority. By the way, Redbridge has invested a considerable amount in the school and has improved its fabric under very difficult circumstances over the past few months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192.2/2">Snaresbrook has a very good history by any objective judgment and was always well regarded. Suddenly, in June, it received a bad Ofsted report and was put into special measures. That took everybody by surprise. Under a new head, Carel Buxton, the school has shown clear signs of improvement and it is clear to everybody in the community that, in the long term, it will re-establish its reputation as a good primary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192.2/3">I was therefore surprised to receive a letter a couple of weeks ago from Lord Nash, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education, saying that, regardless of anything else, the school was to become an academy. Only this week, the hon. Member for Ilford North received an e-mail from the Department for Education saying that the school would not become an academy, but would remain as a maintained school. That was extremely welcome news.</p>

	<p pid="a.1192.3/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we must congratulate the parents and, as he rightly said, London borough of Redbridge council? We must also congratulate the hon. Gentleman himself, and everyone else involved&#8212;that probably includes me. We should thank the Department for Education, the Minister of State, and the Secretary of State for ensuring that Snaresbrook primary school is given the opportunity to continue the good work it has done in recent months.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-31a.1192.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40366" speakername="John Cryer" colnum="1192"  time="017:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#131031-0004.htm_spnew57">
	<p pid="a.1192.4/1">I have no hesitation in agreeing with the hon. Gentleman about that, and I was about to praise him for his work in supporting the campaign for the school to remain a maintained school. A number of children from his constituency are at the school and we have worked together successfully on a number of issues in our area, of which this is the latest. I have no hesitation in praising Redbridge council for doing an excellent job. As I said, it has managed to invest &#163;110,000 in the fabric of the school. That is pretty unusual given the scarcity of resources at the moment, yet the council managed it, and the local councillors deserve praise as well. I also thank the Department for Education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192.4/2">There are, however, issues relating to the processes that lead to academisation&#8212;to use a fairly modern sort of phrase. Before I raise those with the Minister, let me make it clear that I am not making a party political argument. I was not a fan of academies when the</p>
	<p pid="a.1192.4/3">Labour Government were in power&#8212;in fact, I was not a fan of quite a few things they did. I have not checked this, but a while ago I was reliably informed that I voted against my own side 84 times when we were in government. That must be some sort of record and it goes to show that I am not above having a crack at my own side if I think it necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192.4/4">It is widely agreed that two things contribute to improvements in schools&#8212;good leadership and good teaching&#8212;but neither necessarily arises out of academy status. I am sure there are academies with good leadership and good teaching, but there are also state maintained schools that have both those things. Serious concerns have been highlighted in various media reports about the governance and accountability in academy schools and free schools, although we are focusing on academies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192.4/5">We have seen stories in the press about chains of academies that are starting to form and which have been accused of moving investment from the schools to other things. Their chief executives are earning very high, perhaps inflated salaries, and large sums are spent on hospitality and junkets. The Select Committee on Education is yet to look at the record of academies. I am sure it will find that there are good ones, but also that there are question marks over accountability and democratic processes, which are not in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192.4/6">The process by which schools become academies raises questions for the Department for Education. There are, for instance, conflicts of interest. On <phrase class="date" code="2013-12-20">20 December</phrase> last year, the BBC revealed that at least four advisers contracted to work on the sponsored academies programme by the Department for Education are also Ofsted inspectors, which I would say was a conflict of interest. There are also a number who, according to the same report, have financial interests with academies and free schools but also work for the Department&#8212;again, there are questions to be answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1192.4/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-13">13 February</phrase> <i>The Independent </i>reported that the Department was busy offering money&#8212;in other words, inducements&#8212;to schools, which seems to have happened mainly in the north-west. It was reported that 32 schools in Lancashire were offered sums of &#163;40,000, or slightly less, for that purpose. They were told, &#8220;If you become an academy, you will receive a cash injection of &#163;40,000.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.1193.0/1">I am glad my hon. Friend has mentioned what is going on in the north-west, because there has been a lot of concern in schools in Lancashire, Merseyside and elsewhere about the approaches made by brokers&#8212;not just financial inducements, but a lot of pressure put on to a school to convert to academy status. Does my hon. Friend agree that one reason there is so much opposition to these conversions is the concern among parents, and others, about the use of unqualified teachers? That has been allowed in academies since July last year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-31a.1193.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40366" speakername="John Cryer" colnum="1193"  time="017:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#131031-0004.htm_spnew59">
	<p pid="a.1193.1/1">We had a debate earlier this week about the use of unqualified teachers. My view is that teachers should be appropriately qualified, and there is a question about that. Parents also have serious concerns about admissions. Once the local education authority is taken out of admissions, who co-ordinates that? Will there be an element of anarchy because no central body is controlling admissions? In other words, will it be a free-for-all?</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-11">11 February</phrase>, <i>The Guardian</i> reported a claim by the National Association of Head Teachers that academy brokers&#8212;that phrase is new to me&#8212;are given targets by the Department for Education on the number of the schools they must convert. One question I wanted to ask the Minister is whether those targets exists. Are academy brokers told, &#8220;You have to convert so many schools by such a point in future&#8221;? The same story recorded one head who claimed she had gone to a meeting and been told she was not allowed to leave until she had made a decision on the future of her school. Clearly, that is an unacceptable way to treat anybody, including a head teacher.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/3">There are also examples of head teachers and governors having to concentrate on demands placed on them by the Department rather than concentrating on improving the school. I am thinking of schools that have problems&#8212;failing schools in special measures or schools that are given an Ofsted verdict of requiring improvement. They might find that their time is taken up engaging with the Department in discussions on the future status of the school rather than engaging in improving the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/4">I have seen a number of Ofsted reports that make it clear that that is happening. For example, one report&#8212;I cannot mention the local authority or the school because it is in another constituency, and mentioning it would be a contravention of parliamentary convention&#8212;states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/5">&#8220;Another significant barrier to improvement has been the amount of time the headteacher has been involved in the discussions about transferring to an academy&#8230;Lengthy and time-consuming meetings with parents, unions, staff and external agencies have taken leaders&#8217; and governors&#8217; focus away from school improvement&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/6">I have a feeling that, over the next few years, we will see in the media stories of financial mismanagement arising from a lack of accountability, checks and balances, and democracy in the governance of academies and free schools. A parallel can be drawn with the situation when the Government introduced co-operation for further education colleges in 1992. Some of the colleges were fine and worked perfectly well but, because of the lack of accountability, a series of scandals followed&#8212;they were documented pretty closely by a number of publications&#8212;in which some principals, because they were given a free hand, abused their position. They got up to all sorts of things, financial and otherwise, that were deeply questionable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/7">To conclude, I have a number of questions for the Minister. I should like him to answer them, but if he does not have answers to hand, I should like him to write to me with the information. Are any contractors who are paid by the Department also Ofsted inspectors? Is anybody working in any way for the Department who has a financial interest in academies and/or free schools? Are academy brokers required by law to abide by the civil service code of conduct? The answer to that last question was given some time ago in another Adjournment debate, and it seemed to be that they are required to abide by the code of conduct. However, in a later Question Time, the Secretary of State equivocated and did not say whether they must abide by the code of conduct or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/8">I asked whether brokers are given targets for converting schools to academy status. Is it legitimate for schools to ask academy brokers to declare any conflicts of interest at the outset of their engagement? In other words, would it be legitimate, at the first meeting, for the</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/9">schools to say, &#8220;Is there any conflict of interest you would like to bring to our attention or of which we should be aware?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/10">As I understand it, when the Academies Commission reported in January 2013, it found that there was no evidence that academies performed significantly better than maintained schools. Is that so? Will the Minister confirm that TUPE rights apply to all staff who are transferred from maintained schools to academies?</p>
	<p pid="a.1193.1/11">I thank the Minister for replying to the debate. He has drawn a bit of a short straw by getting the Adjournment debate on a Thursday afternoon. By the way, it appears that the massed ranks of Parliament have turned out for it, compared with previous Adjournment debates I have introduced. That shows what an important issue this is. I have been to Adjournment debates on Thursdays with the Minister and one Whip, and no one else. Today, there is a magnificent turnout on both sides of the House. I pay tribute to the hon. Members who are here and the Minister.</p>

	<p pid="a.1195.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40366" name="John Cryer">the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead (John Cryer)</phrase> on securing this important debate and raising these issues in which he takes a close personal interest. I assure him that I have no problem being here this evening, and I am actually the duty Minister for tomorrow as well so I would be here anyway. I do not know why I am getting all these short straws.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/2">I also pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40328" name="Lee Scott">the Member for Ilford North (Mr Scott)</phrase>, who intervened. Although he is not the constituency MP for the school, I know that he has taken an interest on behalf of concerned parents and others in the area, and we have listened closely to both hon. Members on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/3">The hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead asked several questions, including about the circumstances of the individual school, which I shall go into in detail; about general policy on academies, which I wish to cover; and some specific questions about the performance management of academy brokers and potential conflicts of interest between Ofsted inspectors and others. On those latter points, I shall write to him&#8212;as he anticipated &#8212;to ensure that I can supply detailed answers, because I do not have the answers to some of those specific questions to hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/4">It is now three years since we expanded the academies programme to enable all schools to become academies, including the ability for primary schools to become academies in their own right for the first time. We did this because we believe that teachers and heads should have more freedom to run schools and more power to innovate in the best interests of their students. More than half of secondary schools and a significant proportion of primary schools are now academies, with more converting every month.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/5">Schools across the country are taking advantage of the freedom that academy status gives them, including having more control over their funding. The decision whether a school should become an academy is, rightly, entirely voluntary for the overwhelming majority of schools, and will remain so. More than 2,500 schools have decided to convert and have become academies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/6">These range from small rural primaries to large secondary schools. We expect these academies to work in partnership with other schools to share their knowledge, experience and expertise, with the highest performing institutions helping the weaker institutions to improve.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/7">In addition to the converter academies, there are now almost 900 sponsored academies. We have made it clear that we want to turn around underperforming schools by finding new academy sponsors for them. As the hon. Gentleman said, this is about raising standards and getting better leadership and governance in weak schools. It is not good enough that some children are left to struggle in schools where a large proportion of the pupils are unable to achieve minimum standards year after year. We want to find lasting solutions to underperformance so that all children have the opportunities that they deserve. This is crucial because each child has only one real chance in life to secure a good education. That is why improving schools rapidly is really important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/8">Our priority now is to continue tackling poorly performing primary schools so that all pupils have the skills they need to succeed in secondary education. There are schools whose history of underperformance and inability to sustain improvements are causing us real concern. That is why we are working with local authorities across the country to secure better outcomes for their pupils, sometimes by transforming under- performing schools into sponsored academies. In several areas we can point to dramatic improvements in schools that have been failing for some years, but with a new sponsor they have seen significant improvements in performance over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/9">In the case of Snaresbrook primary school in the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s constituency, the school was judged by Ofsted in June to require special measures. It is worth saying that Ofsted found that the achievement of pupils, quality of teaching, behaviour and safety of pupils and leadership and management at the school were inadequate. As the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, that is a serious matter where prompt action is required. As a result of the inspection, we asked the governing body to consider the benefits of becoming an academy and we proposed an academy sponsor based on a nearby outstanding school. Our policy remains that becoming an academy with the support of a strong sponsor is often the best way to ensure rapid and sustained improvement. However, in this case we recognise that Snaresbrook primary school does not have a long history of underperformance and was previously judged good by Ofsted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/10">We also acknowledge that the school has made progress since being placed in special measures. The local authority acted swiftly in removing the head teacher and chair of governors, brokering a partnership arrangement with a nearby outstanding school, and providing specialist English and maths consultants, among other changes. We also recognise that in this year&#8217;s national tests&#8212;not all the data are checked and in the public domain yet&#8212;pupil performance appears to have improved significantly at key stage 2. We understand that the school&#8217;s results for reading, writing and maths are the best for five years, and among the highest in Redbridge. I understand that pupil progression has improved this year, and that the number of pupils making at least two levels of progress at the end of key stage 2 will be above the local authority and national average.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/11">Those changes, complemented by representations from the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Ilford North, led us to conclude, after Ofsted had looked at the situation, that we needed to review the decision we were making. The changes led Ofsted to conclude at a monitoring inspection earlier this month that the school&#8217;s improvement plan is fit for purpose. Inspectors also commented on how leaders have made clear their expectations and ambitions for the school regaining and sustaining its former reputation as a high-achieving school. We will therefore continue to monitor the school&#8217;s progress in coming out of special measures, but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, we do not currently plan to intervene in Snaresbrook primary school to force academisation on the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1195.0/12">However, we are not treating Snaresbrook differently from any other school judged inadequate by Ofsted. At all stages, we have been clear that our goal is school improvement. We will always seek to work with local authorities and schools to find solutions on which everyone can agree, as we have done successfully in many parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.1197.0/1">I will not ask the Minister about qualified teachers today&#8212;we have done that a lot recently. On school improvement and whether academies do better than the state-maintained sector, does he accept that all the evidence&#8212;not just that from the Academies Commission &#8212;is inconclusive when comparing improvement in like-for-like schools?</p>

	<p pid="a.1197.2/1">I shall indeed, Madam Deputy Speaker, although I will say a word about some of the wider issues in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197.2/2">In all cases, a school can become an academy only after statutory consultation has taken place. That gives parents, governors and the local community the opportunity to put forward their views. These representations are always considered as part of the decision-making process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197.2/3">On the point raised by the hon. Gentleman, academy status has made a big improvement in transforming underperforming schools, giving them the freedom to innovate by creating the right conditions for success. In recent years, the results of sponsored academies have gone up faster than those of other state-funded schools, and have turned around some of our worst schools. Their performance has continued to improve this year; in fact, the longer they are open, the better on average they do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197.2/4">I make it clear that sponsored academies remain state schools funded by the state. All academies are run by non-profit-making charitable trusts, which sign funding agreements with the Secretary of State. They are also required by their funding agreements to follow the law and guidance on admissions, special educational needs and exclusions, as though they were maintained schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197.2/5">I hope I have made it clear today that our absolute priority is to see sustainable improvement in schools that have been underperforming for many years. Where underperformance is not being tackled effectively, the Secretary of State has the power to intervene to help ensure that standards are raised quickly, and these powers include replacing current governors with interim executive members, although this power has been used only sparingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197.2/6">I would like to reiterate my thanks to the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead for securing this debate, and I thank him and the hon. Member for Ilford North for their role in raising this issue. Many schools across the country are choosing to become academies, and we will continue to work with underperforming schools and their local authorities to transform the life chances of some of the most disadvantaged children in the country. I will write to the hon. Member for Leyton and Wanstead to address his detailed points.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197.2/7">Finally, along with all hon. Members I would like to wish Snaresbrook primary school, its leadership, teachers and pupils the very best for the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197.2/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1197.2/9" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
