I hope that, in the interests of Britain&#8217;s armed forces, we will be able to have a constructive relationship, as he quite properly holds me to account for the decisions of this Government, and I hold him to account for the decisions of the last one.</p>
	<p pid="b.1.6/2">When the previous Administration took office in 1997, the Territorial Army was more than 50,000 strong. By the time they left office in 2010, that figure had halved. That pattern of decline has been arrested, and the strength has now been stabilised. Recruitment figures for the first three quarters of 2013 are due to be published by Defence Analytical Services and Advice on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-14">14 November</phrase>. This is a new data series, and quarterly figures will be published thereafter.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.7/2">Most people would describe the current recruitment target as challenging and difficult to meet.

Will the Secretary of State explain how he intends to disseminate best practice in those areas?</p>

	<p pid="b.1.8/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that important point. At the moment, the armed forces recruit about 8% of their strength from women, who make up about 50% of the target age group population, and just 3% of their strength from black and ethnic minority communities, which will make up about 24% of the target age group population by 2020. We have to do better in those areas, and one of the challenges that we have set for the armed forces, and for the Army in particular, is for them to work out how they can pitch an offer that is more attractive to female and black and ethnic minority recruits, and specifically how they can use female recruits more effectively within Future Force 2020.</p>

	<p pid="b.1.10/1">I recently joined more than 100 supporters of 2nd<sup>( )</sup>Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers as they marched on Parliament protesting against the Government&#8217;s decision to scrap it. Ministers believe that the battalion can be replaced by reservists, but the chairman of the Northumberland and North East Fusilier Association is concerned that it will be impossible to recruit the necessary numbers. Will the Secretary of State tell us to what extent the targets are being met?</p>

	<p pid="b.3.0/1">The reconfiguration of the Army, including the changing role of reservists and the changing structure of the Army, are not simply about trying to recruit reservists to replace disbanded infantry battalions. Most of the reservists we recruit will be specialists, rather than having a light infantry role. The White Paper that I published earlier this year set out a plan to reverse the long-term decline of the Army Reserve, redefining its role and setting out details of improved equipment, training, terms and conditions. Under the plan, we will grow the Army Reserve to a trained strength of 30,000 by 2018. I can also tell the House that, although it is still early days, a snapshot of data for the recruiting campaign that started on <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-16">16 September</phrase> is quite positive. We received 1,576 applications to join the Army Reserve during the first four weeks of the campaign, and 380 were received last week. It is very early days, but those early signs are quite promising.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.1/1">I congratulate the Secretary of State on the encouraging early signs in the recruiting campaign. There will come a time when it will become plain either that he will have achieved the Future Force 2020 ambition of replacing regular soldiers with reservists or that he has not done so and will have to change his plan. When will that date be?</p>

	<p pid="b.3.2/1">The Army is in the final stages of setting out a properly thought-through recruiting target set, defining the number of recruits needed during each period of time in order to deliver the trained output required if we are to achieve our 2018 target. As soon as I have those data from the Army in final form, I will publish them. They will set our target curve, and I expect to be held to account if we go significantly off it.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.3/1">I hope that my right hon. and learned Friend will forgive me if I press him a little further on this topic. There is a lot of anecdotal evidence that the targets are proving difficult to achieve. Given that the target of 30,000 is fundamental to the success of the restructuring of the Army, what contingency plans are now in place, and what incentives are being offered to individuals&#8212;and their employers&#8212;to become part of the Army Reserve?</p>

	<p pid="b.3.4/1">I am grateful to my right hon. and learned Friend. Unfortunately, I am not his &#8220;learned Friend&#8221;: I am used to being called an accountant, but not a lawyer. I can reassure him that a variety of measures are in place to incentivise recruitment to the reserves; in particular, a bonus to attract those leaving the regular Army into volunteer reserve service has proved very successful, with significant upturn in the translation rate over the past few months. There will be a range of further incentive measures that we can introduce as and when it is necessary in order to deliver the targets which I shall publish shortly.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.5/1">I thank the Secretary of State for his kind remarks, which I greatly appreciate. We will, of course, work with him where appropriate. I welcome to her post my Nottinghamshire colleague, the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase>, who I understand is the first woman Defence Minister in the House of Commons, which is a great credit to her.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.5/2">The Government need to explain to the House and the country today what is happening with their programme of reform to the armed forces. I declare an interest, as my soon to be son-in-law serves in the Territorial Army. A recent high-level memo from the Ministry of Defence states clearly that there are clear problems and worries over Army reform and that recruitment targets are likely to be missed. That has caused senior military figures, Members of the House and the armed forces community to raise serious concerns. Can the Secretary of State assure us that the nation&#8217;s security will not be compromised and that a reduction in the regular Army will take place only if adequate uplift in the reserves is achieved?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.4.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40512" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="4"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0001.htm#131104-0001.htm_spnew10">
	<p pid="b.4.0/1">I am grateful for the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s question. The memo from which he quoted did not say what he claimed it said. It said that in the absence of any action to stimulate recruitment we would face a very difficult challenge. We are now taking precisely that action. The hon. Gentleman may have seen an article that came from an interview with the Chief of the Defence Staff, in which he made it clear that he was very confident that we will deliver these numbers. I share that confidence.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.4.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40269" speakername="Vernon Coaker" colnum="4"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0001.htm#131104-0001.htm_spnew11">
	<p pid="b.4.1/1">We look forward to the Defence Secretary publishing that memo so that we can all see what it actually said. Is not the problem one of credibility? The Government cannot get their figures right. Just today, we learned that the cost of new aircraft carriers has increased by &#163;800 million to &#163;6.2 billion. That is after the &#163;100 million wasted last year on reversing the decision on fighter jets. A few months ago, the Defence Secretary told us he had balanced the books at the MOD, and then just a few weeks ago we were told that there was an &#163;1.8 billion underspend. How can the British public have confidence that the Government will meet their target for recruitment to the reserves when they have got so much else wrong? When will the Defence Secretary take some responsibility and stop blaming everyone else but himself?</p>

	<p pid="b.4.2/1">With that last remark, the hon. Gentleman has probably pre-empted my response. If I were him, I would tread a little more carefully around the issue of the cost of the aircraft carriers&#8212;until he hears, in due course, what precisely we have done. A huge amount of work is going on across the Army around the reserves recruitment initiative. There are many different strands to this work. I have made a commitment in the past, which I will repeat today, to be as transparent as possible with Parliament as this campaign gets under way. I remind the hon. Gentleman, however, that we are just five weeks into a five-year campaign to halt and reverse the attrition in our reserves that the previous Government oversaw.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.4.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40417" speakername="Patrick Mercer" colnum="4"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0001.htm#131104-0001.htm_spnew13">
	<p pid="b.4.3/1">In my experience, inquiries about recruiting by no means turn into enlistments. Everything we have heard suggests that the recruiting for the reserves will be difficult. Was it therefore correct for our regular forces redundancy programme to have gone ahead with the urgency that it did?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.4.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40512" speakername="Philip Hammond" colnum="4"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0001.htm#131104-0001.htm_spnew14">
	<p pid="b.4.4/1">Perhaps my hon. Friend did not hear me earlier. I was not talking about inquiries; I was talking about 1,576 applications to join the Army Reserve</p>
	<p pid="b.4.4/2">in the first four weeks of the campaign. The simple fact is that if we are to live within our budgets and restructure the Army for its tasks in the future, the decisions we made about the size and shape of the regular Army must go forward, and the recruitment and training of 30,000 Army reserves must happen. We will make sure that they do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.3/1">As I have said in the House before, the Government understand the significance of SMEs to the United Kingdom&#8217;s economy. The Ministry of Defence is playing its part in increasing the number of opportunities for SMEs to contribute to defence, both as direct suppliers and as subcontractors on major programmes. We recently published details of the MOD spend for 2012-13. Some &#163;1.1 billion was spent directly with 12,000 SMEs. During that year, 10% of all new contracts by value and 36% by number were placed with more than 1,000 SMEs.</p>

	<p pid="b.5.4/1">Jobs in the supply chain are vital to constituencies such as Ogmore, but I understand that last year the MOD was fined &#163;21,000 for making late payments to suppliers. The new contracts and direct payments that were promised by Ministers have not materialised. Can the Minister explain to SMEs in the supply chain in Ogmore and throughout the United Kingdom why the Government&#8217;s actions do not match their rhetoric?</p>

	<p pid="b.5.5/1">I am very glad that the hon. Gentleman has chosen to light on the single late payment penalty that the MOD suffered in just one of the 4 million transactions that took place in 2012-13. It involved a company that was not based in Ogmore, not based in Wales, and not based anywhere else in the United Kingdom. It was for late payment for aviation fuel sent by a supplier to our base in Akrotiri in Cyprus, with an invoice from a Greek company in Corinth, over the Christmas holidays.

Indeed, the Ministry of Defence is investing heavily in Yeovilton in order for it to be the main operating base for all Wildcat helicopters flown by the Royal Navy and the Army.

The announcement that has been made relates to the removal from Ripon of 21 Engineer Regiment, Royal Engineers, as we consolidate around Catterick. The separate but adjacent site, Deverell barracks, and the associated training area have not been subject to that announcement. A decision on them will be made separately, but I understand that the two sites are very much linked.</p>

Many major private companies have already signed up to the corporate covenant, and more are considering doing so. There are excellent examples of companies working with us to reach out to their employees, and to make a joint proposition to them, so that employees join the reserves in a way that is supported by their employer, not done behind the employer&#8217;s back.</p>

	<p pid="b.23.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the abscond of an individual subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measure, or TPIM. The Metropolitan police believe that on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-01">Friday 1 November</phrase>, TPIM subject Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed absconded from his controls. He was last seen at 3.15 pm inside a mosque in Acton. The police counter-terrorism command immediately launched an intensive covert operation to trace Mohamed, and inquiries continue. Ports and borders were notified with his photograph, and details were circulated nationally and internationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/2">Acting on police advice, on Saturday I applied to the High Court for an order protecting Mohamed&#8217;s anonymity to be lifted, in order to assist the police with their investigation. Last night, the police appealed for the public&#8217;s help in tracing him. The police have urged anyone who sees Mohamed or knows of his whereabouts not to approach him but to call 999 or contact the anti-terrorist hotline.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/3">The police and Security Service have confirmed that they do not believe Mohamed poses a direct threat to the public in the UK. The reason he was put on a TPIM in the first place was to prevent his travelling to support terrorism overseas.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/4">I have spoken several times over the weekend to the director general of the Security Service, Andrew Parker, and to the Metropolitan police assistant commissioner for specialist operations, Cressida Dick. I received another briefing earlier today. They have told me that they believe they have all the resources and support they need to carry out the manhunt. However, I will not hesitate to provide them with any additional assistance they require.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.1/5">The whole House will join me in thanking the police and the Security Service for their continued efforts to keep our country safe. Their focus is to locate and arrest Mr Mohamed. They are doing everything in their power to apprehend him as quickly as possible. The Government will provide them with all the support they need. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.23.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" speakername="Yvette Cooper" colnum="23"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0001.htm#131104-0001.htm_spnew114">
	<p pid="b.23.2/1">Parliament will be deeply concerned about the Home Secretary&#8217;s statement. Obviously, all hon. Members want the police and the Security Service to have all possible help to apprehend Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed as soon as possible. The Home Secretary says that Mr Mohamed poses no direct threat, even though he is widely reported in the media to have attended terror training camps, procured weapons and planned attacks. He has walked away from a terror suspect order in a very simple disguise, and the Home Secretary has no idea where he is. He is the second man in 10 months who has absconded while subject to a TPIM. There were only 10 such men to begin with, and two have now gone: one in a black cab and one in a disguise. The Opposition called for controls to be tightened, for the legislation to be revisited and for lessons to be learned. None of that has happened. The Home Secretary has done nothing.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.2/2">Since control orders were strengthened some years ago, no one absconded&#8212;since 2007. Lord Carlile, the former counter-terror reviewer, has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.23.2/3">&#8220;nobody absconded while subject to a relocation order&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2013-01-08.20"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 8 January 2013; Vol. 742, c. 20</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.23.2/4">However, since the Home Secretary got rid of relocation orders and control orders and introduced the weaker TPIMs, two terror suspects have vanished. Ibrahim Magag was previously relocated to the west country. The Home Secretary&#8217;s decision brought him back, and he disappeared. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed was previously relocated outside London. The Home Secretary&#8217;s decision brought him back and he, too, has disappeared. Her policies brought those two terror suspects back into contact with their old networks and with people who could help them to disappear, and made it easier for them to run off.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.2/5">Last time the Home Secretary said there was plenty of money for the added surveillance needed, so was Mr Mohamed under active surveillance when he entered the mosque, or was it just ordinary CCTV? His case was in court on Friday&#8212;he was accused of tampering with his tag&#8212;but why did the Government drop the case? Were the tags faulty? Were there other charges?</p>
	<p pid="b.23.2/6">The Home Secretary said that Mr Mohamed was under a TPIM to stop him travelling overseas. What did she plan to do next year when his and all the other TPIMs ran out?</p>
	<p pid="b.23.2/7">TPIMs apply to a very small number of difficult cases. Everyone recognises that there is no perfect answer and that there will always be challenges, but this Home Secretary has made it easier for serious terror suspects to disappear. That is irresponsible. She was warned about changing the law and weakening controls. She was warned that more people would abscond and they have done so&#8212;twice&#8212;but still she will not act. The question on everyone&#8217;s lips is: how many more warnings does the Home Secretary need?</p>

	<p pid="b.24.0/1">This is a serious issue, but the right hon. Lady&#8217;s response was beneath somebody who is supposed to understand these matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/2">The right hon. Lady referred to the money available for surveillance. I understand that she briefed Sky News this morning that she would tell the House of Commons that there have been cuts to the funding for monitoring and surveillance. I notice that she has dropped that from her argument, because the truth, as she well knows, is that as part of the TPIM package the Government introduced in 2011 we did not cut the surveillance budget for the police and Security Service but increased it&#8212;by tens of millions of pounds per year. We did not cut the budgets for counter-terrorism, policing and the security service; we protected them.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/3">The right hon. Lady asked about the lessons learned from the Magag case. I can confirm that there was a review of that case, which was shared with David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, who mentioned it in his annual review. All the recommendations of that review have been acted on. I can also confirm that a similar review will be conducted of this case.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/4">The right hon. Lady referred to the changes in TPIMs. They are, of course, time-limited, but time limits have nothing to do with this case, as the subject was still bound by the terms of his TPIM. What she never tells</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/5">the House when she makes this point is that 43 people who were subject to control orders have now exited those control orders. The truth is that even before time-limited TPIMs were introduced, the courts would not allow people to be left permanently on control orders. When the Metropolitan Police Commissioner was asked whether he had concerns about time limits, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/6">&#8220;I do not think so.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.25.0/1">What about relocations?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.25.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40382" speakername="Theresa May" colnum="25"  time="015:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0001.htm#131104-0001.htm_spnew117">
	<p pid="b.25.1/1">I will come on to the relocations.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/2">The right hon. Lady talked about tagging. GPS tags are used to provide information on the location of TPIM subjects and the tags that are used for TPIMs are significantly better than the ones they replaced, which had no ability to track subjects outside their homes. In this case, the police believe that the tag functioned exactly as it should have done, but it will be one of the aspects considered as part of the review of the case, and I should tell the House that I have been advised that this abscond does not raise any new operational issues with the tags.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/3">The right hon. Lady also talked about relocation, but she knows that if someone is determined to break the terms of their TPIM or control order, there is little to stop them doing so in one place or another. David Anderson, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, says:</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/4">&#8220;The only sure way to prevent absconding is to lock people up in a high security prison.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/5">Unless the right hon. Lady is proposing the introduction of such draconian laws&#8212;and I thought she had conceded long ago that 90 days was too long&#8212;she should accept what David Anderson says. There will always be the risk of an abscond.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/6">The shadow Home Secretary talked about the control order regime as though it never allowed any absconding by its subjects, but during the six years that control orders existed, there were seven absconds and only one of those seven people was ever found again. The idea that somehow control orders prevented absconds is not true. Even if we wanted to go back to the days of control orders, we would not be able to do so. The powers available under control orders were being steadily eroded by the courts, and the system was becoming unviable. Unlike control orders, TPIMs have been upheld consistently by the courts, so we now have a strong and sustainable legal framework to handle terror suspects.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/7">The police and security service have always said that there has been no substantial increase in overall risk since the introduction of TPIMs, and despite the implication of what the right hon. Lady said, we have increased by tens of millions of pounds the annual budget for surveillance by the police and security service&#8212;and we have also given them new powers. In April this year, in a written statement, I explained how we would use the royal prerogative to remove passports from British nationals whom we want to prevent from travelling abroad to take part in extremist activity, terrorism training or other fighting. That power has already been used on several occasions since it was introduced. As for foreign nationals, the Immigration Bill will make it easier for us to get them out of the country, By the way, the Opposition failed to vote for that Bill on Second Reading.</p>
	<p pid="b.25.1/8">The idea that under this Government the police and Security Service have fewer powers to keep us safe is just wrong. The idea that they have less money to keep us safe is wrong. The right hon. Lady should take her responsibilities seriously and support the police and Security Service in the important work that they do.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.1/1">This is an issue to which my hon. Friend has paid much attention in her constituency. I understand that the mosque authorities have been co-operating with the police and we welcome that co-operation. She refers to radicalisation. Within our counter-terrorism strategy we have the Prevent strand, which is precisely to ensure that young people and others do not find themselves being radicalised, and that we can exercise interventions, particularly through the Channel programme, to help to stop that radicalisation taking place. As I said in relation to the mosque where this individual was last sighted, I am pleased that the mosque authorities have been co-operating with the police.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.2/1">In the light of no abscondings under control orders in the five years from 2007 after they were strengthened, but two abscondings in the past 10 months since TPIMs, which the Home Secretary introduced, greatly weakened the controls on these individuals, does she not think that a little contrition rather than bombast would be appropriate in these circumstances? Does she not recognise that the fundamental responsibility of any Home Secretary is to take proper measures to protect the safety and security of the British people? She has failed to do so by acting irresponsibly in weakening the powers available to control terrorists.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.3/1">May I first say to the right hon. Gentleman that this is my first opportunity in the Chamber to note that he has announced his retirement from politics? He has given many years of service to this House, to his constituents and to the Government in various roles. I am sure there are many people who will be sorry to see him go from this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.26.3/2">National security is always the Government&#8217;s first priority. The right hon. Gentleman quoted some figures. I have to say to him that, yes, there have been two absconds in the two years that TPIMs have been in place, but there were seven absconds in six years under control orders. As I made clear in my response to the shadow Home Secretary, the control order regime was gradually being eroded by the courts. What we now have under TPIMs is a legally supported regime that puts measures in place to control and provide for those individuals whom we cannot prosecute, but who present a risk. The best place for any individual who is a terrorist is behind bars.</p>

	<p pid="b.27.2/1">I welcome what the Home Secretary has said about the burqa. This is not a case where the burqa is responsible. I urge her to look at the role of G4S and the tags that have been provided. As she knows, last week a number of cases were dropped after the police found out that there was a suggestion that tags had been tampered with; in fact, it was a question of wear and tear. Will she please investigate this again, rather than just accept that assurance? Was Mr Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed a British citizen? If he was, when did he acquire citizenship, bearing in mind the fact that he was a support of al-Shabaab, and does she have his passport?</p>

Gentleman raised the same issue over the Magag case. On tags, as I said earlier, the police believe that, in this case, the tag functioned exactly as it should have done. He referred to the court case. The issue there was not about the effectiveness of the tags, but about reaching the evidence threshold for taking a criminal prosecution in relation to the operation of the tag.<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131106/corrtext/131106c0001.htm#column_1MC"><i>[Official Report, 6 November 2013, Vol. 570, c. 1MC.]</i></a></p>

Gentleman, furthermore, that the police and security services have to deal with a number of individuals, not simply those involved in TPIMs, and we saw some good prosecutions earlier this year of those who were involved in plots to cause significant harm to British citizens.</p>

There will be circumstances in which it is appropriate to require somebody to remove a face covering: that could be in court, as we have seen in a number of instances; it could be at the border, for security purposes; and individual institutions such as schools should make their own policy in relation to dress that they consider appropriate in their institution.

If memory serves me correctly, the fund is a follow-through from the recommendations of the Speaker&#8217;s Conference which concluded in February 2010. The matter is indeed of the utmost importance, so I am disappointed if she has received less than substantive responses. The general principle here, as the Deputy Leader of the House, who is on the Treasury Bench, will know, is that ministerial replies to questions should be both timely and substantive. If they are heavily delayed, that is a discourtesy. If they are &#8220;insubstantive&#8221; or insubstantial, whether delayed or not, that is not serving the House. Members look for a response that is as comprehensive as possible and informative. If the hon. Lady has not achieved that so far, I hope that the Deputy Leader of the House may be willing, in Parliament&#8217;s interest, to assist her in her endeavours. If she has to go through the Table Office again to probe further, I do not think she will require any additional encouragement from me.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">The Bill underlines this Government&#8217;s belief that pro-business policies help growth and job creation. For too long, our economy has been dependent on a booming financial services sector, on the one hand, and unsustainable levels of public spending, on the other. That made us particularly vulnerable to the crisis of 2007-08, the consequences of which continue to be felt today.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.2/3">The challenge the Government faced in 2010 was how to begin the process of getting our public finances in order and to put in place the conditions for growth. Some believed that it was not possible to do both and some argued that measures to reduce the deficit would result in higher levels of unemployment. It was the Leader of the Opposition, no less, who said that the Government clearly had</p>
	<p pid="b.37.2/4">&#8220;a programme that will lead to the disappearance of one million jobs&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.2/5">That was just over three years ago and there are now more people in work than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.2/6">Since the coalition came to power, employment has increased by more than 1 million and there are 1.4 million private sector jobs, more than there were at the time of the last election. Employment in the three months until August 2013 was at its highest ever level, at 29.87 million. Those predicting disaster massively underestimated the capability of businesses up and down the country to adapt, innovate and expand, but they also failed to appreciate that we now had in place a Government on the side of businesses who were willing to put in place the conditions that help them to invest and expand, whether by addressing burdensome regulations or reforming our tax system.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.2/7">In case we forget, such action included reversing the worst effects of the previous Government&#8217;s jobs tax. Yes, at a time when we needed businesses more than ever to take on more staff, Labour&#8217;s contribution to deficit reduction consisted of increasing the tax on jobs.</p>

	<p pid="b.37.3/1">Does my hon. Friend think that it is possibly because they are embarrassed by that record that there are only two Labour Back Benchers in the whole Chamber and nobody from the other Opposition parties? How many extra jobs does he think his excellent Bill might help to create?</p>

	<p pid="b.37.4/1">My right hon. Friend makes a very good observation. I can rarely remember so few Labour Members being present for the opening of a Second Reading debate. I was beginning to take it personally, but he has reassured me that this issue does not attract the interest of the Opposition. Labour is the party that intended to increase the jobs tax. Pretty much the only measure that they had for deficit reduction was to increase employers&#8217; national insurance contributions, which was not a sensible approach at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.37.4/2">We are not predicting how many jobs the Bill might create because a number of factors apply. It is interesting to note, however, that the Federation of Small Businesses believes that the measure is better than the one that it had advocated, which it anticipated would have created 45,000 new jobs. It has carried out a survey of its members and 28% of respondents believed that this measure would help them to increase the number of people they employ. That is a very encouraging step.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.0/1">I accept entirely that the Minister cannot give specifics on the number of jobs the Bill will create, although quite evidently it will create jobs. Can he estimate how many employers he expects it to assist, particularly in the north-east?</p>

	<p pid="b.38.1/1">That is a similar point, and, as I say, I am nervous about giving precise numbers. Of the FSB respondents, 28% believed that this would help them. We believe that we have to consider a range of measures, but clearly measures that reduce the cost of taking on staff must help in increasing employment. For example, the Bill would enable a business to take on four people on the national minimum wage and not pay any employers&#8217; national insurance contributions at all. That will clearly help.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.2/1">My hon. Friend mentions the welcome for this Bill from the FSB. Is he aware that charities and social enterprises will also benefit from it? Alex Swallow, chief executive of the Small Charities Coalition, said:</p>
	<p pid="b.38.2/2">&#8220;For a lot of the smallest charities, having one paid member of staff is a big step forward&#8230;having this allowance now helps them to do that, so it is a very positive thing.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.38.3/1">I am very grateful to my hon. Friend for that intervention. She makes an important point that applies to both businesses and charities. Taking on the first member of staff can be the most difficult step, as it is a big event for a business. If we are able to help and to reform our tax system to enable businesses or charities to take that member of staff on without paying the jobs tax&#8212;employer&#8217;s national insurance contributions&#8212;that will clearly encourage those businesses, which, I hope, will then take on further staff and expand.</p>

	<p pid="b.38.4/1">Will my hon. Friend confirm that the measure was the largest tax cut in the Budget? Does he therefore not think it is all the more surprising that there are no Labour Members here to scrutinise a major plank of that Budget?</p>

	<p pid="b.38.5/1">Another observation one could make is that there are no Labour Members of Parliament here because they are&#8212;<i>[Interruption.]</i> I apologise. That remark is unfair and I withdraw it. There are the Labour Front Benchers and now three Back Benchers. Who knows? We might reach five or six by the end of the debate. Perhaps Labour Members have confidence in, and enthusiasm for, the Bill and can find nothing to criticise. However, we look forward to the speeches to come later. On that note, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" name="Julie Hilling">the hon. Member for Bolton West (Julie Hilling)</phrase> has waited so patiently, and as it is about time that we heard from a Labour Member, I give way to her.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.0/1">I thank the Minister for giving way. Has he considered the fact that there are only a few Labour Members here because, to our relief, he has, in the end, listened to what we have been asking for and included a great deal of it in the Bill? I congratulate him on listening to us, and therefore on introducing the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.1/1">That, too, is a theory, but I am not sure that it is necessarily persuasive. When we fought the previous general election, the Labour Government&#8217;s big policy for deficit reduction, among a pretty thin set of policies, was a big increase in national insurance contributions. We have already reversed the worst effects of that, and the Bill is a further measure that will help businesses up and down the country to create jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.1/2">The hon. Member for Bolton West is referring to one element of Labour&#8217;s five-point plan, which we do not hear much about any more, but there were serious problems with Labour&#8217;s proposal; this one is very different from that. It was a much more targeted scheme aimed at smaller employers taking on new employees, which raised all sorts of practical questions about how to define a new employee and how to prevent there being perverse incentives. I put it to the House that that scheme was neither workable nor likely to achieve its objectives. I suspect that we shall return to that issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.4/1">No, I am definitely Bashful. Cheeky is probably on the other side of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.4/2">Does my hon. Friend the Minister agree that the key component&#8212;the most important innovation in the proposal&#8212;is the fact that it encourages confidence among businesses, particularly small businesses? I held a jobs fair a couple of weeks ago and 500 jobs, part-time and full-time, were available. Many small businesses at the fair thought that cutting their tax through this measure was the right thing to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.5/1">I am grateful to hear of the experience in Tamworth, and my hon. Friend is right to raise that point. Particularly for those small employers taking on their first person, the fact that they do not have to pay employer&#8217;s national insurance contributions at 13.8% will help them. In many cases, the Bill will have exactly that effect. I welcome what appears to be broad support for the measure.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.6/1">Following on from the earlier point about confidence, does the Minister agree that, although all the surveys indicate that confidence is at an all-time high, the challenge is investment? A Federation of Small Businesses survey has said that the measure will enable 28% of businesses to take on additional staff; that is what businesses want to do. Some 25% of those surveyed would invest in new machinery and equipment, and 21% in new staff training. That is exactly what we need; we need to turn confidence into a deliverable result.</p>

	<p pid="b.39.7/1">My hon. Friend raises an important point. I pay tribute to the work that she does on the all-party parliamentary group on micro-businesses. She provides</p>
	<p pid="b.39.7/2">a very strong voice in the House for smaller businesses, and she is absolutely right to do so. She is right to draw the House&#8217;s attention to the FSB survey. We have already talked about the contribution that the measure will make to the taking on of more staff, but where more staff are not taken on, there will very often be investment in the business, which will clearly help it to expand.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.7/3">The Bill cuts the jobs tax for 1.25 million employers and takes 450,000 of them out of employers&#8217; national insurance contributions altogether, making it less expensive for businesses to take on new staff, so the Bill will help job creation. It contains four main measures. We have touched on the employment allowance. I will also say something this afternoon about the fact that the Bill gives effect to the general anti-abuse rule on national insurance contributions. It also amends the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 to allow regulations to be made on the certification of non-UK employers of oil and gas workers, and makes changes in connection with two elements of the partnerships review carried out by Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. The Bill also makes a small number of technical corrections that I am happy to take the House through, should there be demand for that; if there is not, I am sure that we can cover them in some depth in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.7/4">Returning to the employment allowance, as part of our efforts to remove barriers to growth for businesses and to equip the UK economy to compete in the global race, the Chancellor announced in this year&#8217;s Budget the creation of a new employment allowance, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40209" name="Charlie Elphicke">the Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke)</phrase> pointed out. It will take effect from <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-06">6 April</phrase> next year. Businesses, charities and community amateur sports clubs in the UK will be entitled to a &#163;2,000-a-year allowance towards their employer national insurance contribution liability.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.7/5">The employment allowance builds on action that the Government have taken to make the tax system more competitive, and to encourage growth. That includes cutting corporation tax, increasing the rate of the research and development tax credit for small and medium-sized enterprises, increasing the annual investment allowance to &#163;250,000, and giving a cash-flow benefit to those who invest in plant and machinery.</p>
	<p pid="b.39.7/6">The objective of the employment allowance is to help businesses with the cost of employing their staff by reducing their employer class 1 national insurance contributions bill each year. It will support thousands of small businesses that aspire to grow, perhaps by hiring their first employee or expanding their work force, as well as those already employing others, or facing temporary cash-flow problems.</p>

The employment allowance is a UK-wide measure. Does that indicate that the Treasury has given up on its ambitions geographically to rebalance the UK economy?</p>

	<p pid="b.42.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a valuable point that is well worth highlighting. When running a deficit of the size that we were running, we face some tough decisions. We have taken a range of measures to reduce the deficit, and it has reduced by a third.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.0/2">Ultimately, though, whoever was in government was going to have to take these difficult decisions. If we are not prepared to take difficult decisions on spending&#8212;there is no evidence that Labour Members would do so&#8212;the answer is that we have to increase taxes. When we look around to see what taxes are available, it is clear that some very difficult decisions have to be made. Labour Members chose to go for employers&#8217; national insurance contributions; perhaps they considered that that option was less visible to the general public than some of the others. However, the consequences would have been higher unemployment, and this Government were not prepared to face that.</p>

Anyone who has studied recent Finance Acts closely will have seen that a whole range of measures have been introduced as a consequence of the OTS&#8217;s recommendations.

	<p pid="b.42.4/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. I want to turn to the employers&#8217; national insurance contributions holiday, because I suspect it will feature in the speeches of Opposition Members. They will make the point that take-up was not as high as we had anticipated. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Let me give the numbers: 26,000 employers and 90,000 employees have benefited from it. Our expectation was that take-up would be much higher. [Hon. Members: &#8220;How much?&#8221;] Don&#8217;t worry; I am going to set it out.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.4/2">We said that 400,000 businesses and 800,000 employees would benefit from the scheme. I think that the reason why that did not happen is closely aligned to what my hon. Friend has just pointed out: a scheme that was, essentially, quite targeted and required businesses to apply&#8212;even though we worked hard to try to make the application process as simple as possible&#8212;simply meant that fewer businesses applied for it than we had anticipated. Take-up was lower than expected and there are lessons to be learned from that. We should be open about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.42.4/3">We need a system that is simple and that can be applied easily. Under the new proposal, no application process is needed as such. Businesses will receive the benefit of the employment allowance simply by using up-to-date payroll, and the introduction of real-time information makes that much easier to apply. We believe that this is a much-improved policy. It contrasts with the employers&#8217; NICs holiday, because that was a targeted regime. It also contrasts both with the policy advocated by Labour in its five-point plan, which was even more targeted, and with the policy we heard about yesterday on the living wage. Complicated, temporary schemes requiring applications are likely to have disappointing levels of take-up, whereas permanent schemes automated through the payroll system will, we believe, apply much better.</p>

Perhaps the Labour party has not been listening to him because since that debate, it has proposed two NICs schemes, both of which are more complicated than the one that we had in place. If he is making the case for keeping NICs schemes simple, perhaps he ought to have a word with his party leader.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.2/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. It is worth bearing it in mind that tax plays an important role in the cost of living. If taxes are put up, it increases the pressure on the cost of living. Ultimately, that is where the policies of the Labour party would lead.</p>

	<p pid="b.44.4/1">My hon. Friend is right. The policy of providing a NICs break only for new employees raised all sorts of practical questions such as who constituted a new employee and what perverse incentives might have been created. That is not dissimilar to the point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James)</phrase> has made about Labour&#8217;s current policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/2">I will turn to the other elements of the Bill. Clauses 9 and 10 relate to the general anti-abuse rule. The Government announced at last year&#8217;s Budget that they accepted the recommendation of the Aaronson report to introduce a GAAR targeted at abusive tax avoidance schemes. The GAAR was introduced in part 5 of the Finance Act 2013 and has been in force since July. This Bill will apply the GAAR to national insurance contributions.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/3">Clause 11 relates to oil and gas workers. In this year&#8217;s Budget, the Chancellor announced that the Government would strengthen the legislation on offshore employment intermediaries. The Bill will address the non-payment of employer&#8217;s national insurance contributions in the oil and gas industry through the placement of the employer of oil and gas workers who are working on the UK continental shelf outside the UK. The measure has been subject to consultation. The consultation document, &#8220;Offshore employment intermediaries&#8221;, was published on <phrase class="date" code="2013-05-30">30 May 2013</phrase> and the consultation closed on <phrase class="date" code="2013-08-08">8 August 2013</phrase>. The summary of responses was published in October.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/4">The Government intend to address those offshore employment schemes largely by using existing powers contained in social security legislation. The Bill supplements those with a new certification provision for the oil and gas industry. That provision will apply where the national</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/5">insurance obligations are fulfilled by someone on behalf of the person deemed to be the employer for national insurance purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/6">Clause 11 is part of a measure that, as a whole, is expected to bring in the region of &#163;100 million per year to the Exchequer, without having a significant economic impact on the oil and gas industry. Staff costs for some businesses may increase if they had not previously been accounting properly for all tax and NICs. There will be little cost to the Government through additional administration, other than HMRC implementing the new certification system, and I hope hon. Members will agree that this is a straightforward and uncontroversial provision.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/7">Finally, I wish to refer to provisions in the Bill concerning HMRC&#8217;s partnership review, which are contained in clauses 12 and 13. Following the Chancellor&#8217;s Budget announcement, HMRC carried out a consultation on two aspects of the partnership rules between May and August this year, and the Government are bringing forward measures in the Bill as a result of that review. The Government are proposing two sets of changes, the first of which was not part of the consultation proposals but resulted directly from information received during that consultation. It concerns a tax issue that can arise from the interaction of the alternative investment fund managers directive&#8212;AIFMD&#8212;and existing partnership tax rules. Only those alternative investment fund managers who operate as a partnership will be affected by the proposed changes in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/8">A provision in the Bill will allow regulations to be made to modify the class 4 NICS liability of partners whose profits will be deferred under AIFMD, which aims to improve investor protection and reduce risk. The regulations will be based on new tax legislation that will be included in the forthcoming finance Bill. Measures will be included in the NICs Bill, the forthcoming finance Bill and secondary legislation to reclassify certain limited liability partnership&#8212;or LLP&#8212;members as employed earners for tax and national insurance purposes, to tackle the disguising of employment relationships through LLPs.</p>
	<p pid="b.44.4/9">The tax and NICs changes are expected to bring in approximately &#163;125 million to the Exchequer in the first year, while the broader economic impact is expected to be negligible. There will be changes to the NICs liability for certain partnerships and individual partners in the alternative investment fund sector. The Bill will also result in some LLPs in certain industry sectors where disguised employment has been most prevalent paying increased amounts of NICs.</p>

	<p pid="b.46.2/1">That was a valiant effort to change the subject, but today we are talking about this Minister&#8217;s record and the regional national insurance holiday plan. I note that the Minister could not bring himself to admit that the Opposition were right and that he was wrong about that. Perhaps we can return to that point later.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.2/2">The Minister sought to focus as much as he could on the employment allowance and desperately tried to forget its predecessor scheme that the Government introduced in their 2010 emergency Budget&#8212;the regional national insurance holiday, which was enacted in the National Insurance Contributions Act 2011. The national insurance holiday was an abject failure, so I am not surprised that he wants to pretend it never happened, but it did, and it failed utterly. He has wasted three years clinging to that policy rather than doing what Opposition Members told him to do, which was to rip it up and design a new scheme that took account of the criticisms made by us and others.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.2/3">The Bill introduces the employment allowance, which we support, so perhaps we should give the Minister credit for getting there in the end, but it is somewhat difficult to do so, because it has taken him far too long to rectify the flaws of the previous scheme, which we warned him about from the beginning, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> has reminded him. As a result, businesses desperate for help have struggled in the meantime.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.2/4">Those businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the engine of our economy, have continued to suffer. Bank lending to SMEs is still contracting, and analysis published by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills shows that tightening credit has disproportionately affected low and average-risk SMEs. Last year, Project Merlin missed its target for</p>
	<p pid="b.46.2/5">lending to SMEs by more than &#163;1 billion. In 2010, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicted that lending to businesses would have risen 34% by now, but in fact it has fallen by 10%.</p>
	<p pid="b.46.2/6">Given this climate of the past three years, action has been necessary to support business, but, on national insurance, it has taken the Government too long to get there.</p>

	<p pid="b.47.7/1">We have been speaking a great deal about rebalancing the economy and our proposals on regional banking, for example, are proof that we take the issue seriously. The hon. Gentleman described</p>
	<p pid="b.47.7/2">this Government&#8217;s policy as a statement of intent, but it was an absolute failure, and that is the subject of the debate today.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.7/3">The national insurance holiday was a flagship policy of the Government&#8217;s first Budget, which is why they are so desperate to forget that it happened. They created a scheme that ran from <phrase class="date" code="2010-09-06">6 September 2010</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-05">5 September 2013</phrase> and applied to new businesses only. They were eligible only if they were created after <phrase class="date" code="2010-06-22">22 June 2010</phrase>. Under that scheme, new businesses would not have to pay the first &#163;5,000 in national insurance for each of their first 10 employees during the first year of the business. Greater London, the south-east and the eastern region were all excluded from the scheme. The Government said that 400,000 businesses and some 800,000 employees would benefit from the national insurance holiday, at a cost of &#163;940 million over the three years of the scheme. In their impact assessment, the Government confidently predicted that the average benefit per business would be about &#163;2,000, but by the end of the three years of the national insurance holiday in September this year, the scheme was shown to have been a comprehensive failure.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.7/4">In the end, only 25,000 businesses received NICS relief&#8212;that is 375,000 fewer businesses being helped than the Government originally claimed. It was always highly unlikely to have ever been worth the maximum &#163;50,000 to a new start-up business. To get the maximum relief available, the new businesses would have had to take on 10 people with salaries of up to &#163;40,000, which does not exactly fit the pattern of how new start-ups behave and the sorts of choices that they make in their first year of business.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.7/5">Of the &#163;940 million set aside to pay for the scheme, only &#163;60 million was ultimately paid out, a paltry 6% of the amount originally intended. To put that in context, the Government spent &#163;12 million on the administration of the scheme. We repeatedly warned that the scheme was not working, that it was not helping businesses as intended and that the Government should reform it, expand it, review it or bring forward a new one, but they refused to listen.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.7/6">It is not as though the Minister could not see the failure unfolding before his eyes. Take-up of the national insurance holiday was never anything other than dismal. In the first year of the scheme, there was not one month in which HMRC received more than 850 applications. In 2012, there was only one month when the total number of successful applications was more than 1,000&#8212;that was in May 2012, when there were 1,130 successful applications. For the Government&#8217;s scheme to succeed, they would have needed to hit that number every month for three years, and they got nowhere near that.</p>
	<p pid="b.47.7/7">When the Treasury Committee conducted its inquiry into the June 2010 Budget, the Chair of the Committee said:</p>
	<p pid="b.47.7/8">&#8220;For those of us who have been on the circuit a while it sounds like another case of the triumph of hope over experience.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.49.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is somewhat confused. As was pointed out earlier, we always said that one of the problems with the scheme was the regional element, and I am coming to that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.49.0/2">During the passage of the National Insurance Contributions Act 2011, we told the Minister that he should drop the regional condition attached to the national insurance holiday and expand it to areas of the UK that had been excluded. Today, he brings to the House the employment allowance, which does exactly that. In fact, the Government&#8217;s analysis, published this morning, shows that more than 40% of the expected total number of employers who will not pay any NICs under the employment allowance are based in regions excluded from the previous scheme. At the time, the Minister said that extending the national insurance holiday across the UK would increase the cost by approximately &#163;600 million to a total of &#163;1.6 billion over three years. Today, his employment allowance is predicted to cost &#163;1.3 billion in the first year, rising to &#163;1.7 billion by 2017-18. We said that the national insurance holiday should be extended to cover all businesses, rather than simply new ones. Today, the Minister is introducing an employment allowance that covers all businesses, not just new businesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.1/1">I am sorry that the hon. Gentleman is so depressed that his Government&#8217;s policy has failed, but that is not a matter for me.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/2">We will seek reassurance from the Government and test the Bill&#8217;s provisions to ensure that the new scheme does not suffer from the problems associated with the previous scheme. In particular, we will scrutinise its administration. The national insurance holiday was too complicated and the employment allowance should not suffer from the same problems. One problem affecting take-up of the previous scheme, in addition to its complexity, was the lack of publicity. Many businesses simply did not know what was available. This problem must not be repeated. This is particularly important when it comes to publicising the scheme to charities and amateur sports clubs, to which it now also applies. They are more likely to be unaware of what is available, and the Government should have a clear publicity strategy, subject to review, if take-up is, for whatever reason, lower than expected.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/3">Clauses 9 and 10 apply the general anti-abuse rule to national insurance contributions, and enable the Treasury to ensure that the GAAR, as it applies to national insurance and to tax, is kept in line.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/4">We support the application of the GAR to national insurance, but we remain unconvinced that the current version is up to the job. It is the Government&#8217;s flagship policy for tackling tax avoidance, and their figures show that it will result in annual revenue of &#163;60 million in 2014-15, which they expect to rise to &#163;85 million by 2017-18, but that compares with a tax gap that was estimated, when the GAR was introduced, to be &#163;32.2 billion but which has now risen to &#163;35 billion. Have the Government thought about reassessing their figures in the light of the slightly over-enthusiastic estimates made for the UK-Swiss tax agreement? Anyway, a dent of &#163;85 million in a tax gap of &#163;35 billion is nothing to write home about.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/5">The House will recall that two months ago, a member of the GAR independent advisory panel, which decides whether people have broken the rule, was forced to resign, shortly after the GAR came into operation, having been caught advising people at a tax-planning conference how to keep their money</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/6">&#8220;out of the Chancellor&#8217;s grubby mitts&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/7">This was someone who was hand-picked to advise Ministers on the avoidance schemes the GAR should catch. We remain concerned, therefore, that the GAR is far too narrow, that there is no specific penalty regime, that no arrangements are in place to monitor its effectiveness and that, as a result, it has little credibility. We will continue to press these arguments when the Bill reaches Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.50.1/8">We welcome the introduction of a certification scheme for offshore employers of oil and gas workers. The extent of this problem is significant, with at least 100,000 individuals having been found to be employed through an intermediary company with no presence, residence or place of business in the UK. I note that this is the first of three measures aimed at tackling this issue. We await the introduction of the other two by way of secondary legislation and provisions to be included in the Finance Bill. We know from analysis published alongside the Bill, that the changes, as a whole, are expected to result in Exchequer savings of &#163;80 million to &#163;100 million a year, and we will wish to review the effectiveness of these provisions as and when they come into force.</p>

	<p pid="b.51.1/1">I absolutely reject the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point. We have a very good record on tackling tax avoidance, and as I said, at the moment I do not think that the GAR is anything to write home about. We have significant issues with it, but we will return to those points in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/2">Clauses 12 and 13 make provisions for partnership arrangements, which we support. We welcome the regulations that will prevent the misuse of partnerships for the purpose of tax avoidance by focusing specifically on two issues. The first concerns partnerships and the tax-motivated allocation of profits and losses relating to the alternative investment fund managers directive, and the second concerns limited liability partnerships and the nature of the relationship between partners and the LLP.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/3">Focusing on the second issue, the current HMRC interpretation of the existing tax rules has meant that individuals who are members of an LLP are taxed as though they are partners in a partnership, meaning that low-paid workers taken on as LLP members have lost employment benefits and protections, while, at the other end of the scale, high-paid workers have benefited from a self-employed status and the resulting loss of employment taxes payable. It is time for the use of LLPs as a way to disguise employment status and avoid employment taxes to stop. We note that the Budget report estimated that the Exchequer gains would be &#163;125 million in 2014-15, rising to &#163;365 million in 2015-16, and we support action in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/4">In conclusion, key aspects of the Bill began life as Labour party policy, so I suppose I should thank the Exchequer Secretary for giving us the rare pleasure of enacting legislation from opposition. It is a first for me, but one that I hope will happen many more times. The national insurance holiday scheme was a complete failure, and it is vital that the employment allowance gives businesses the support they need, but it is unacceptable that they will have been waiting four years for this support. Three of those years were wasted while he and the Government clung to the national insurance holiday scheme, and almost another year has been wasted as they have failed to take immediate action, instead introducing the employment allowance only from next</p>
	<p pid="b.51.1/5">April. Even when forced to change course and do the right thing, they are still failing to go far enough and act quickly enough. Businesses up and down the country deserve better.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.0/1">I warmly welcome the proposals in the Bill. We have already heard the statistics on its impact, including that 90% of the money involved will go to companies with fewer than 50 employees. That represents real help for small businesses up and down the country. I also welcome the fact that it will be much simpler to apply for the allowance, and that businesses will no longer have the kind of issues they are experiencing with the present scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.0/2">It is certainly true that people and businesses respond to financial incentives, and it is no wonder that national insurance is sometimes called a jobs tax, because it can be a disincentive to employing people. It raises the bar to employing people and, given the importance of creating jobs in our economy, it is great to see that bar coming down. The Federation of Small Businesses has stated that the Bill will affect not only jobs; investment will also increase, as will the pay of the staff. I warmly welcome the FSB&#8217;s conclusion. Let us contrast these measures with the previous Government&#8217;s proposed 1% increase for employers and employees in April 2011. The independent Centre for Economics and Business Research said that that measure would have taken 57,000 jobs out of our economy&#8212;proving the point that national insurance can indeed be a big incentive either to employ people or fire them.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.0/3">I welcome the proposals relating to offshore oil and gas employees. Quite a number of them live in my constituency, and many have had great difficulty with the intermediary companies that employ them. The confused nature of the national insurance arrangements can cause them personal issues when they start to claim pensions, for example, so I welcome the simplifying measures and look forward to the remaining measures required to give offshore oil and gas workers the right status in our economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.0/4">The tax avoidance measures are also welcome. They are part of an ongoing campaign by the Government, who have already increased by 2,500 the number of staff employed to deal with tax avoidance and evasion. There is a lot more to be done, but we should all warmly welcome clauses 9 and 10, which will apply the general anti-abuse rule. This will prevent offshore payroll companies from avoiding national insurance.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.2/1">Very little. We heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" name="Shabana Mahmood">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase> that the measure will not bring in an enormous amount. It will, however, remove the loophole that has been used by many companies, including some of our merchant banks, to pay their staff offshore as a technique for avoiding national insurance. We have to welcome any measures that will improve that situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.2/2">I want to ask the Minister for clarification following the 2011 Budget announcement that tax and national insurance would be simplified and that work would be done to bring them together. We have long since lost the</p>
	<p pid="b.52.2/3">hypothecation of national insurance, and I wonder whether we could simplify the arrangements a lot more than we are doing at the moment. I hope he will respond to that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.2/4">The Bill is part of a big package aimed at supporting small and medium-sized businesses. Corporation tax is down from 28% to 23%, and it is heading for a rate of 20% by 2015. A new business bank has been proposed, along with other lending schemes. There has been a response to the Lib Dem campaign to increase capital allowances, which went up tenfold in the last Budget. That is particularly helping small manufacturing companies to increase their investment in equipment. The one in, two out policy on regulation is also a great help, as is the setting of small business rate relief at 100% for two and a half years. Those measures and more are driving the economy forward, and have now created 1.4 million jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.2/5">Last week, a shadow Minister described his party as the party of small businesses. The laughter that greeted his statement almost brought the house down. If we look at what could have been done in 13 years and what this Government have done in three short years, it is quite clear to see who is out there supporting small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.2/6">The Opposition propose a business rate freeze, which would give small businesses about &#163;450 over two years. These measures give businesses &#163;4,000 over two years&#8212;almost 10 times as much. They are certainly a great help to small businesses. We have heard about the FSB supporting them, and about the Small Charities Coalition doing the same, while the CBI has also welcomed them. If there is a coalition of those organisations, we know we are doing something right.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.2/7">This Government are continuing to sort out the mess left by the Opposition, and the Bill will help to create jobs in our economy, will strengthen it and will make the national insurance system fairer.</p>

As so often when members of his party speak in these debates, they talk about what was happening to the economy in the period before the general election and after it as if they were two completely different things. Many of the views the hon.

Now that we are three and a half years into this Government, that seems somewhat strange. To me, it looks like diversionary tactics. Government Members are saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s not talk about what we&#8217;ve done; let&#8217;s hark back yet again not just to the previous Government, but to proposals that never even came into effect&#8221;, suggesting that those proposals were somehow the cause of our economic difficulties.

	<p pid="b.54.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention, but I am certainly not going to say that many of my constituents did not benefit from the record of the last Government, and I am not going to accept her characterisation of that Government as not having helped the majority of people in this country. Yes, I have spoken to local businesses, and many of them have been struggling, particularly over the last three and a half years, to get loan finance to get their businesses functioning. Many have found it extremely difficult to operate in an economy that has been sent into decline by many of the measures that the incoming Government imposed. The picture presented by the hon. Lady is wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/2">As I was saying, the concentration on what happened during the last Labour Government is a reflection of the fact that this Government know that their previous proposals on national insurance contributions simply did not work. We have heard a lot about predictions, and some people have suggested that the Opposition&#8217;s predictions about the economy were wrong, so the Government&#8217;s predictions, presumably by extension, must be right.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/3">However, what the Government told us in 2010 and 2011 was that they were going to eliminate, not just reduce, the deficit over the course of one Parliament. What we now hear over and over again is that the deficit has been reduced by one third, but it seems to have reached a plateau. That figure of one third has been invoked for a very long time now, which suggests that the Government&#8217;s original intentions and purposes have not been achieved. They have clearly accepted not only that they will not eliminate the deficit by 2015, but that everything has stalled and that deficit reduction has, as I say, reached a plateau. In 2010-11, it was predicted that we would see economic growth in 2010-12, not that we would be still waiting for it in 2013. Even now, the amount of growth we are seeing is very limited.</p>

	<p pid="b.54.2/1">We do not know that that policy would have taken jobs out of the economy, because we did not have the opportunity to implement it.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/2">Another issue that is subject to repeated predictions is jobs. The number of new private sector jobs is constantly being put at about 1.4 million, but, interestingly, in January 2011 the Government were already saying that 500,000 jobs had been created. It is clear to anyone that even if those figures are accurate, and even if factors such as the re-categorisation of jobs into different sectors are taken into account, the pace of job creation is not quite as dramatic or as effective as we might think.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/3">We were told that the earlier proposal for a national insurance holiday was intended to create jobs. The fascinating aspect of that was the very low take-up. If all those new employers had set up new companies and provided new jobs, why did they not want to take advantage of it? Why did so few come forward? That surely casts doubt on the notion that numerous people were desperate to start up new businesses and to take on employees. In December 2012, there were only 20,365 applicants for the scheme. The Minister has told us that eventually there were 26,000, but the initial prediction was 400,000. There is a considerable difference between those figures.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/4">It is not surprising that the Minister was reluctant to respond to interventions from his own Back Benchers and to say what he thought might be the outcome of his current proposals, because he knows how poor earlier predictions have been. It is not just in respect of the national insurance holiday that predictions have been wildly at odds with the reality. For example, the youth contract, which involved offering money to employers to take on people aged between 18 and 25, was apparently going to be one of the major answers to youth unemployment. It was designed, we were told, to help 53,000 young people per year. However, in the first year of its operation it helped only 4,690. That was another not very successful policy that we had been asked to believe would help people in an important way. In that context, I think it significant that only last week the Work and Pensions Committee heard from the CBI that it would have liked to see extra money for training, rather than cash incentives for employers to take on young people. Perhaps the Government should listen to what people think would help create jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/5">The Institute for Fiscal Studies has pointed out that the current proposals do not guarantee any additional jobs and that this is simply a tax cut. A tax cut may be beneficial and may bring about more jobs, but in itself it will not necessarily do so. Again, I would point to the previous record. The IFS says we do not know whether this proposal will have any effect on job creation as it will not be piloted and will be almost impossible to evaluate, and that we will therefore be unlikely to know whether it will be money well spent. We must bear in mind the previous history, which I have mentioned, of two schemes that both failed to help create employment, and we must ask the Government to monitor and evaluate this new proposal as much as they can if they are going to introduce it.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/6">The Government must realise that the creation of jobs is extremely important for many parts of this country. Many Government members and Back Benchers have expressed pleasure at the reductions in unemployment in their own constituencies, which is all very well, but unemployment levels in many parts of the country are still extremely high. What is even more important for many people is the lack of quality jobs and the fact that they often cannot work the number of hours they want to. We currently have the highest recorded level of people working part time who want to work more hours. That means people have low incomes and are often dependent on top-ups from Government benefits.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/7">The Government sometimes wonder why things like housing benefit keep going up rather than down, despite the reforms they put in place. The main reason is that</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/8">people in part-time, low-income jobs on zero-hour contracts have no choice but to apply for such benefits, so even the jobs that are out there are often ones that leave people with a cost-of-living crisis. That causes real suffering, and there is no point in pretending otherwise.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.2/9">I ask the Government to indicate the likely take-up of this scheme&#8212;reluctant though they are to do&#8212;and to accept that their previous measures in this field have not been successful. Three years on, their initiatives have simply not been successful, and we see the results in the state of our economy today. Of course it is good that growth is beginning to return, but such low-level growth after such a long time can hardly be hailed as a success. If we want to argue about whose predictions were right, perhaps, at best, we have to say that nobody&#8217;s were. The Government&#8217;s predictions on coming to power in 2010 were certainly not borne out, and people have been suffering the results of that in the past three years.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.0/1">Before I come to my main points about this Bill, which I support, I would just like to follow on from the speech of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" name="Sheila Gilmore">the hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore)</phrase> and talk about the big picture for a few minutes. One can quibble about the benefits or otherwise of this scheme or that one, but the Government&#8217;s economic policies and interventions have contributed to Britain becoming the fastest-growing country in the western world. Survey after survey confirms the figures, which are extremely optimistic about this economy. I sometimes think the Treasury team is, with characteristic self-effacement, almost cautious in putting forward the record of this Government in full technicolour, so I would like to take up that role this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/2">The Bill is a straightforward and simple measure, top-slicing &#163;2,000 off every company&#8217;s employer national insurance bill. As such, it will provide significant help to small businesses. I have 5,200 small and medium-sized enterprises in my constituency, and I welcome this measure on behalf of them all. We have heard the quotes from various organisations representing small businesses, social enterprises and so on welcoming the measure. The fact that it has such independent support ought to speak for itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/3">I also wish to draw attention to the ambitious sole trader. The SMEs will have their employer insurance bills cut, but we also need to consider the small sole trader who is ambitious and wants one day to grow his or her business, just as I did. When I started my business in the 1980s, it consisted just of my business partner and me&#8212;everyone else who helped was begged, stolen or borrowed. I well remember the agony of the decision to appoint the first paid member of staff. One knows that one has to do it at some point if one wants to grow the business, but the responsibility that comes from knowing that someone walking through the door is then dependent for their livelihood on the success of one&#8217;s business really makes one stop and think. Anything that makes that decision easier, as this Bill does, has to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/4">I wish to talk about a young woman in my constituency, Amy Fairley, who has a passion for flowers. She worked in a florist&#8217;s shop until about six month ago, when she was made redundant. She decided to follow her passion and dream by setting up her own florist&#8217;s shop. She did</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/5">that with help from the new enterprise allowance scheme&#8212;another good scheme&#8212;and a Prince&#8217;s Trust grant and the mentorship that the Prince&#8217;s Trust also provides. I helped her to open her wonderful florist&#8217;s shop on Coventry street in Stourbridge three weeks ago. As a Prince&#8217;s Trust mentor for four years before I was elected, I have had similar experience and I was always reluctant to advise on taking on that first member of staff, because of the cost and the risk. One wonders whether the member of staff will be needed all the time, although, of course, they could be taken on part-time. The Bill will mitigate that caution.</p>
	<p pid="b.56.0/6">I also wish to make the point that the Bill is part of a package of measures designed to help employment and small businesses. The reforms to employment law are also crucial, because this is not just about the cost of taking someone on; it is also about the fear that if the wrong person is appointed, the business is in for a huge headache. The Government&#8217;s doubling of the qualifying period before people can make unfair dismissal claims to two years is a huge advantage, as is the fact that they are making settlement agreements easier, obviating the need for employment tribunals, which are expensive in many cases. I know from my work as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Green that the Government have invested hugely in UK Trade &amp; Investment and UK Export Finance, again for the development of specific programmes to support small businesses with their exports.</p>

	<p pid="b.57.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. Indeed, what he has observed might explain why British exports to China have risen at a record rate in the past 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/2">Another aspect of Government support for the small businesses that are crucial to employment and many of the new jobs that have been created has been the reduction in the small companies tax rate to 20%. The small business rate relief scheme was doubled until <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-14">14 April</phrase> and we have also had the start-up loans scheme and the new enterprise allowance, which I have already mentioned. All those measures were designed to have, and have had, a positive effect on the livelihood of our small businesses.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/3">Of course, not just employers have benefited from such measures. Employees have benefited too. In my constituency, 3,794 people have been removed from income tax altogether. A vast number of people in my constituency&#8212;33,000&#8212;are now paying less tax and that is an important development, freeing people to spend more money on the high street, which is where the economy is starting to grow again.</p>
	<p pid="b.57.3/4">It is instructive to recall the Opposition&#8217;s record. The shadow Business Secretary makes the laughable claim that Labour is now the party of small business, but I think that small business people judge Governments, Oppositions and former Governments on their actions, not their words. The Opposition have a long way to go before they can put themselves up as people who understand the needs of businesses. As I said earlier, I think that it was indicative of their deeply flawed management of our economy that they felt in 2011 that they needed to put up taxes by putting up national insurance, rather than cutting public spending, which, of course, is what&#8212;only the other day&#8212;Tony Blair said they should have done. We all know how the economy ended up.</p>

	<p pid="b.58.1/1">I would apologise if I felt that I had said that no taxes had gone up. Let me clarify in response to that intervention. I was making the point that the previous Government proposed to increase national insurance, presumably because they could not face the public expenditure cuts that this country really needed. The hon. Lady is quite right that the Government were driven to put up VAT, but the important point is that in getting a grip on the public finances we had a rough ratio. Spending cuts delivered approximately two thirds of what was required and the tax increases, regrettable though they were, were necessary and delivered the other third. I fear I digress somewhat, Madam Deputy Speaker, and I feel your watchful gaze so I shall return to the subject of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.58.2/1">It is truly a great pleasure to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James)</phrase>, who is a mighty champion for our small businesses that are trying to access international markets. It is no wonder that her region leads the country in increasing exports to developing and developed nations around the world. She spoke most eloquently about the benefits for small businesses and echoed some of the points made by my hon. Friend the Minister about the impact of the Bill on the willingness of employers to add to their labour force.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.2/2">I want to focus on the Bill&#8217;s impact not on the quantity of people who will be employed but on the price of labour, and on how the Bill might be used to implement some of the efforts to create a living wage across the United Kingdom. The Treasury team have come across a useful tool in implementing that change, and it is up to them to see how much courage they might have to move forward with this initiative to achieve it. That marks the difference between those on the Opposition Benches, who wish to posture over changes in the economy on employment and wages, and Government Members, who are interested in taking action to achieve change.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.2/3">If I may, I shall consider the record of the previous Labour Government. As we have heard often today, the Labour Government were interested in increasing the tax on employment, and indeed went into the general election calling for increases in the jobs tax. Despite the words we have heard today, we have not heard one word of apology from the Labour party for saying at the last election that the right way to increase employment was to increase the tax on jobs. Still no apology on that, but it was part of a pattern that impacted negatively on the price of employment.</p>
	<p pid="b.58.2/4">Labour abolished the 10p tax rate. It created a tax credits system that was an incredibly complex way to give people a post-tax income on which they could live. Any of us with constituents who have been caught up with tax credits when they went wrong knows how hard it is for families when the tax credits office claws those tax credits back and savings have to be found.

	<p pid="b.59.1/2">Underpinning that system was Labour&#8217;s creation of a benefits system that discouraged work. We had hundreds of thousands of workers in our country going out to work on the minimum wage or a little more and seeing people living on benefits when they could have worked and ending up with a lifestyle that those people in work could not afford. Labour has not apologised for that policy and has opposed even the benefits cap.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.3/1">The hon. Lady makes a point, but not a particularly good one. If the economy was borrowing so much money to stimulate employment, it was not a particularly outstanding outcome to achieve an increase in one part of the labour force of 350,000, especially when we consider the fact that every Labour Government have left office with unemployment higher than when they came to office.</p>

	<p pid="b.59.6/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way again and being so generous with his time. That myth about every Labour Government leaving office with unemployment higher than when it came to office is not entirely accurate. For example, unemployment was extremely low at the end of the period in office of the 1945-51 Labour Government. Under the Tory Governments of 1979 to 1997, unemployment was more than 10% in the majority of those years.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.0/1">The hon. Lady is digressing significantly from the Bill to talk about 1945, but in any debate I am more than happy&#8212; <i>[Interruption.]</i> Labour Front Benchers want to make an argument about how good the Labour party is in office at reducing unemployment. The facts are the facts: Labour comes to office and when it leaves, unemployment is higher.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.0/2">To return to the impact of the Bill on improving wage rates, let us consider the record of the coalition in government. We are in the process of raising the personal allowance to &#163;10,000. I shall return to that point. We are targeting and simplifying tax credits and other benefits. We have introduced a benefit cap, making work pay. With this Bill, we are introducing an employment allowance, which will provide greater opportunity for us to improve wage rates. The living wage is a crucial issue that Members on both sides of the House should embrace. We should all endeavour to find ways to improve wages for those who are unskilled or on low pay. For many decades, real wages for people who are unskilled have been stagnant, or rising at a very low rate. One benefit of the introduction of higher wages is the potential that many businesses will see for higher productivity. Most importantly, if very small businesses are able to pay higher wages, there is reduced staff turnover. That is particularly important where there is low pay across a profession.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.0/3">I looked at the Bill with great interest to see how it could provide a solid basis for an answer to the question, &#8220;How do we implement the living wage in practice?&#8221;. Tomorrow, we will hear from the Leader of the Opposition about his approach. It was interesting that the shadow Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" name="Shabana Mahmood">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase>, said that one-off policies were a bad idea when it came to persuading businesses to take up a new Government scheme, but a one-off policy is precisely what the Leader of the Opposition will propose tomorrow as his approach to the living wage. If it does not work for national insurance contributions, how on earth will it work for substantial wage changes by employers? The problem with the Leader of the Opposition is that he just does not understand business.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.1/1">Order. I have allowed the hon.

I would be grateful if he stuck to that.</p>

	<p pid="b.60.2/1">You read my mind, Madam Deputy Speaker. I shall return directly to the implications of the measure for the living wage and wage rates. Let me give some numbers showing the impact of a change from the minimum wage to the living wage, and say how the Bill can help to achieve that change for the long term.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/2">Let us consider what happens when a married person who works 40 hours a week, has two teenage children, and earns the minimum wage, which is &#163;6.31, moves to the living wage, which today went up to &#163;7.65. I am using the numbers for outside London, because I represent Bedford, which is outside London. The employee&#8217;s gross pay would increase from &#163;13,125 to &#163;15,912&#8212;an increase of 21%. After the changes to their tax, national insurance and tax credits, their net take-home pay, which is what matters to them, increases from &#163;15,067 to &#163;16,483&#8212;a</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/3">welcome increase, but an increase of only 9%. That is the impact on the family of the change from the minimum wage to the living wage.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/4">Looking at the cost to the employer, there is an increase in salary of &#163;2,787, and an increase in the employer&#8217;s national insurance contributions of &#163;385; that is essentially a 23% increase in the cost of employing that person. Then there is the impact on the Exchequer. It benefits from an increase in income tax of &#163;557, and an increase in the employee national insurance contribution of &#163;335. The reduction in the payment of tax credits benefits the Exchequer by &#163;479, and the increase in employer national insurance benefits it by &#163;385. The Exchequer ends up increasing its tax take by 32%. The change from the minimum wage to the living wage means a modest but welcome increase for the employee, has a high cost for the employer, and brings a substantial benefit, on my calculations, for the Exchequer.</p>
	<p pid="b.60.2/5">In that context, let me say this about the Government&#8217;s use of the employment allowance to give something back to our hard-pressed employers and small businesses: &#163;2,000 is a start, but we have found a tool here, if we have the courage to use it, that we can use to encourage&#8212;not compel&#8212;our private sector employers to accept a living wage. Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs could act as a compliance officer for those who seek to pay the living wage, as it does for the minimum wage. We could pay back some of the significant gain to the Exchequer that my simple calculation has brought up, though I am sure that there are more complicated numbers out there. There is a useful tool here, and this is a small start. Let us have the courage to see how we can improve living conditions and wages for our low-paid workers, and use the Bill as the start of a better future for all of us.</p>

	<p pid="b.61.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this important debate, and to follow such an array of wide-ranging, informative, quality contributions from my hon. Friends and colleagues. The Bill is a key part of a wider programme that the Government have undertaken to support aspiration, encourage job creation, and boost growth. As a small business owner, I am proud to speak in support of a policy that will help firms around the country to expand, innovate and, crucially, create jobs. To put it simply, the Bill is great for small businesses, great for charities, and great for Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/2">As we have heard, the key part of the Bill will save all businesses in the country up to &#163;2,000 in class 1 national insurance contributions. Taking a tax off jobs will make it much easier for millions of people who have set up firms to take on new employees. Do not take my word for it; Anne Redston, professor of law at King&#8217;s College London, says:</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/3">&#8220;At a stroke, this new relief&#8230;removes the &#8216;jobs tax&#8217; on millions of small businesses, and is likely to encourage one-man businesses to take on their first employee.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.61.0/4">What is more, 98% of the benefits of the change will go to small and medium-sized enterprises. As we have heard, 450,000 small businesses&#8212;one third of all the employers in the country&#8212;will pay no jobs tax at all.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a key point. The fact that the measure is open to charities and social enterprises, as well as businesses, is really important. That is another step in the right direction by the Government to make it easier for small firms and charities to take on new employees. This is not just about business; the head of policy and research at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, Karl Wilding, says that the idea is</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/2">&#8220;a very positive thing&#8230;To a small organisation, &#163;2,000 is a lot of money.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/3">He is absolutely right. When I set up my business at the age of 19, &#163;2,000 would have been a massive incentive to take the big step of hiring my first member of staff.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James)</phrase> spoke powerfully about her experiences of starting up a business. As she said, taking on that first member of staff is a really big moment&#8212;a huge decision. It is a massive responsibility; the person hiring becomes responsible for someone&#8217;s income, livelihood and wages.</p>

	<p pid="b.62.2/1">And their family. I am pleased that the Bill makes that moment so much more likely. There are many statistics that show how great an impact the change will have. We have heard some amazingly powerful statistics this afternoon; for example, over a year, employers with fewer than 10 employees will have their national insurance contribution bill cut by 80%. However, it is easy to get bogged down in figures. What does the Bill mean for charities and small businesses up and down the country? It means that the small-time cupcake seller who works out of their kitchen and wants to expand, but is not sure that they can afford to, is now &#163;2,000 more likely to give a young person their first foot on the jobs ladder. It means that the mechanic who needs another pair of hands to deal with a recent increase in demand can take someone on and pay them up to &#163;22,000 without having to pay any jobs tax. It means that the Government are continuing to deliver exactly the kind of policies that have, so far, created 1.4 million private sector jobs and put the country on the path to prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.2/2">There are so many ways in which the Government have helped small businesses to flourish. Locally, I have been involved in a really successful regional growth fund bid&#8212;a partnership between <i>The News</i>, which is our local newspaper, and the Solent local enterprise partnership. The Bridging the Gap scheme is a pot of money that new start-ups and small firms can bid for to help grow their business and create jobs. I recently visited three of the Bridging the Gap success stories in my constituency, including Kev Jones and Son, an independent convenience store at the heart of the community, which is, you will be interested to hear, Madam Deputy Speaker, the go-to shop for your Christmas meat hamper. The people there had very ambitious plans to expand. With a little bit of extra money, they were able to bring those plans forward, and they have now doubled their floor space and created some of the new jobs the area so desperately needs. These are exactly the kinds of businesses that we will be supporting through this Bill. That is absolutely the right thing to</p>
	<p pid="b.62.2/3">do, because they are not just the backbone of our economy but the lifeblood of our communities. The Bill is a key part of the wider programme to make Britain the most small-business-friendly environment in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.2/4">By cutting Labour&#8217;s deficit, the Government have secured record low interest rates for hard-working families and small businesses across the country. From April 2015, corporation tax will be cut to 20%&#8212;the lowest in the G20. As a result of the Government&#8217;s policies, the UK recently topped KPMG&#8217;s list of the most competitive countries in which to do business, beating Switzerland, the USA and France for the first time ever. This hard work is getting results. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics showed strong growth of 0.8% for the third quarter of 2013. That proves that the only way to create real prosperity and to raise living standards is not through quick-fix gimmicks but through straightforward solutions: backing businesses to create growth, cutting taxes to boost growth, and supporting hard-working people.</p>
	<p pid="b.62.2/5">Labour Members have presented this as being somehow their idea. That appears to show brass neck of almost biblical proportions. Anyone who ran a business under the previous Labour Government, as I did for 13 years, will know that we were shackled by endless amounts of bureaucracy as the country fell deeper into debt and slipped down the international competitive league tables. We cannot escape the fact that they got it very badly wrong on the economy as well. They said we would lose 1 million jobs. Instead, we have seen the creation of 1 million net jobs&#8212;three in the private sector for every one lost in the public sector. Because this Government have cut taxes, slashed red tape and unleashed innovation, we have seen record levels of small business creation and employment. I am confident that the Government will continue to deliver the right policies.</p>

	<p pid="b.63.2/1">Because I lost a contact lens on the tube, Madam Deputy Speaker, I can see you but unfortunately cannot see the Minister. I apologise in advance for the fact that my myopia means that I will be slightly less coherent than usual.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.2/2">This Bill is a fantastic boost to all British business. In a constituency such as Skipton and Ripon, it is a particularly good shot in the arm for an area of Britain where employment is on the up and unemployment is</p>
	<p pid="b.63.2/3">going down. In my constituency, unemployment is down by about 30% and youth unemployment is down by about 35%, and more new businesses are being created. This is a big opportunity to give those entrepreneurs the backing they require to take on more jobs. The businesses in my constituency are largely based around tourism, agriculture, farming and small manufacturing. Many of the businesses in the 900 square miles that I represent are working under tough conditions, isolated and very vulnerable to the weather, and every bit of help they can get is a major boost.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.2/4">We are very excited in the Yorkshire dales and in all parts of my constituency because in less than a year the Government-backed Tour de France will be on its way. I hope that the Minister may come and participate; I know that she is very into her sport. That event, which this Westminster-based, Conservative-led Government have backed, will be a major boost for Yorkshire&#8212;one of the most rural parts of our country. This policy will help businesses to try to make sure that they are taking advantage of this great sporting event.</p>
	<p pid="b.63.2/5">We have talked about how this policy contrasts with the policies of the Labour party. Most of my colleagues in the Chamber have set up and run businesses, and we probably all agree that at the start of the previous Government&#8217;s time in office the messages were quite good. There were things such as taper relief to encourage entrepreneurs and talk of deregulation tsars, and it all looked as though it was moving in the right direction, but it tailed off pretty quickly. As well as pledging at the last election to raise the jobs tax, which the Federation of Small Businesses said would cost about 57,000 jobs in the UK, they raised the 50p tax rate&#8212;one of the so-called elephant traps set by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> to try to trap the next Government. Six regulations were added to the statute book per week. There were regular, astronomical rises in fuel duty, which in a constituency such as Skipton and Ripon had a major impact on businesses and families. Somebody may correct me, but I understand that not one debate about exports took place in this House under the previous Labour Government.</p>

Any claim that Labour is the party of small business is a very hollow one.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/2">The reason for my excitement about this policy is that it is one of a very large number of policies to back the risk-taker and the entrepreneur&#8212;the person who is ready to spend all night worrying about the new employee and ready to risk their capital. A few weeks ago, I went</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/3">to Downing street with a number of right hon. and hon. Friends, and I met the most inspiring young people who were beneficiaries of the start-up loan scheme and the new enterprise allowance scheme. Downing street was packed with budding entrepreneurs who were benefiting from this Government&#8217;s policy. That policy is one of many, including taking out two regulations before one regulation is brought in; ensuring that 25% of all procurement goes to small businesses; taking away pre-qualification questionnaires; increasing the annual investment allowance from &#163;25,000 to &#163;250,000; cutting corporation tax; investing in apprenticeships; creating 27,000 business mentors; and introducing the regional growth fund and the local enterprise partnerships. There is an endless list of policies that this Government have put in place to back the entrepreneur.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/4">That is not to say that we are perfect. The Government have a very strong record, but I would pose them a few questions. We are doing so many good things that we often fail to communicate them in as coherent and focused a way as possible and in a way that is easiest for small businesses. I encourage the Minister, who is coming turbo-charged into her new job, to consider the role of HMRC. The Government communicate more through HMRC than any other arm of Government. How can we use it better to signpost, particularly to small businesses and micro-businesses, the good things that this Government are doing?</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/5">How can we cut bureaucracy? We have heard about the bureaucracy involved in the national insurance holiday. How can we make sure that any red tape involved in this new policy is reduced as much as possible?</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/6">I urge the Government and my party to start differentiating ourselves not just from the Labour party, but from our coalition partners, with a small business Bill to show that we need to do even more to take small businesses out of the regulation quagmire they find themselves in. I remember sitting through the debate on the Government&#8217;s employment changes&#8212;colleagues have already discussed them&#8212;which were very simple and straightforward. Employers will have two years before they have to decide whether they want to keep an employee. Settlement agreements will at least allow an employer to offer an employee a deal when things are not working out. There will also be tribunal charges, not for people who cannot afford it&#8212;before Opposition Members intervene&#8212;but for most employees, who will have to pay a fee before taking an employer to tribunal. All of those really good changes&#8212;every single one of them&#8212;were opposed by the Labour party. It is heartening that, despite Labour&#8217;s rhetoric, it looks as though its Members are going to back this Bill, not by voting in favour of it, but by not opposing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.64.1/7">I pay tribute to the Treasury, the Exchequer Secretary, who started this debate, the Chancellor and the Conservative Ministers at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, who are pushing ahead with enterprise reform. This Bill is a major step towards sealing the Conservative party&#8217;s record on backing those people in our society who want to take a risk and run a business.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.0/1">It is an honour and a privilege to follow the impassioned speech of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40534" name="Julian Smith">the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Julian Smith)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/2">I was fortunate enough to secure an Adjournment debate last week. The good news was that it was on the subject of supporting first-time employers, but the bad news was that I secured the 2.30 pm on a Friday afternoon slot, which is not always prime time in Parliament. I am therefore pleased to be able to return to the subject and debate it further in the presence of a few other colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/3">The good news is that over the past decade the number of people who work for themselves has increased to 4.2 million, or 14% of all those in employment&#8212;up from 12% at the start of the century. They are taking the chance to be their own boss and often embracing new technologies to enable that. Record numbers of people are working for themselves. As I have said, that is good news, but it would be even better if more of the self-employed, one-person businesses and sole traders took the step from being first-time entrepreneurs to being first-time employers. That is why I support the new employment allowance: it is a huge step forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/4">Entrepreneurialism is a culture that spreads. Once a person is in it, they live it. They go native, as they say, and embrace risk-taking. Significantly, entrepreneurs are more likely than established businesses to take on workers from the ranks of the unemployed or the non-active, who often find the formalised application processes, let alone the working practices, of large firms restrictive. Established companies may tend to value the ability to adhere to existing processes and systems above the creativity, dynamism and individual flair that smaller businesses help to stimulate. Doing more to encourage the smallest firms to take on staff, particularly a first member of staff, has to be a step in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/5">Despite siren warnings from the unions and others that self-employed jobs are not proper jobs, there is clear evidence that the self-employed and those employed by them in the smallest companies enjoy better industrial relations. Data from the most recent workplace employment relations survey suggest that 67% of employees in the small and medium-sized enterprise sector strongly agree that managers treat them fairly, compared with 53% of those who work in large firms.</p>
	<p pid="b.65.0/6">Furthermore, a survey by the TUC, no less, and YouGov has shown that a greater proportion of employees in small firms report the highest levels of job satisfaction, compared with employees in larger firms. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon has said, there is still a tendency in Whitehall to prefer to deal with larger companies and to underestimate the burdens on the smallest businesses when introducing uniform regulations. The new employment allowance, however, shows that this Government understand the importance of measures that, though uniform, are of greatest benefit to the smallest operators, and that is why they should be commended.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.0/1">I endorse my hon. Friend&#8217;s last point. It is clear that if the boss of a business works closely with his first employee, industrial relations should be excellent and there should be no problems. That is the reason for the 67% satisfaction rate.</p>

	<p pid="b.66.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. That is absolutely the case. This is about how we build good working relationships and a strong economic base through SMEs. That is far more sustainable than</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/2">the approach adopted by the previous Government, which seemed to be underpinned by more and more public spending. That is completely unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/3">What a boost it will be for more of the growing army of the self-employed to become small employers. Indeed, if they all, or a vast proportion of them, took on one employee, that would make a huge dent&#8212;even bigger than the current one&#8212;in the unemployment figures. The number of self-employed people with no employees has increased, but the number of self-employed people with a small number of employees has not kept pace, and that is what the Bill seeks to address. In the past, the focus has been more on encouraging people to start up a business and less on taking the next step to becoming micro-employers. The Bill is an opportunity to further liberate the self-employed from barriers to growth and to nudge first-time entrepreneurs into becoming first-time employers. The prize is stronger, more sustainable economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/4">Micro-businesses play an important role in Macclesfield, working in forums like Make it Macclesfield and the Poynton business forum. They make a huge contribution to strengthening the community and, at the same time, moving our economy forward by creating jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/5">Surveys and statistics abound to show that small businesses can be, and often are, job-creation machines. They also show that small businesses are more likely to employ the longer-term unemployed and those who may struggle to enter the job market as a result of a lack of formal qualifications or, indeed, their ethnic background. This is what the Federation of Small Businesses calls the &#8220;entrepreneurial pipeline&#8221; to what Professor Mark Hart calls &#8220;growth gazelles&#8221;. We need to encourage more growth gazelles. Essentially, this is about everyday entrepreneurs, street-level small businesses and office-share operators giving people a chance to work. Analysis by the FSB suggests that 74% of those who become self-employed and who have employees come from the self-employed who had no employee, and that a further 13% come from employees who had been working in micro-businesses. Clearly, there will be a multiplier effect once we get this right and start moving in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.66.1/6">The Government are absolutely right to introduce the new employment allowance. Slashing the cost of national insurance and taking many employees out of it completely will encourage more of the self-employed to become employers. However, this is not&#8212;and nor should it be&#8212;the only measure to increase the number of first-time employers. The Bill must be viewed in concert with the new enterprise allowance&#8212;for which Levi Roots is an ambassador for the Government&#8212;which seeks to encourage the longer-term unemployed into self-employment. The three-year moratorium on new regulations for small businesses is another important step in the right direction. I encourage Ministers at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to view it as a rolling moratorium.</p>

	<p pid="b.67.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving way in his excellent speech. Does he agree that one of the most depressing things about the lack of Labour Members present is that, to make those schemes truly work, we all need to push them, whatever our political viewpoint, in order to ensure that those who are taking the risks hear about them and understand them?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.68.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40381" speakername="David Rutley" colnum="68"  time="018:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#131104-0002.htm_spnew73">
	<p pid="b.68.0/1">Absolutely; there is a responsibility on all Members to do that. It is disappointing how few Opposition Members are present, and what they have said has been negative, rather than focused on the opportunities that are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/2">As Lord Young of Graffham has rightly argued, there are regulatory issues that we must deal with. The employment allowance will simplify the system for small businesses. We must also tackle the problems with culture and communication. Through careers advice in schools, we must help young people to realise that there are huge opportunities in small businesses. If people are familiar with SMEs and particularly micro-businesses early in their careers, they are more likely to stick with them and to take the step of setting up small businesses themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/3">There is certainly no lack of ambition. The Prince&#8217;s Trust has found that up to 30% of young people expect to be self-employed, and a YouGov poll has found that 43% of young people have made money through entrepreneurial activities, like selling their own products or working on a freelance basis. We must help them to achieve their ambitions. The Bill means that their aspirations will not just be pipe dreams. It is a can-do Bill for a can-do generation and it deserves our support.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/4">Those who seek to regulate businesses or to complicate the tax system should recognise the consequences of doing so. Whitehall communications must take notice of business-to-business communications so that those communications can be strengthened. My hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon highlighted the importance of the work of HMRC on communicating more effectively. I would add to that the work of Directgov.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/5">As Lord Young says, it is vital that the psychological barriers are broken down so that they do not stifle the ambition that is latent in the marketplace. If we are to create an aspiration nation, the road to running one&#8217;s own business must be a clearly signposted fast lane, not the last Labour Government&#8217;s minefield of forms, box ticking and regulations. Their approach reminded me of a sign that I saw once to a business park, which said, &#8220;Enterprise Way&#8212;Cul-de-sac&#8221;. We have to have a different perspective and that is what this Government are seeking to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/6">In small firms, there is often less formality, more fluidity and greater flexibility. What we need, and what we now have, is a simple tax allowance that everybody can understand. That will create more jobs and more first-time employers. It is vital that the Government communicate the scheme creatively. I also say to the Minister that we must not listen to what is said by the Opposition. The idea that we have listened to them in designing the scheme is fanciful. After the deficit and flawed forecasts that they gave us, the chances of our listening to them are somewhere between no hope and Bob Hope. Their jobs tax, on top of the record deficit, would have been devastating for the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.0/7">In conclusion, I am delighted that the Government are champions of first-time entrepreneurs. I believe that the Bill will help us to encourage more of them to become first-time employers. I give the Bill my full support.</p>

	<p pid="b.68.1/1">I will say a few words in support of the Bill. Like all Government Members, I believe that this is an excellent measure that</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/2">recognises that it is businesses of all sizes that create jobs in this country. People are now finding jobs in growing numbers. By reducing taxes on employment, we will make it more likely that businesses will employ more people. The strength of the recovery in the private sector underlines the growth in the economy as a whole. The Labour party predicted that growth would not come and that jobs would not be created. By reducing the cost of national insurance to employers, the Government are in this Bill taking another excellent step in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.68.1/3">I agree with the Exchequer Secretary that we should look at the Bill as one of a range of important measures that the Government are introducing to support the business community, and all those measures support each other. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40534" name="Julian Smith">the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Julian Smith)</phrase> spoke of meeting young people under the age of 30 who had received StartUp loans from the Government to invest in starting their own businesses, which have had a great deal of success. The Bill will help businesses like those to get to the next stage on the path to growth and to go from being a start-up to employing a small number of people. There is an enormous appetite among people in this country to have a go at starting their own business. That is one of the most positive things to come out of the recession. We need policies that work with the grain of people&#8217;s entrepreneurial instincts and back them as they back themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.69.0/1">I have listened carefully to this debate. I have never run a small business; I have run a medium-sized business, but it was not my own. Would it not be a tremendous fillip to small businesses if HMRC was slightly more proactive when it saw a business making a clear mistake, and wrote to it saying, &#8220;It would be better if you did it this way&#8221;?</p>

	<p pid="b.69.1/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. The quality of the advice to businesses from all quarters is important. That echoes a point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon, who said that we all need to advocate the Government&#8217;s policies to ensure that businesses benefit from them.</p>

	<p pid="b.69.2/1">I pay tribute to the work that my hon. Friend has done within our party for a number of years to encourage entrepreneurs. It has been a most successful scheme. May I ask him for his reflections on that scheme? We have talked about the StartUp loans scheme and the new enterprise allowance, but he probably has the most experience of any Conservative Member of the competitive encouragement of small businesses.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.69.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40262" speakername="Damian Collins" colnum="69"  time="018:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#131104-0002.htm_spnew78">
	<p pid="b.69.3/1">It is very kind of my hon. Friend to make those remarks. The start-up hub competition at the Conservative party conference has given small businesses an opportunity. That has been a good way to ensure that those businesses are plugged into the decision makers and people with influence in their local communities, and to ensure that they are benefiting from the breadth of schemes that the Government have to offer. We have run the competition for three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/2">At this year&#8217;s party conference, I was pleased to meet Neill Ricketts of Versarien, which employs groundbreaking technology to improve the cooling systems that are used</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/3">in the mainframes of computers and data storage systems. That business, which started within the lifetime of this Parliament, is going from strength to strength. It was floated on the alternative investment market this year, employs a large number of people and is growing fast.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/4">There is a business in my constituency that was started by a group of young men. The managing director is only just 30 years old. The business specialises in search engine optimisation and social marketing campaigns. It employs more than 20 people and is growing rapidly. It has developed a way of specialising its techniques for small local businesses so that it can design social media and search engine optimisation campaigns to help businesses on the high street to grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/5">People are using their knowledge and expertise to develop innovative businesses and to demonstrate that there is a market for them that has not been realised. People are developing cutting-edge technologies and products that will be exportable and that will help businesses to develop and grow.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/6">One business that succeeded through the start-up hub competition was started by Julian Hakes, who redesigned the high-heeled shoe. He is an architect and he applied the principles of architecture to a fashion item. This year, his product was given the accessory of the year award by <i>Vogue</i>. It went viral on the internet and he has export orders from around the world. That was all based on a good idea that he was able to take to market. Credit is also due to two good trade bodies, the British Fashion Council and the UK Fashion and Textile Association, which supported him in the development of his business.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/7">There are some brilliant people who are doing great things. We need to get behind them and support them. We have good schemes that can do that. My hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon made a good point about our advocating those schemes and ensuring that people are aware of them. At Tech City in east London, one hears people talking enthusiastically about the enterprise investment schemes that are available. When we meet politicians from Germany, as my hon. Friend has done, we find that they are interested in the way that we use enterprise investment schemes to encourage private investors to invest in start-up businesses. However, I wonder whether our own chambers of commerce and people around the country know enough about the schemes that are available and that they could benefit from. We all have an important role to play in advocating the Government schemes that are there to help people get their businesses to the next stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/8">That support sits alongside a strong regional growth policy that is being delivered through the regional growth fund. In east Kent in my constituency, the regional growth fund has granted a third of the money that has been awarded. Tens of millions of pounds are being spent and invested by businesses. People are being employed on the back of that investment.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/9">H. V. Wooding in Hythe, which was visited by the Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40524" name="Michael Fallon">the Member for Sevenoaks (Michael Fallon)</phrase>, is investing in a new plant and machinery to expand its production capabilities. It is a precision engineering company that makes parts for the Hadron Collider at CERN, and it makes busbars that are used across a wide range of industry and machine parts for Formula 1 engines. It is bidding for contracts that have</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/10">gone overseas in the past decade, to bring them back to this country because it can compete in that sector. It is benefiting from regional growth fund money, which is helping it take its business to the next level, and it is employing people now.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/11">One reason why unemployment is falling much faster than predicted is that the schemes to benefit smaller businesses are helping them grow and employ more people, and we are seeing the knock-on effect. It is not only bigger businesses that are doing well and competing, but smaller ones too. The challenge we should set ourselves is: &#8220;Do we have a strong and robust investment culture? Is this a country that people around the world want to invest in?&#8221; Increasingly, we are seeing that it is. People are investing in this country because of low levels of corporation tax compared with our competitors in Europe and America. That is why people are bringing investment from all over the world to this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/12">Not only are smaller businesses investing in themselves, but the investment community is investing in them through crowdsource funding and companies like Funding Circle. People can match fund some of the Government schemes to help businesses get the finance they need, and that is an important part of the growth of our economy. In the &#8217;80s, thanks to privatisation we were seen as a nation of shareholders. In the next decade, could we be a nation of shareholder and start-up businesses where people take advantage of available schemes to invest in start-up and smaller businesses in their areas? We should set ourselves that challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.69.3/13">Finally, we should not lose sight of the big projects that the Government must back, including those that will not benefit us directly in this Parliament but are important for the next 10 to 20 years&#8212;major infrastructure projects like high-speed rail or investment in electricity power generation. Such projects are vital for our future competitiveness. We have sometimes looked at other countries and seen how their infrastructure has helped them to compete. We have the tax and investment policies, ideas and people to compete, but we must ensure that we invest now in the big infrastructure projects we need to help those people grow in future. I commend those projects that I have touched on in my remarks, as well as the Bill which, as my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary said, is an important part of the range of measures that the Government have put in place to support entrepreneurship in this country.</p>

It is something we have been proposing for the past three years, so we greatly welcome its introduction through the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/2">We have had a wide-ranging debate. We have touched on the living wage, the economy, employment, unemployment self-employment&#8212;many forms of employment. We have strayed far from the core subject and, I think, strained the patience of the Deputy Speakers in the Chair today. At times, we have been on a magical history tour in which the history of this country and its economy has not only been airbrushed, but at times rewritten. In my concluding remarks, I hope to bring back a bit of realism to the discussion. I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40534" name="Julian Smith">the hon. Member for Skipton and Ripon (Julian Smith)</phrase> finds that somewhat depressing, but I am going to do it anyway.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/3">I am disappointed that the Exchequer Secretary is not in his place for the winding-up speeches, as it is important to take a little step back in time and recall how the Bill was introduced. Until recently he was my opposite number, and it would have been good to have him in his usual place. The hon. Gentleman has the dubious privilege of being one of an ever-diminishing number of junior coalition Ministers who have been in the same job since 2010. He therefore finds himself in an unfortunate position because we can measure the ambitions that he set out for supporting small businesses and job creation against his actual record of delivery in government.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/4">As we have heard, although this was not included in the draft Bill published on <phrase class="date" code="2013-07-16">16 July</phrase>, the main purpose of the National Insurance Contributions Bill is to implement the employment allowance announced by the Chancellor in the Budget 2013. Given the apparent importance of the policy&#8212;which accounts for clauses 1 to 8 of this short Bill&#8212;perhaps when she concludes the Minister will say why the employment allowance was not mentioned in the draft legislation. It would be useful to clarify that.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.0/5">As my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood made clear in her excellent opening speech, the Opposition support the introduction of this measure and this Bill. It might be painful for the Exchequer Secretary&#8212;although he is not here to pained&#8212;but it could be helpful to cast our minds back to why we support this Bill. Let us think back to 2011 and the similarly entitled National Insurance Contributions Bill of that year.</p>

	<p pid="b.72.1/1">Before the hon. Lady casts our minds back to 2011, may I ask her the question I asked her hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" name="Shabana Mahmood">the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase>? In 2010 she stood on a manifesto that planned to increase the jobs tax. People want politicians who are honest, so will the hon. Lady say that that was a mistake?</p>

	<p pid="b.72.2/1">I will repeat the words of my hon. Friend, who said that she was proud to stand in 2010 on a manifesto for a Labour Government who were committed to reducing the deficit but had an economy that was growing. Since then we have seen three years of stagnating growth, wages rising slower than prices, and borrowing not coming down anywhere</p>
	<p pid="b.72.2/2">near the amount the Government promised. I would caution Government Members against trying to rewrite in this Chamber the history of what they have achieved over the past three years.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.2/3">On that point, let us return to 2011. The Bill taken through this House by the Exchequer Secretary&#8212;I welcome him back to his seat&#8212;included the introduction of the three-year national insurance holiday, worth &#163;5,000 for employers. The scheme, which was originally announced at the Chancellor&#8217;s first Budget in June 2010, was not aimed at supporting just any employers, however, because it was restricted. It did not apply to businesses in London and the south-east or east of England, as we mentioned earlier, and it extended only to new business start-ups, and then only to the first 10 employees of those firms&#8212;but, of course, only to those first 10 employees who had been hired in the first year of that business. I hope hon. Members are still with me. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I am sure the Minister is still with me as he designed the dubious policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.72.2/4">Indeed, serious concerns about the scheme&#8217;s complexity were raised at the time by Robert Chote&#8212;then at the Institute for Fiscal Studies; now at the Office for Budget Responsibility&#8212;who told the Treasury Committee that the policy</p>
	<p pid="b.72.2/5">&#8220;might be a little too complicated to offer best value for money.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.73.0/1">Was the context at the time that the Labour party had left the nation&#8217;s finances in the most appalling mess, and that for any incoming Government not to target a policy carefully would have been crazy? According to the Government auditor, three Government Departments had lost complete control of their finances.</p>

	<p pid="b.73.1/1">Once again, Government Members want to airbrush the past three years of stagnation, lack of economic growth and the failure of the Government&#8217;s implementation of that policy. They failed to address the issue quickly enough, so only today are we finally introducing a policy that will help and that will give that support to small businesses. Unfortunately, it is a little too late in the day for some businesses, which have suffered over the last three years, and for the people who have lost their jobs as a result.</p>

	<p pid="b.73.3/1">Coalition Back Benchers want to forget what the Government have done and the past three years of the policy we are debating. They want to debate a policy that never came into play.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.3/2">None the less, despite the restrictive and complex nature of the previous scheme, the Exchequer Secretary and his Treasury colleagues had bold ambitions for it. He acknowledged from the Dispatch Box that some 400,000 new businesses would benefit from the scheme, with each successful applicant creating an average of two jobs. At that rate, the scheme would have created 800,000 new jobs, with a total cost to the Exchequer of &#163;940 million over its three-year lifespan.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.3/3">Given that the scheme, which was one of the Chancellor&#8217;s flagship policies, drew to a close in September, one might have assumed that the Exchequer Secretary would</p>
	<p pid="b.73.3/4">want to promote the outcome. Sadly, he cannot do so&#8212;sadly for the businesses that failed to benefit. Only through a written answer obtained by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase>, the shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, did we learn that a grand total of some 25,400 businesses successfully applied for the scheme over the three-year period. That is undeniably a sizeable number, and the creation of any new jobs in the past three years, during a period of economic stagnation, is welcome; but with only 6% of the target reached, the Exchequer Secretary has had to acknowledge that, as flagship policies for economic growth go, that one has been a bit of a flop.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.3/5">When the previous scheme was introduced, the Opposition called for there to be no regional restrictions on it, for it to be extended to charities, and for a review of its effectiveness after six months. Those proposals were rejected. The Government ploughed on with a scheme that obviously was not delivering the goods throughout its operation. That was why, as long ago as September 2011, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" name="Edward Balls">the Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls)</phrase>, the shadow Chancellor, called for a one-year national insurance break for every small firm that took on extra workers, using the money left over from that failing Government policy&#8212;it was clear that it was failing even in September 2011.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.3/6">The Government are now introducing the employment allowance. It is not regionally restricted and will apply to charities as well as businesses, and it will apply whether or not they are start-ups. It should be easier for firms to access it because it will be delivered by the standard payroll software and Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs real time information system, as the Exchequer Secretary said in his opening comments. The question is this: why did it take so long? Given that the scheme will not be available until April 2014, we have had nearly four wasted years when the Chancellor could have helped the thousands of small businesses about which Government Members have spoken so passionately to expand and create jobs.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.0/1">This might be a foreign notion to Labour Members, but one reason why it has taken three years to propose the Bill is that the Government have waited until the country can afford it and put the finances right in the meantime.</p>

	<p pid="b.74.3/1">The Opposition support the legislation and it will pass unopposed this evening. It is rightly up to the Government to promote their support for small businesses. As Government Members have</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/2">said, HMRC should take a proactive role in ensuring that businesses are aware of schemes that are available to support them.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/3">Clauses 11 to 20 relate to the certification scheme for oil and gas workers on the continental shelf, limited liability partnerships and several miscellaneous measures, but I want to focus briefly on clauses 9 and 10, which seek to extend the application of the general anti-abuse rule to national insurance contributions. The GAAR, which came into force on Royal Assent of the Finance Act 2013, incorporates income tax, corporation tax, capital gains tax, inheritance tax, petroleum revenue tax, stamp duty, land tax and the new annual tax on enveloped dwellings.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/4">A number of Opposition Members raised the concern that the GAAR is intended to prevent only &#8220;highly contrived tax avoidance&#8221; that has &#8220;abnormal features&#8221;. The man who designed the GAAR, Graham Aaronson QC, believes that it is</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/5">&#8220;clearly intended to apply only to egregious, or very aggressive, tax avoidance schemes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/6">What deterrent effect is such a narrowly drafted GAAR expected to have? As the Government&#8217;s flagship policy for tackling tax avoidance, what dent will the GAAR make on the tax gap, which HMRC says is &#163;32.2 billion a year?</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/7">During the debate on the 2013 Act, I pointed out that the GAAR is expected to yield &#163;60 million in 2014-15, rising to &#163;85 million by 2017-18. I am more than willing to acknowledge that those are sizeable sums, but the point made in the House back in April was that it represented a drop in the ocean compared with the then tax gap of &#163;32.2 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/8">What has changed since? HMRC&#8217;s latest tax gap estimate, of the difference between what is collected and what would be collected if everyone complied with the letter and spirit of the law, concluded that it has increased to &#163;35 billion, a staggering 8.7% increase in the space of 12 months. I accept that many dispute the figure and say it is too low&#8212;that it does not include much of what could be incorporated in the figure for tax avoided.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/9">The latest HMRC estimate, which covers 2011-12, indicates that some &#163;15.3 billion of the gap can be accounted for by unpaid income tax, capital gains tax and NICs combined. HMRC suggests that approximately &#163;4 billion of the gap arises out of avoidance &#8220;behaviour&#8221;. Will the Minister therefore clarify exactly how much of the &#163;35 billion tax gap is thought to be made up of NICs that are unpaid through avoidance? Given that the Bill deals with only the most aggressive or egregious avoidance activity, how much will extending the GAAR to NICs yield for the Exchequer in additional revenue?</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/10">The Opposition have raised many other concerns about the GAAR&#8212;my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood mentioned the Swiss deal and the number of holes in that arrangement, which leave a hole in the Government&#8217;s estimates. However, there is also the highly subjective double reasonableness test, which can be used to determine whether a means of avoiding a tax can</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/11">&#8220;reasonably be regarded as a reasonable course of action&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/12">That subjectivity is helpfully explained in the GAAR guidance, which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/13">&#8220;The words &#8216;contrived&#8217; and &#8216;abnormal&#8217; are not defined, and therefore will be applied in their normal sense&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/14">We have long argued that that is a fig leaf, or could be used as a fig leaf, for tacitly legitimising tax avoidance that does not fall within those definitions. We tabled amendments to ensure that the GAAR would be reviewed, and to assess its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/15">Most critically, we have questioned the independence of the advisory panel established by the Treasury to oversee the GAAR. At the time, I said:</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/16">&#8220;What a tax expert considers to be reasonable might be regarded differently in the eyes of a member of the public. Indeed, many tax experts will differ on what they believe to be reasonable tax planning, as opposed to something egregious that would fall under the GAAR.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2013-04-17.425"><i>Official Report</i>, 17 April 2013; Vol. 561, c. 425-426</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/17">What has changed since April? A matter of weeks after being hand-picked to deliberate on the Government&#8217;s flagship anti-avoidance policy, one panel member was caught on camera at a tax planning conference offering tips to people on how to keep their money</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/18">&#8220;out of the Chancellor&#8217;s grubby mitts&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/19">HMRC&#8217;s website simply tells us:</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/20">&#8220;David Heaton resigned from the Advisory Panel on <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-13">13 September 2013</phrase>. Arrangements are being put in place to appoint a successor.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/21">It would be helpful to hear from the Minister exactly what those arrangements are, when she expects the appointment to be made and, most importantly, how she and her ministerial colleagues will ensure that this never happens again. If the GAAR is to retain or, indeed, regain any shred of credibility, what are the Government going to do about that?</p>
	<p pid="b.74.3/22">As we have said, we back the Bill, especially the main provision&#8212;the employment allowance. We repeatedly called for changes to the previous national insurance holiday scheme and we consistently warned that it would be a flop. Many of the changes we called for will be introduced in the employment allowance, but it is disappointing that for hundreds of thousands of small businesses it has taken almost four years to deliver the policy that they need. They deserve better, but the Bill is a small step in the right direction today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.76.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40376" speakername="Nicky Morgan" speakeroffice="The Economic Secretary to the Treasury"  colnum="76"  time="018:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#131104-0002.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.76.0/1">This has been a wide-ranging debate and I am grateful to have heard all the thoughtful contributions that have been made. It is noticeable that we heard seven contributions from this side, but only one from Opposition Back Benchers&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I welcome the Opposition&#8217;s support for the Bill, but as the shadow Minister said, the Bill is wide ranging, and Opposition Members could have talked about businesses, employment and the living wage. They have not taken the opportunity to do so and clearly had nothing to say about the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/2">Before I respond to the points raised by hon. Members, it is worth reiterating the four key points of the Bill. First, from next April, all businesses, charities and community amateur sports clubs will benefit. They will receive a &#163;2,000 employment allowance every year to set against their employer national insurance contributions liability. This is a measure specifically set out to support jobs. If I run a small firm employing four members of staff on the average private sector wage, I would see my national insurance contributions bill cut by more than a fifth. If I start a brand-new business and want to give</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/3">up to 10 18 to 20-year-olds their first chance of full-time employment, paying the minimum wage, I would pay no national insurance contributions at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/4">We have previously had time-limited allowances targeted at some businesses, but this is a universal allowance that will help all businesses. It is easy to understand and administer and, most importantly, it will make it easier for businesses in all our constituencies to create jobs. I am sure that that is something that all hon. Members want to see.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/5">Secondly, as well as making it easier for employers to take on staff, the Bill will make it harder for companies to avoid taxes. It will give effect to the general anti-abuse rule, or GAAR, for NICs. As such, it is indicative of the Government&#8217;s intention to take a robust line in tackling all forms of tax avoidance. Thirdly, it will allow the Treasury to make regulations to bring in a certification scheme for the oil and gas industry when someone other than the deemed employer for national insurance is undertaking those duties on their behalf. This is part of the Government&#8217;s wider measure to address schemes involving employers setting up outside the UK and providing workers to the UK in order to avoid paying employment taxes.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/6">Finally, the Bill will make changes to tackle disguised employment and to address the tax issue arising from the UK implementation of the alternative investment fund managers directive, which the Exchequer Secretary described in some detail earlier. The importance of those last three measures should not be underestimated. With the associated tax changes they will contribute towards raising &#163;265 million for the Exchequer in the 2014-15 tax year.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/7">As I have said, we heard some excellent contributions to the debate. I am sorry to say that the Labour contributions did not extend to any great insight into the Labour party policy on support for businesses. First, Opposition Members tried to take credit for this Bill, if hon. Members can imagine such a thing. The shadow Chief Secretary said that we should say sorry. If sorry is the hardest word, we have never heard it from the Labour party, which left us&#8212;as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40381" name="David Rutley">the Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley)</phrase> said&#8212;with the legacy of a huge deficit and enormous debt that we are having to pay off. This Government are having to make the tough choices.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40084" name="Shabana Mahmood">The hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood)</phrase> was wrong about the Labour party&#8217;s national insurance contributions scheme, because it would have applied only to small businesses. Our scheme will apply to all businesses. She also said that administration of the previous scheme cost &#163;12 million. In fact, the estimated administration costs from the start of the national insurance contributions scheme that finished in September were &#163;770,000&#8212;nowhere near millions of pounds. There was tight control on its administration.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/9">We will not take a history lesson from the Opposition about the regional national insurance contributions holiday. My hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary made it clear at the start of the debate that this was a temporary, targeted measure that helped 26,000 businesses and created 90,000 jobs. That is 90,000 people who have employment as a result of that scheme. That is something that we should be proud of, while recognising that there is scope for a new scheme, and that is what the Bill will introduce.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/10">On the GAAR, the Opposition had 13 years to introduce it, but they failed to do so. They can pick holes in the scheme as much as they want, but the point is that this Government have taken the tough decisions. The rule will act as a deterrent to those tempted to engage in abusive avoidance schemes. It will take time to bed in, and we will keep it under review.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/11">In answer to the specific questions asked by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase>, the GAAR is expected to raise some &#163;235 million over the next five years and it will also protect revenue that would otherwise be lost. We are confident that the GAAR will change the avoidance landscape as its impact starts to be recognised. The hon. Lady also asked about the Bill not being published in draft, but she then said that we had taken a long time to get round to making the Bill happen. She cannot have it both ways, although that is a position the Labour party always likes to be in.</p>
	<p pid="b.76.0/12">The employment allowance will be introduced from <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-06">6 April</phrase> next year. If we had had time for formal consultation, it would have delayed the implementation date, which is something that none of us wants to see. However, I can tell the hon. Lady that HMRC has held discussions with various stakeholders over the summer on the detailed implementation of the employment allowance, and those discussions have helped to inform the design of the new system.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.0/1">I thank the Minister for responding to some of the questions that I raised. She seems to be moving away from the subject of the GAAR, but I wonder if she could address the questions relating to the advisory panel and the member who was dismissed from it in disgrace. What will the Government do to ensure that that does not happen again and that the credibility of the GAAR advisory panel, which was dented by those events, is restored?</p>

	<p pid="b.78.1/1">Perhaps I should repeat my comments. This Government should get enormous credit for introducing a GAAR in the first place. The last Government had 13 years to introduce one and failed to do so. The important point about the panel is that it is independent. It was recommended by Graham Aaronson, and its members are independent from the Government. The gentleman in question has resigned. It is an important safeguard in the operation of the system that the panel&#8217;s independence is maintained.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/2">I turn now to the excellent contributions from Back Benchers, especially on this side of the House. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40585" name="Margot James">the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James)</phrase> talked about charities benefiting from the Bill. It is very welcome that they will benefit as they employ 800,000 people. She also talked about the huge step of taking on the responsibility for that first employee. She is absolutely right about that and I am sure that all hon. Members will wish the very best to the lady who is opening the new floristry business in my hon. Friend&#8217;s constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40494" name="Ian Swales">the Member for Redcar (Ian Swales)</phrase> was right to say the Bill offers real help to small businesses, and that taking on the first employee and worrying about how to pay their national insurance puts firms off growing. This is an important measure to support the next step on the employment journey.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" name="Sheila Gilmore">The hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore)</phrase> found it strange that we were looking at the Labour party&#8217;s national insurance policy. First, her party wants to be the next Government, so it should not be a surprise that we scrutinise its policies. Secondly, we are still having to deal with the legacy of the previous Government. All the tough decisions we take are framed by having to deal with that legacy. I should, however, congratulate her on being the only Labour Back Bencher to speak in the debate. She asked whether the employment allowance would create jobs. The Federation of Small Businesses expects 29% of small businesses to use it to boost staff wages, 28% to use it to employ additional staff and 24% to use it to invest in resources&#8212;it is welcomed by business organisations. It is estimated that 90% of businesses that employ people will take up the employment allowance. I am sure the hon. Lady will welcome businesses in her constituency taking up the employment allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.1/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> asked whether tax credits had been factored into the system. We do not believe that tax credits have been factored into this calculation, but the Office for Budget Responsibility considers the net impact of all Government policies on the economy. This policy has been subject to that scrutiny and I am sure we can discuss any further questions he has. He made a thoughtful contribution on the price of labour and the affordability of the living wage. I am sure that that is something we want to consider further. He is right to say that the employment allowance is a small but important start along the road of getting more people into employment. He was right about the encouragement of welfare dependency by the previous Government. By 2010, nine out of 10 families with children were reliant on the state. We want to make work pay. For example, our policy of raising the income tax threshold is all about ensuring that work pays and that people keep more of their earnings so they can spend them in a way that is right for them and their families.</p>

	<p pid="b.79.0/1">Will the Minister reflect on the fact that many households are worse off as a result of the Government&#8217;s policies on tax and tax credits? Many families are not seeing any benefit&#8212;quite the reverse.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.79.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40376" speakername="Nicky Morgan" colnum="79"  time="018:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#131104-0002.htm_spnew95">
	<p pid="b.79.1/1">Of course the Government recognise that living standards are under pressure and that household budgets are being squeezed, but it is interesting that the Labour party&#8217;s calculations on household income and wages and earnings never factor in tax cuts. We are factoring in tax cuts and ensuring that people keep more of their own money.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40281" name="Caroline Dinenage">the Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage)</phrase> made a characteristically excellent speech. She talked about the support the Bill will give by extending the employment allowance to small businesses and charities, and mentioned that she had been a small business owner herself. It is noticeable that many Government Members have run their own businesses. She rightly said that we want to make Britain business-friendly.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40534" name="Julian Smith">the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Julian Smith)</phrase>, who also ran his own business before entering this House, did a sterling job in delivering his</p>
	<p pid="b.79.1/4">speech despite having lost a contact lens&#8212;none of us noticed. He made an important point about communicating with small businesses via Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs, something I am sure Ministers will bear in mind. He also talked about making the employment allowance simple to administer. As my hon. Friend the Exchequer Secretary said in his opening remarks, the employment allowance will be delivered through employers&#8217; standard payroll software and HMRC&#8217;s real-time information system. There will be no need for a separate application form or an annual return to report deductions. There will, I hope, be no extra forms, which is good news for small businesses.</p>

	<p pid="b.80.0/1">I warmly welcome that simplicity. Does the Minister regret, as I do, the previous Government&#8217;s practice of announcing measures that were so complicated that they then asked the Treasury to calculate the savings that would accrue from non-take-up?</p>

	<p pid="b.80.1/1">My hon. Friend&#8217;s intervention says it all. Government Members have run small businesses and know that we need to keep paperwork, in all its forms, as simple as possible. People who run businesses do not want to spend their evenings and weekends filling in forms. They want to spend that time growing their businesses and taking on their next employee.</p>

	<p pid="b.80.2/1">The Minister is making a powerful argument, but it leads to the question: why did the Government introduce a national insurance holiday scheme in 2011 that was so complicated they could reach only 6% of the businesses it was targeted at?</p>

	<p pid="b.80.3/1">We heard earlier on that that was a time for a temporary target. We were dealing with the deficit and coping with the legacy left to us by the previous Government. We now have the opportunity to introduce a wider employment allowance. The hon. Lady should not try to teach us lessons about schemes, given the complexity of their scheme, which thankfully, they did not have the opportunity to introduce. How can the fact that 26,000 businesses have benefited and 90,000 jobs have been created be a failure?</p>

	<p pid="b.80.4/1">Does my hon. Friend find it as amazing as I do that Opposition Members can only snipe at schemes that are clearly designed to appeal to existing small businesses and will incentivise the starting up of new small businesses, which is what our economy desperately needs?</p>

	<p pid="b.80.5/1">My hon. Friend is right: that is exactly what our economy needs. I have been at the Dispatch Box only a few times, but, sadly, I am not surprised to see the Opposition sniping.

At the expiry of half an hour, no further petitions may be presented orally, but they may be placed in the petition bag and will be recorded as formally presented.

	<p pid="b.83.7/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I also thank Mr Speaker for allowing so many of us to present our petitions this evening. In fact, 119 petitions have been returned from constituencies around the country. Usually, at the close of business, the House empties, but instead, this evening, it has filled up with colleagues who have come to send a strong call from the countryside, a cry from the heart of England. I am delighted to see that the Secretary of State and the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40286" name="Brandon Lewis">the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis)</phrase>, are present to hear from us tonight.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/2">Contrary to the myth, rural residents earn less on average than people in cities and pay council tax that is &#163;76 a head higher, yet they see urban areas receive 50% more per head, despite the obvious higher cost of delivering many services in a rural area. We are calling on the Government to make a change; all we ask for is a rural fair share.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/3">The petition states:</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/4">The Petition of the residents of Beverley and Holderness,</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/5">Declares that the Petitioners believe that the Local Government Finance Settlement is unfair to rural communities; notes that the Rural Penalty sees urban areas receive 50% more support per</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/6">head than rural areas despite higher costs in rural service delivery; and opposes the planned freezing of this inequity in the 2013&#8211;14 settlement for six years until 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.7/7">The Petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urges the Government to reduce the Rural Penalty in staged steps by at least 10% by 2020.</p>

They believe that the local government finance settlement is unfair to rural communities, and note that the rural penalty sees urban areas receive 50% more support per head than rural areas, despite higher costs in rural service delivery. May it please the House to note that the Select Committee that I have the honour to chair has recently produced a report on this same issue, and that we have received a very disappointing Government response. I hope that we can link our report to these fair share petitions.</p>

	<p pid="b.88.2/1">As it is the first time I have had the pleasure of speaking in the House since your election to the Chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, may I congratulate you and say how pleased I am to be speaking this evening under your guidance?</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/2">The doctors and consultants in Brent, like those in the rest of the country, are highly respected members of our community. Their work is part of the glue that keeps our society together and enables people to function and get on with their daily lives. Doctors, though, would be the first to admit that they are not omniscient&#8212;well, some of them would. Their work depends upon the work of many others in the health care sector&#8212;in particular, the work of laboratory and radiography technicians who provide the evidential base for diagnosis and treatment. The quality of patient outcomes will always depend on the quality of diagnostic services because a diagnosis delayed is a treatment delayed, and an incorrect diagnosis is potentially fatal.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/3">This evening, I wish to detain the House and suggest to the Minister that the structural changes that his Government have introduced in the national health service have had a seriously adverse and dangerous impact on patient care.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/4">In May 2012, the decision was made to outsource pathology services in Brent and Harrow. Previously, it had been provided by the NHS at a facility at Northwick Park hospital. The decision was taken because the hospital wanted to invest in improvements to the system. Rather than incur those financial costs, it was considered more efficient to outsource the contract to TDL Ltd&#8212;otherwise known as The Doctors Laboratory. That was a mistake.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/5">The first indication that there was a problem came when a GP identified a serious technical flaw in the way patient test results were presented through the computerised system. The GP had received a list of multiple test results in respect of a patient. When looking at one set of results on the list and closing it or archiving it to the patient file, the GP realised that it was possible inadvertently to apply that same action to all the other test results returned on that list. Pathology results that required urgent action could be accidentally archived owing to an error in the TDL reporting system. Critical patient test results could be missed altogether or inappropriately actioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/6">The GP reported that as a serious incident and immediately flagged up the issue to the North West London Hospitals NHS Trust, on the assumption that pathology services were still being carried out there. In fact, the service has been provided by TDL since May 2012. The hospital trust passed the concerns on to the Brent and Harrow clinical commissioning group, which was now responsible for managing the contract with TDL. At that time, the matter was not thoroughly investigated and was deemed to be a single incident and not a cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/7">However, GPs began to talk to each other about their concerns and realised very quickly that they were not alone in seeing a sudden change in the quality of results</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/8">they were receiving from the service that had, up until 2012, been carried out adequately at Northwick Park hospital. At an emergency meeting with representatives of NHS Brent and Brent CCG, the GPs were led to believe that steps were being taken to resolve the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/9">The problem got worse. GPs across the borough were receiving many more abnormal results than they would ordinarily expect: test requests were ignored or the results were never reported back to them; other tests were being returned incomplete with only partial results and data omitted; and some samples were being incorrectly marked as complete and being discarded without being tested.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/10">This alarming downward trend in the quality of the results finally prompted NHS Brent and NHS Harrow to launch a proper investigation, which commenced on <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-20">20 December 2012</phrase>. Let me quote this root cause analysis investigation report, which finally reported in March of this year and found</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/11">&#8220;spurious results, missing results and samples not processed...reference ranges had changed and...the presentation of the results into groupings that did not make sense&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/12">One GP wrote to me to say:</p>
	<p pid="b.88.2/13">&#8220;In the new year the scale of serious anomalies and problems had become so great that individual practices started to send out e-mails to each other to see if the problems were as isolated as we were being led to believe&#8230;The response was shocking. Our patients are at serious risk. Unless we have these basic services reliably we cannot diagnose and treat our patients.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.89.0/1">The situation in north London is clearly shocking. Does my hon. Friend know whether any of the tests that were outsourced relate specifically to diabetes, which is a huge problem for people who live in Brent? About 10% of the population is thought to suffer from diabetes.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-04b.89.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40114" speakername="Barry Gardiner" colnum="89"  time="019:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0003.htm#131104-0003.htm_spnew30">
	<p pid="b.89.1/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his intervention, and he is absolutely right that diabetes is a major problem in the Brent area. Given that many of the tests related to phlebotomy, I would assume that some of them might have related to diabetes, but I do not have that specific information to hand.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/2">I was explaining that GPs across the borough were receiving many more abnormal results than they would ordinarily expect, that the downward trend in the quality of the results had prompted an investigation and that the GPs had expressed their own concerns by exchanging information among themselves to ascertain the extent of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/3">The interim deputy director of quality and safety for Brent, Ealing, Harrow and Hillingdon CCGs reported</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/4">&#8220;many incidents of patients attending for repeat blood tests at both the practice and within the hospital and some patients&#8230;referred to A&amp;E Department because of high potassium levels.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/5">Many consultants began to experience similar problems with the service and were also having to carry out further unnecessary tests. One consultant, when pressed, scribbled a note setting out a variety of issues:</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/6">&#8220;Immunology&#8212;assay results; Calcium results&#8212;change in calculations; Change in reference ranges; Potassium&#8212;delays in transfer and refrigeration&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/7">I am sure the Minister will agree that such failings in service are wholly unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/8">The question then arises how any competent company of qualified health professionals could come to make such errors. After all, its website states that it is</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/9">&#8220;providing quality accredited pathology services to the UK and worldwide&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/10">I trust the Minister will be as surprised and as disappointed as I was to learn that, at the time the service was outsourced, TDL was</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/11">&#8220;not currently registered with Clinical Pathology Accreditation (UK) but is working towards this&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/12">The words &#8220;working towards this&#8221; should be accompanied by some degree of scepticism, given that the final report on the root causes of the problem identified that TDL was so incompetent that</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/13">&#8220;There was an operational issue with the new robotic sorter which resulted in a number of samples being filed incorrectly as &#8216;analysis complete&#8217; and subsequently discarded. There was also a problem with one of the lines in the calcium analyser as a result of which samples were transferred to another laboratory, and a number of issues were attributed to human error.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/14">Compounding the confusion, when the service was transferred, TDL used different reference value ranges to assess and analyse results in order to fit in with its own IT systems. Unfortunately, it failed to communicate this change to the GPs or consultants who were now expected to interpret results that they did not understand, based on reference ranges with which they were not familiar. TDL was found to have not followed its own procedures, which required it to flag up to its service users when systems were changing. Owing to this transition, GPs and consultants were effectively left blind about the difficulties they might experience with pathology reports.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/15">Of course, the quality of any test results will always depend on the quality of the samples received. Just as in the world of computing, &#8220;garbage in leads to garbage out&#8221;. One would imagine that when the decision was taken to outsource the pathology courier service that delivers samples to the pathology laboratory, clear and appropriate clinical advice was sought about precisely how this contract should be specified&#8212;and it was. In fact, GPs suggested that a courier service carrying samples for potassium tests must be refrigerated in order to avoid the impact of temperature change on the quality of the sample. However, the terms of the contract failed to specify that, and the eventual service that was commissioned did not provide for temperature control.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/16">I have also received complaints about delays in delivery, as well as allegations that damage to samples in transit has made it difficult to record and analyse them properly. Indeed, the NHS Brent CCG noted in a report to the Brent health overview and scrutiny committee that issues of transportation quality and service delays on the part of the courier service, Revisecatch Ltd &#8212;trading as Courier Systems&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/17">&#8220;appear to play a seasonal role in the variation of potassium levels; in that they add to the instability of the samples due to fluctuation in temperature during storage at the GP practice and/or during transportation to the laboratory in both summer and winter&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/18">Another privatised diagnostic service, the London NHS Diagnostic Service, is provided by InHealth. It is designed to enable London GPs to make direct referrals for their patients so that they have already had tests before being referred to specialist consultants. The tests might include ultrasound, echocardiography, audiology, cardiac physiology, magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray,</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/19">endoscopy or phlebotomy scans. The intention was to reduce the CCG&#8217;s consultant costs by referring only patients who really needed their attention. In other words, GPs would filter patients to avoid unnecessary and costly referrals.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/20">GPs have objected that that practice has simply introduced a middleman to the process, and that delaying a diagnosis from a specialist consultant may put patients in danger. I am told that the problem is compounded because the scans received from InHealth are often themselves delayed, and are frequently found to be of such poor quality that the patient must be referred to a specialist consultant in any event. My office has also been given anecdotal evidence that staff at diagnostic centres do not possess the necessary skills or understanding to handle complex diagnostic services.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/21">General practitioners are not specialists. They are not consultants, and they are seeing scans which they cannot decipher or which are in a format that they cannot use. The patients are sent for another scan, or often are simply referred to the consultant whom they would have seen under the old system, who then usually orders a further scan at his or her own site. What started off as a way of saving money and freeing consultants to focus on clear cases of need becomes a bureaucratic process that puts patient outcomes at risk and costs more money as a result of duplication and delay. I should like to know from the Minister whether it is still the case that a patient has a statutory right to see a consultant, and whether a patient can insist on a direct referral from his or her GP without the interposition of additional diagnostic tests.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/22">However, it is not just those diagnostic support services that are being privatised; front-line diagnostic services are being outsourced as well. I am, of course, referring to the NHS 111 service. The service was designed to ease pressures on accident and emergency departments by providing telephone-based triage, but many criticisms have already been made of it. Reference has been made to patients&#8217; calls being answered by medically illiterate staff and to failure to meet targets to transfer calls to a clinician or nurse within 60 seconds or return them within 10 minutes, and there have been stories of patients simply being referred to A and E departments because call centre staff do not know what alternative facilities are available.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/23">I do not wish simply to add to that catalogue of failings. My concern is more specific. In Brent and Harrow, we have an NHS 111 service that was awarded to Harmoni. That in itself was cause for some concern, as the company&#8217;s shareholders included the majority of the Harrow clinical commissioning group board that had decided to award it the contract. However, that is not the potential conflict of interest on which I wish to focus.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/24">The urgent care centre at Central Middlesex hospital happens to be owned by Care UK, the company that also now owns Harmoni. Let me make clear that I am not accusing Care UK of encouraging its NHS 111 staff to make referrals to Central Middlesex in the knowledge that they will benefit from the treatment of any patients at the urgent treatment centre there, because I have no information to suggest that that is the case. Nevertheless, it is clear that there is a serious conflict of interest that any contract must monitor and guard against.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/25">The interests of Care UK are clear, but its performance is not. I wrote to the Secretary of State for Health asking how the service in Brent had performed relative to the service specification. I asked,</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/26">&#8220;how many calls have not been <i>(a)</i> answered, <i>(b)</i> referred to a clinician or trained nurse within the appropriate timescale or <i>(c)</i> in receipt of a call-back from an appropriate clinician within 10 minutes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/27">I received the following response:</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/28">&#8220;Local commissioners are responsible for performance management of NHS 111 services, and set their own performance targets for services&#8230;Data&#8230;is not available in the format requested.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2013-10-23.213"><i>Official Report</i>, 23 October 2013; Vol. 569, c. 213-4W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/29">In other words, the only people responsible for policing such conflicts of interest are the very people who have stood to gain from them.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/30">The final issue I wish to raise with the Minister is that of the National Clinical Assessment Service. In many respects, this could merit an Adjournment debate all of its own. NCAS was established to undertake performance assessments of GPs and clinicians when primary care or hospital trusts had expressed concern that their clinical results or statistics appeared to have been outside normal parameters. There are more than 1,000 referrals a year, and in the vast majority of cases NCAS will assist simply by advising the trust in order to return the clinicians to safe and effective practice. However, in 50 or 60 cases each year an extraordinarily detailed and intensive process of assessment and remediation is required. Only about 60% of those who undergo that process make it back into safe and effective practice, while 40% never return to work in the NHS. NCAS is therefore one of the key guardians of patient safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/31">In 2010, it became clear that NCAS would be restructured as part of the reconfiguration of the NHS. Its budget was cut by 20%, and it was told that it would have to become self-funding by 2013. In 2012, Deloitte was asked to conduct a review of the service, but it is due to publish its report only on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-14">14 November</phrase>, 10 days from now. In April this year, NCAS was joined to the NHS Litigation Authority, which has since consulted on a new structure prior to publication of the Deloitte report.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/32">I understand that senior clinicians in NCAS are deeply worried that the head of the NHSLA has simply dismissed the very serious concerns that senior and experienced practitioners fed into the consultation about the proposals and the impact they might have on patient safety. NCAS is now haemorrhaging junior staff, whom it is allowed to replace only with agency people. The advertisement for a replacement for the senior assessment adviser specifies that the person concerned must be someone on secondment, and for one year only. The restructuring proposals dispense with the post of the director responsible for the &#8220;back on track&#8221; service, but no one else in the service has the clinical capacity to perform the role.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/33">For some 50% of those who come for assessment, previously unidentified patient safety issues are revealed, often involving the cognitive impairment of the clinician himself or herself. I believe that before the proposed changes are allowed to proceed, the Minister must provide satisfactory answers to two questions. First, how will those patient safety concerns be discovered under the new model? Secondly, how will doctors who present a risk to the public be remediated and returned to safe and effective practice, given that the proposal specifically does not replace the key post with the clinical capacity to carry that out?</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/34">The problems and failings I have outlined this evening are not a series of unfortunate but unrelated events, but the logical consequence of a restructured NHS that has put competition and cost, rather than patient care and patient safety, at the heart of the health service. There has been a failure to ensure quality commissioning of the services being provided. In fact, one GP has written to me noting:</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/35">&#8220;It perhaps raises an interesting learning point for the future; that being if GPs are going to commission services and deal with private providers, what mechanisms are in place to stop patients being harmed by&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/36">our</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/37">&#8220;negotiating a less than water tight contract? We are GPs not lawyers.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/38">Certainly with respect to the takeover of the pathology laboratory by TDL, no risk assessment was carried out to predict the potential problems that might arise from a change in both system and process, and no suitable performance measures were implemented, nor was a structure of monitoring put in place to ensure that a good quality of service was maintained. The Health Secretary has been keen to argue that privatising these services is on the basis of improvements to patient welfare and sound clinical evidence. It is not.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/39">The awarding of the contract to Revisecatch Ltd shows that the clinical advice was ignored on the basis of cost, despite the clear implications for patient safety. The irony is that the subsequent change in contract specification almost always results in much higher costs, to the benefit of the private provider.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/40">Patient care and patient safety can only be prioritised in a system where transparency thrives. Only in such a system can mistakes be learned from and become the basis of better future practice, but it is not in the interest of private companies to disclose any aspect of failing service. The root cause analysis report notes:</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/41">&#8220;The report provided by TDL on <phrase class="date" code="2013-03-08">08 March</phrase>, was light on detail in parts and so it was difficult to identify lessons learned. TDL enjoy a good reputation and it is understandable that they would wish to protect this. However, in light of the requirements to put patients first and the duty of openness, transparency and candour, as recommended by Francis, it is felt that all involved could have been more open throughout the process.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/42">This issue of transparency and openness will remain a serious challenge for as long as private companies compete for contracts on the basis of cost.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/43">Too many medical professionals are having to discover to the detriment of their patients that, for all their clinical expertise, they were never trained in the dark arts of commercial contract law, contract specification, negotiation and monitoring. It is the dogma of this Government that has put competition at the heart of our national health service, where patients should rightly be.</p>

	<p pid="b.93.0/1">It is a great pleasure to be speaking in the Chamber under your chairmanship for the first time, Madam Deputy Speaker. I congratulate you on your success in being appointed.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40114" name="Barry Gardiner">the hon. Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner)</phrase> on securing this debate. Before I correct some of the assertions he has made, I want to highlight the fact that the diagnostic services in England, and</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/3">especially in Brent, are in rather robust health under this Government. Average waiting times for a diagnostic test remain low and stable, despite the NHS carrying out over 2 million more key tests a year since May 2010. The percentage of patients waiting six weeks or more at the end of June and July 2013 was 0.9% of the total number of waits. We can therefore see that the number of diagnostic tests is increasing, the availability of diagnostic services to patients has improved under this Government, and very few patients are waiting in excess of six weeks for the services provided.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/4">Latest provisional data from the diagnostic imaging dataset show that almost 32 million imaging tests were reported in England in the 12 months from June 2012 to May 2013. Diagnostics have a key part to play in reducing premature mortality, particularly as NHS England estimates that over 1 billion diagnostics tests are carried out within the NHS every year. Access to safe and high-quality diagnostic services, such as endoscopy, genetics, and imaging, is critical to all clinical pathways. They underpin over 80% of clinical decisions and they contribute to the holistic care of patients, not just single episodes of care.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/5">It is worth reminding the hon. Gentleman that the previous Government introduced, and championed the role of, the private sector. I believe we are all Blairites in this Chamber, in that we all believe in respect of publicly funded care that where the provider&#8212;be it the NHS, a private provider or a local charity or voluntary sector organisation&#8212;gives high-quality patient care, that has to be a good thing because it improves the quality of care. It is also important to highlight that the previous Government introduced private sector providers into the NHS to reduce waiting times for operations, which were unacceptably high at that time. I think we would all agree that it was a good thing that waiting times were reduced so patients no longer had to wait unacceptably long times for treatment they so desperately needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/6">The first independent sector treatment centres were opened in October 2003, under the previous Government, and they gave &#163;250 million to private providers of independent sector treatments. To their shame, they paid the independent sector on average 11% more than the NHS price for the same treatment.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/7">Our intention in the reforms we introduced was to look at the mistakes the previous Government made in commissioning private sector services, to make sure there was a level playing field. There is no competition on price, as the hon. Gentleman asserted; there is only competition on quality in NHS services. It is important that any provider of NHS services and care to patients does so in an integrated way that delivers joined-up and integrated care based primarily in the community. Providing early diagnosis and early treatment and improving diagnostic services is a key part of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/8">The big challenge that faces the whole of the NHS and the health and care sector is the fact that many people are living longer, and often with multiple medical conditions like diabetes, dementia and heart disease. The challenge is to make sure that we treat them with dignity and respect. We must also make sure that when we can diagnose a problem or illness early, we do so. That is why we are very proud to have increased the amount of early diagnosis and the number of diagnostic tests available in our NHS. The remaining challenge is to make sure we continue improving early diagnosis in Brent, London and throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/9">We know that when disease is diagnosed early, patients have a better chance of a good outcome. One-year survival for kidney and bladder cancers is as high as between 92% and 97%. At a late stage, however, it drops to between just 25% and 34%. The clinical case for early diagnosis and the investment we are making in diagnostic services is very clear, therefore.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/10">Of course, apart from the clinical benefits of early diagnosis, there are other benefits. When people are ill, they want to know as soon as possible what might, or might not, be the cause of their illness. Having to wait a long time for diagnostic tests can be hugely stressful for patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/11">Let me deal with the issues the hon. Gentleman raised about the commissioning of services. Since the beginning of April 2013, clinical commissioning groups have been responsible for commissioning many health care services to meet the requirements of their population. In doing so, CCGs need to ensure that diagnostic services are considered fit for purpose and reflect the needs of the local people as part of their process for commissioning clinical pathways. Local clinicians are best placed to understand the needs of their local population and commission the diagnostic services they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.93.0/12">Local clinicians are commissioning in a way that is increasingly effective in diagnostics and elsewhere, so more choice in diagnostic services is essential. Many patients who require diagnosis&#8212;perhaps an ultrasound scan&#8212;will be working, and traditionally some of the NHS diagnostic models have not embraced seven-day working. We know that it is much easier for working people to access NHS services in the evening or at weekends. Therefore, bringing providers that supply greater choice for patients into the NHS makes it much more likely that patients will receive appropriate services at the right time and in a convenient way. It also increases patient compliance, not only with treatments, but with making sure they have their scans and diagnostics in a timely manner.</p>

	<p pid="b.95.0/1">The Minister rightly says that clinicians are best placed to make clinical judgments about their patients&#8217; needs, and there is no dispute between us on that. My concern is that in a case such as that of TDL the clinicians understood the clinical need but clearly did not have the expertise to ensure: that the contract was properly engaged in; that it was risk-assessed in the first place; that it was properly monitored; and that it was executed in a manner that was going to ensure the proper relationship between the practitioner and the tests that were being done. Similarly, on the courier service, they had the clinical evidence right, saying that refrigeration was needed, but when it came to putting the contract in place there was no such refrigeration.</p>

	<p pid="b.95.1/1">I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me for saying that many of the contracts to which he is alluding were put in place under the old arrangements, before this Government&#8217;s reforms, which have delivered clinical leadership. Many of these contracts were negotiated under the powers put in place under the previous Government, whereby people without clinical experience often negotiated the contracts and so did not always understand what the important clinical factors</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/2">were. He rightly raised the point about potassium and the refrigeration of biochemical samples. It is important that we preserve the integrity of all samples collected. Of course, a clinician, a biochemist or someone with clinical experience would understand that, whereas someone who is commissioning services without that background might not. We saw that happen far too often with primary care trusts. The clinical input under the new arrangements will put us in a much better place to commission services in the future. Many clinical commissioning groups have been saddled with those old arrangements and so are having to enforce arrangements and contracts that they did not directly negotiate. We hope that when the contracts come up for renegotiation that problem will be put right, thanks to the reforms that we have introduced. They will lead to clinical leadership at CCGs, so that doctors and nurses are in charge of negotiations, rather than people who have not necessarily had the relevant clinical experience and do not have the knowledge to understand what the contract they are commissioning is about. National frameworks are being developed for some commissioning contracts by NHS England. So if concerns arise locally on the part of a CCG about the commissioning of contracts, NHS England is always available to provide advice.</p>
	<p pid="b.95.1/3">I wish to reassure the hon. Gentleman that not just any old health care provider can deliver diagnostic services. By law, health care providers must register with the Care Quality Commission to carry out diagnostic services. That helps to ensure that patients receive only high-quality care, because the CQC, to which the Government are granting greater independence and strengthened powers to intervene where there are quality of care concerns, is the organisation that will be able to intercede if there are concerns about the quality of any health care service which may affect patient care. Service providers must be registered with the CQC and they must prove that they can meet strict quality criteria. That regulated activity includes a wide range of procedures related to diagnostics, screening and physiological measurement, including all diagnostic procedures involving the use of any form of radiation, including X-ray, ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging. Regulated activities are listed in schedule 1 of the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010.</p>

	<p pid="b.96.0/1">The Minister will have been aware of the report on TDL in north-west London and in no sense could it have been said that a satisfactory service was being delivered. So why did the CQC not intervene in a timely fashion? Why, when the initial report by the GP was made about a serious incident, was it not taken seriously? Why did it take so long to make sure that these services were being provided properly and that my constituents were being kept safe?</p>

	<p pid="b.96.1/1">Clearly, the events that the hon. Gentleman has raised were distressing and appear to have caused difficulties for patients, and I know that local commissioners found that regrettable. I do not know whether the case was reported to the CQC. He will also be aware that the CQC has come on a considerable journey, from being an organisation that was not fit for purpose a few years ago to being an organisation, with new chief inspectors in place, that is in a much more robust state of health now. The Secretary of State has put in place a number</p>
	<p pid="b.96.1/2">of measures to beef up and improve the inspection regimes in all care settings. We now have a chief inspector of care, a chief inspector of hospitals and a chief inspector of general practice. Following the Francis inquiry, there is now much more transparency, openness and passing of information between health care commissioners at a local level and the CQC. That did not happen as effectively as it should have done in the past, and that was to the detriment of those in Brent.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.1/1">Indeed, and the Francis inquiry took place this year and a lot of action has been put in place by the Secretary of State to recognise where there have been failings in the health system in the past. We know that the majority of the health service, however it is commissioned, be it through a provider of NHS services, through the voluntary sector or through private providers, provides fantastic care on a day-to-day basis. We are proud that we have a publicly funded health service that has many fantastic front-line staff&#8212;I count myself still to be one&#8212;who do a very good job of looking after patients.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/2">We know that things sometimes go wrong: the hon. Gentleman has highlighted what went wrong in his constituency and in the wider NHS things went wrong, very tragically, at Mid Staffordshire. We need to learn from those mistakes and ensure that they are put right in future, whether they are in the commissioning process&#8212;clinically led commissioning should put us in a much better place in that regard&#8212;or in the care that is provided to patients. We need to ensure that all hospitals, as well as other health care providers and care sector providers, step up to the plate, recognise that patient safety must always be paramount and ensure that the lessons that need to be learned from the Francis report are learned. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will report back to the House in due course&#8212;later this month, I believe&#8212;with further recommendations that will, I hope, reassure the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/3">In conclusion, let me turn specifically to diagnostic services in Brent. I am aware that the hon. Gentleman has recently asked questions about referral processes for diagnostic services provided in his constituency. As he knows, the contracts for those services were originally</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/4">let by the then PCT under arrangements encouraged by the policies of the previous Government and are managed by the North and East London commissioning support unit on behalf of the CCGs. The London NHS Diagnostic Service, provided by InHealth, offers GPs and other health care professionals direct access to high-quality diagnostic and imaging scans and tests throughout London delivered from a range of sites, including mobile, fixed and community-based facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/5">I hope that it reassures the hon. Gentleman to hear that between September 2010 and August 2011, 2,397,018 diagnostic tests were carried out in London but more recently, between September 2012 and August 2013, there was an increase of about 300,000 to 2,651,560. That shows that the service in London is in robust health and is being used to facilitate scans and other procedures to diagnose many more patients today than two to three years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/6">I understand that the hon. Gentleman has been in communication with local commissioners and that the relevant NHS England area team has advised him that GP practices do not receive any referral payment when patients are referred to the London NHS Diagnostic Service provided by InHealth. I know that that is an area of concern to him and he was possibly suggesting that there might be some cosy internal relationship among local health care services to the detriment of patients. I can reassure him that that is certainly not the case. GPs make clinical decisions on the basis not of financial bribes, but of what is best for their patients. I hope that he will be reassured by the answer he has received from the commissioners and I do not think that it is in any way likely that GPs or other health care professionals will act in a way that is outside the best interests of their patients. It has always been my experience that front-line health care professionals, with very few exceptions, act with openness and integrity and always advocate for their patients&#8217; needs. I hope he will be reassured by that.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/7">I hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured that diagnostic services are in robust health under this Government nationally, and in Brent.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
