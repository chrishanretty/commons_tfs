I am interested in an ecologically coherent network that can stand up to the independent scientific advisory panel, which stated that some of the 127 sites did not have enough scientific evidence to support them. When introducing the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, the then Government said, quite rightly, that the zones needed to be evidence-based.

	<p pid="a.978.4/1">The Minister&#8217;s Department insists that a lack of scientific certainty should not be used as an excuse to delay the establishment of marine conservation zones. Three and a half years after Labour&#8217;s world-leading Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009, and &#163;8.5 million, the latest nature watch report by the Wildlife and Countryside Link has awarded Ministers a black mark for their inaction.

A couple of weeks ago, those on the Labour Front Bench were wrongly accusing the Government of ignoring scientific advice. The hon.

The establishment of marine conservation zones must be done properly and stand up in terms of evidence. In the full spirit of the 2009 Act, on which all parties agreed, we must have absolute clarity on what is meant by ecological coherence, and we will get there.</p>

Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Sir James Paice)</phrase>, the industry code of practice is now being translated into contracts. I am encouraged to hear of new contracts and pricing mechanisms that improve the transparency and fairness of milk prices for farmers.

	<p pid="a.979.1/1">There has been a dairy herd of Holstein Friesians in Eggington, outside Leighton Buzzard, since 1933, but I was concerned to learn from the farmer in July that he is not confident that milk production can continue there, which would be an absolute tragedy. The farmer told me last night that he receives 30.5p per litre, but when I checked this morning, Tesco was selling milk for 86.3p per litre, which is 49p a pint. Is the Minister sure that farmers are getting a fair share, and what can we do to ensure they have a sustainable future?</p>

If we can make the voluntary code stick&#8212;I have no reason to suppose we cannot&#8212;it will go a very long way to improving the transparency of contracts, and, as the hon. Gentleman knows, the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill is going through the House. The Department will do everything it can to maintain the profitability of producers and ensure that every part of the supply chain is fairly treated, including the retailer and the consumer.</p>

Last week, I visited Exeter and Kennford to talk about flooding with local communities there.

It seeks to ensure that development is located away from flood risk wherever possible; that the development that is needed in flood-risk areas is safe and resilient; that flood risk is assessed so it can be avoided and managed; and that opportunities offered by new development are used to reduce the causes and impacts of flooding.</p>

Friend, the Under-Secretary of State, will have seen the heart-wrenching devastation caused by terrible flooding last weekend in the town of Malmesbury in my constituency. They were not new houses on flood plains; 500-year-old cottages on the verge of the river were particularly badly affected. The people there are badly affected by the fact that they cannot get contents</p>

	<p pid="a.982.1/2">Last week, there was an announcement of a new &#163;120 million U-turn on flood defence spending. However, even after that announcement, the Government will still spend less on flood defences in 2013 than Labour spent in 2008. Just 30% of that money will be spent next year because the Environment Agency no longer has the staff capacity to get the money out of the door. It is difficult to decide which is more incompetent: cutting the budget too far in the first place or, when they change their mind, not having the capacity to get the money out of the door and to the communities that need it.</p>

	<p pid="a.982.2/1">I love the way the hon. Lady always looks for the downside in a story&#8212;her ingenuity is tremendous. The fact is that on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-11">11 September</phrase>, within a week of coming in, I met the chairman of the Environment Agency, Lord Smith. We saw a great scheme, which, in fairness, her Government launched in Nottingham. I asked him to come forward with proposals for future flood schemes, as the benefits in Nottingham were clear&#8212;not just 16,000 houses protected by the &#163;45 million scheme, but the 500 acres freed up for development, which had previously been blighted. He wrote to me, quickly, on <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-26">26 September</phrase>, and I am happy to give the hon. Lady the letter. We have put what he asked for into practice, to the letter: another &#163;120 million, which will be of great benefit and save a further 60,000 houses from flooding.</p>

	<p pid="a.982.4/1">Of course, it is great to build flood defences, but it is just as important to maintain the ones we already have and to keep our rivers clear. Yesterday, however, the Chancellor announced that a further &#163;60 million would be cut from DEFRA&#8217;s budget, so can the Secretary of State guarantee that no further cuts will fall on the Environment Agency&#8217;s river-dredging and maintenance budget, which is already set to fall from &#163;108 million in 2010 to just &#163;60 million in 2015?</p>

I have to go back to my early reading, when I came into the House, of &#8220;Erskine May&#8221;, but she must stick to the truth on these issues.

We have successfully ensured that provisions for people with light-sensitive health conditions were included in a new eco-design regulation that sets minimum standards for directional lighting and light-emitting diodes.</p>

I think all Members of this House understand how urgent the question is. If fresh legislation is to be passed by the current Synod, it is very important that members of the Church can lobby Synod in a proper way. The Church has published how members of Synod voted but not indicated to which dioceses they belong. Could that also be put up on the website so that people can lobby intelligently?</p>

	<p pid="a.996.2/1">The membership of deanery synods has constituted the electorate for the House of Laity since the General Synod was created in 1970. The review of synodical government chaired by Lord Bridge of Harwich recommended in 1977 that deanery synods should be abolished and that the lay members of diocesan synods and General Synods should be chosen by parish representatives, each parish to have one for every 50 people on the electoral roll. The General Synod decided, however, to retain deanery synods. In July 2011 the Synod decided to ask for alternatives to the present electoral system to be further explored. The review group&#8217;s report is due to come to the General Synod this coming year.</p>

	<p pid="a.996.3/1">Does not the complete failure of the House of Laity in the General Synod to reflect the overwhelming support in the diocesan synods for women bishops show that there is something deeply wrong with the system?

I am sure that the Archbishop of Canterbury-designate will able to reassure colleagues next week that it is getting on with it. So far as the format of General Synod is concerned, as I have said to the House on a number of occasions, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to explain how 42 out of 44 dioceses voted for women bishops, yet the motion failed in General Synod. I think that the next Archbishop of Canterbury will want to focus on growth in the Church, and if one wants to focus on growth, one needs to make sure that everyone feels involved. I hope, personally, that in due course we will be able to move to a system in which every member of the Church who is on an electoral roll has a vote for those who go to General Synod. That seems to be a straightforward system.</p>

	<p pid="a.997.4/1">I, however, have something to add. The Second Church Commissioner&#8217;s last point was absolutely right: this is not a sect we are dealing with.

	<p pid="a.997.5/1">I am quite sure that the review that is taking place into the way people are elected to General Synod will try to ensure the greatest opportunity for people in the Church to have a vote and feel that they are represented. Parliament, for example, decided long ago that all of us&#8212;everyone in every parish&#8212;have a vote in elections for church wardens. One would think that at the very least in elections to General Synod everyone on a church electoral roll should have a vote.</p>

	<p pid="a.1001.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for announcing the business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/2">I have previously asked the predecessor of the Leader of the House about equal marriage legislation. Every piece of equality legislation since the decriminalisation of homosexuality was passed by the previous Labour Government. We fully support plans to introduce equal marriage. Couples planning their future need certainty from the Government, not prevarication. The Government&#8217;s legislative timetable is not exactly packed, so will the Leader of the House commit to bringing forward legislation in this Session?</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/3">We are grateful to the Leader of the House for arranging a debate on the Leveson report earlier this week. I congratulate Lord Justice Leveson on his report and his careful consideration of the evidence. The status quo is unacceptable; the victims of press intrusion deserve better. We welcome cross-party talks on how to implement the report, but there are clear divisions on the report between us and Conservative Front Benchers. Will the right hon. Gentleman therefore commit to making available Government time for a vote on the proposals and, if there is a majority, time for the legislation that would follow?</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/4">Will the right hon. Gentleman join me in welcoming to the House the new Labour Members, my hon. Friends the Members for Rotherham (Sarah Champion), for Middlesbrough (Andy McDonald) and for Croydon</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/5">North (Steve Reed)? I have been looking at by-election history. In 2008, there was a by-election in Henley in which the then governing party came fifth. At the time, the leader of the Liberal Democrats said that showed that Labour was &#8220;finished&#8221;. In the Rotherham by-election, the Liberal Democrats managed to scrape into eighth place, behind Labour, the UK Independence party, the British National party, Respect, the Conservatives, the English Democrats and a local vicar. Can the Leader of the House say whether the Deputy Prime Minister will be making a statement on the outlook for his party after this debacle?</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/6">Yesterday we found out the full scale of the Government&#8217;s economic failure. The Prime Minister promised to balance the books by 2015, but he has broken that promise. The Chancellor promised to cut borrowing, but borrowing and debt figures have been revised up this year and for future years. The Government promised to grow the economy, but yesterday the Office for Budget Responsibility said that the economy would contract this year. The part-time Chancellor might try 4G Del Boy economics to hide his failure, but he cannot hide the truth. According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies, this is the worst economic outlook since the 1920s. This is the consequence of a Government who got all the big decisions wrong. In October 2010, the Chancellor said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/7">&#8220;What investor is going to come to the UK when they fear a downgrade of our credit rating?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/8">He then claimed that the rating was safe in his hands, but this morning it is clear that the Chancellor&#8217;s economic failure has put his prized triple A rating at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/9">The measures announced in yesterday&#8217;s autumn statement will, according to the Treasury&#8217;s own figures, hit the poorest half of the country hardest. Those in work on modest earnings are paying the bill for this Government&#8217;s mismanagement of the economy, and at the same time the Government are giving a &#163;100,000-a-year tax cut to the richest 8,000 people. How is that fair? We had an explanation yesterday in a Liberal Democrat briefing :</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/10">&#8220;The only tax cuts the Tories support are ones for the very rich&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/11">Helpful clarification was then offered by the Business Secretary, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/12">&#8220;We have a different view to the Conservatives&#8230;on fairness&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/13">Does the Leader of the House not think that a debate on fairness would give the Liberal Democrats the opportunity to remind themselves that they actually voted to give a tax cut to the richest 1%, and will he allow time for such a debate?</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/14">After yesterday&#8217;s autumn statement, we know that the Government are borrowing &#163;212 billion more than expected, that the benefit bill is &#163;13 billion higher, that growth forecasts have been cut this year, next year and for every year until 2016, and that the Government have failed the only economic tests they set themselves. This is the price of economic failure. For all the Chancellor&#8217;s sleight of hand yesterday, the Treasury&#8217;s own figures reveal that the economy has not grown, that borrowing is up, that growth will be less, that spending will be cut and that unemployment will go up. This is the record of a Government who have made the wrong choices. This is the consequence of an economic strategy that is not working.</p>

	<p pid="a.1003.0/1">I am grateful to the shadow Leader of the House for her response to my statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.0/2">There is no prevarication whatsoever on equal marriage. We have been very clear that, following the consultation, my right hon. Friend the Minister for Women and Equalities will respond before Christmas, and indeed she will. I look forward to that and I hope that it will demonstrate our further determination to secure equal marriage, which was not achieved under a Labour Government, but can now be achieved under a coalition Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.0/3">I am grateful for what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40626" name="Angela Eagle">the hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle)</phrase> said about a debate on Leveson. It reminded me that when we discussed House business this time last week, the Leveson report had not been published. Doesn&#8217;t time fly when you&#8217;re having fun? I say to the hon. Lady that it is a bit premature to discuss the nature of future business of the House in relation to the Leveson report while my right hon. Friends, and indeed those on her own Front Bench, are engaged in discussions between themselves and with the newspaper editors, who have taken away from the Prime Minister and others the message that they must come up with plans that meet the Leveson principles and do so rapidly. We will hear more about that, I hope, later today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.0/4">I will indeed take this opportunity to welcome the new Members of the House. The hon. Lady kindly wrapped that question with a reference to the 2008 Henley by-election. Ever since that day, the House has been graced with the presence of my parliamentary private secretary. If the new Members do half as well as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40311" name="John Howell">the Member for Henley (John Howell)</phrase> has done, they will do very well indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.0/5">Most of what the hon. Lady had to say was about the autumn statement. She used it as an opportunity to try to restore the credibility of the Opposition&#8217;s Front Benchers after the lamentable failure of the shadow Chancellor yesterday, who had no idea what he wanted to say and was utterly confused. The truth of the matter is that my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was able not only to maintain this country&#8217;s credibility in his determination to reduce the deficit&#8212;the deficit is coming down&#8212;but to say that inflation has come down, that we are making considerable strides forward in many of the emerging markets and that employment has been rising. There are 1.2 million more jobs in the private sector, and the Office for Budget Responsibility says that at least two new jobs will be created in the private sector for every job that is lost in the public sector as a consequence of the inescapable necessity to control borrowing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.0/6">I heard nothing from the hon. Lady about how the Labour party would control borrowing. Where would the Labour party&#8217;s deficit reduction plan come from? We hear nothing about that. She talked about fairness and taxes for the richest, but she will have noticed that the Chancellor&#8217;s autumn statement set out an intention to increase taxation of the richest. It is clear from the distributional consequences of the autumn statement that those with the broadest shoulders are bearing the biggest burdens. We have not heard from the Opposition whether they would go back to the 50p rate if they were ever back in government. We just do not know.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.0/7">Under the coalition Government, the personal tax allowance will have gone from &#163;6,475 to &#163;9,440 under the plans announced by the Chancellor&#8212;within touching</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.0/8">distance of a &#163;10,000 personal tax allowance. Some 24 million taxpayers and their families will benefit from that and we are taking 2 million people out of tax altogether. Somebody working full time on a minimum wage will have seen their tax bill more than halve. When the hon. Lady talks about fairness, I think that we should talk about that kind of fairness too.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.0/9">I did not hear from the hon. Lady, on a practical question about the business of the House, whether the Opposition will vote for or against the welfare uprating Bill when it comes before the House. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> She says from a sedentary position that we will have to wait and see. It is just like yesterday. The shadow Chancellor and the hon. Lady do not have a clue what they would do.</p>

	<p pid="a.1004.2/1">Can the Chancellor come to the Dispatch Box and tell the House what consideration he has given to the impact of the rise in the pensionable age on those in receipt of permanent health insurance payments under schemes that were designed to end at the current retirement age?</p>

We are having a debate on the economy next Tuesday, which will present an opportunity to discuss many of the issues that have arisen from the autumn statement.

It is worth noting that, not least because of the support that we are giving to the national health service, the number of people in this country who have private health insurance has gone down.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005.1/1">The Leader of the House will know that in the fog of gloom and misery that was yesterday&#8217;s autumn statement, some of us were expecting the Chancellor to make just a little announcement about how he was going to go after the big multinational companies that do not pay any tax&#8212;Google, coffee giants and water companies&#8212;and get some money for all those years that they have paid nothing.

From what was announced yesterday it is transparent that the Government are not proposing regional pay, and that is in line with evidence I gave to the NHS pay review body earlier in the year as Secretary of State for Health.

One must make a judgment. We cannot keep reducing the top rate of tax and hope continually to increase revenue, but it is important to support entrepreneurship and wealth creators.

The point he makes is important, and the Energy Bill, which has now been introduced to the House, gives that sense of progress and security. I remember several years ago the then Trade and Industry Select Committee constantly being told by the last Government that they were keeping the door open to nuclear power, but it was not true: simply because they were not doing anything about it, the door was closing. We are now recognising that nuclear power, as a base load capacity, is an essential part of our energy security.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010.6/1">On <phrase class="date" code="1971-12-04">4 December 1971</phrase>, McGurk&#8217;s bar was blown up by an Ulster Volunteer Force bomb, killing my uncle,</p>

On the 41st anniversary, a book was published by Ciar&#225;n MacAirt, whose grandmother, Kathleen Irvine, was also killed by the bomb. After all the years of investigation, there are still closed files and letters not available, and there was collusion. Clearly, the British Government, possibly up to the then Prime Minister, Edward Heath, colluded and not only co-operated, but instructed that the false story be spread that this was a bomb carried by the people into that bar and that it was an IRA bomb in transit. Is it not now time for a proper investigation by the British Government into the facts of the case, with all the files being open and the Prime Minister coming here to apologise to the families and community for how they were maligned and, for six years, blamed for a bomb that was clearly a vicious act against them?</p>

It is now well past the autumn, so I wonder whether the Leader of the House would investigate where this Bill has got to?</p>

	<p pid="a.1016.4/1">When businesses sacked staff by text message, that was rightly condemned throughout the country. People said that it was cowardly and despicable. When, a few years ago, Burberry announced the closure of its factory in Treorchy at the beginning of December, that was condemned as well, on the grounds that it was the wrong time of the year to do such a thing. Today, the Government have done both those things together: they have announced by e-mail that a lot of people working in Remploy factories are to lose their jobs, and they have done it in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016.4/2">In a way, I almost do not want the Leader of the House to respond to what I have said, but I do want him to think about this. Please, please may we have an oral statement on Monday?

	<p pid="a.1017.0/1">I think I have made it clear to the House that, in my view, informing the House by means of a written ministerial statement is perfectly proper. An oral statement is not simply an expression of the importance of an issue; it is made by a Minister who is announcing policy, and, as far as I am aware, what was conveyed in the written ministerial statement did not represent any change in policy. It recognised that, as had been anticipated, the Remploy board would conclude its assessment of the stage 2 businesses. Remploy is working closely with the Department for Work and Pensions, and the Department has kept the House fully informed, but the statement did not represent any change of policy on the part of the Department.</p>

	<p pid="a.1018.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on what went wrong with the west coast franchise agreement and what we are doing to put things right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/2">I shall begin by updating the House on the Laidlaw inquiry, and on the decisive action that we are taking in response. I shall then inform the House of the new deal with Virgin Trains&#8212;including an enhanced service&#8212;that will begin this weekend. My approach to all this, from the start, has been to come to the House to explain the situation openly, quickly and clearly, and it is in that spirit that I make my third statement on the subject today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/3">Let me deal first with the Laidlaw inquiry. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-03">3 October</phrase>, I announced the cancellation of the competition to run the inter-city west coast franchise because of the discovery of unacceptable flaws in the process run by the Department for Transport. As I explained to the House on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-15">15 October</phrase>, I launched two independent inquiries. I asked the first inquiry body, led by Sam Laidlaw, to look into what happened and why, and I am publishing Mr Laidlaw&#8217;s final report today. I asked the second body, led by the Eurostar chairman, Richard Brown, to focus on any lessons to be learnt for the purpose of future rail franchising. That inquiry is well advanced, and I expect to receive Mr Brown&#8217;s report by the end of the year. I shall publish it after that. I have placed a copy of Mr Laidlaw&#8217;s final report in the Vote Office, and I am placing a copy of my Department&#8217;s response to it in the Library. I do not hide from the seriousness of his findings. They make extremely uncomfortable reading for the Department. What happened caused serious problems for bidding firms, including FirstGroup, which was in no way at fault. Action must, and will, be taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/4">Let me turn to the detail. Mr Laidlaw confirms much of what he first touched on in his interim report. He finds that the Department wrongly calculated the amount of risk capital bidders would have to offer to guarantee their franchise proposals against default, and he says that these incorrect figures were varied in ways that were wrong. Significantly, he also states for the first time that Ministers made the original <phrase class="date" code="2012-08-14">14 August</phrase> provisional award without being told about the flaws and after being given &#8220;inaccurate reports&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/5">Mr Laidlaw also confirms that if his recommendations on strengthening the organisation are acted upon quickly, the Department will be able to do its job correctly in the future. There is nothing in the report to suggest that the flaws discovered in this franchise competition existed in other procurements in the Department.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/6">Finally, Mr Laidlaw confirms that he has seen no evidence of bias against Virgin. He also offers a clear prescription, which we are already acting on. The Department will ensure that all future franchise competitions are delivered with a clear timeline, rigorous management and the right quality assurance. We will also create a simpler and clearer structure and governance process for rail franchise competitions. That will include the appointment of a single director general with responsibility for all rail policy and franchising, and we</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/7">will ensure that we have the right mix of professional skills inside the Department and, where necessary, from professional external advisers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/8">I thank Mr Laidlaw for carrying out such a comprehensive review to such a tight timetable. Any specific personnel issues resulting from what has gone on are&#8212;and must, of course, remain&#8212;for the permanent secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/9">Secondly, let me turn to the future of the west coast main line. In all my actions, I have put the service to passengers first. That is why I am pleased to tell the House that my Department has negotiated terms with Virgin Rail Group to allow Virgin Trains to continue running the west coast service for up to 23 months. Our intention is to run a full competition for the longer term franchise to follow on from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/10">The terms we have negotiated with Virgin secure a continued service for passengers at the same levels they enjoy today, and in some cases better. The timetable that was already agreed for December 2012 will operate, and today the last of the 106 Government-funded Pendolino carriages comes into service. That will allow more trains and longer trains on this vital route. That timetable includes a new hourly service between London and Glasgow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/11">I also want to see more improvements, including the introduction of new services from London to Blackpool and Shrewsbury. Subject to Virgin securing the track access rights to provide them and to our completing a value-for-money assessment, I hope that both of these new services will be introduced from December 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/12">The Laidlaw inquiry has told us that changes to the Department&#8217;s governance and structure are needed. We are carrying them out, and we have a new deal for the west coast main line. This has been an extremely serious issue for my Department and for the civil service, but I am determined that we learn the lessons and get on with the job we are here to do. With our commitment to High Speed 2 and the increase in capital spending on roads announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer this week, the Government are committed to improving our transport network and backing our railways. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1019.0/1">First, may I thank the Secretary of State for early sight of his statement and the report?</p>
	<p pid="a.1019.0/2">The Secretary of State conceded to the Transport Committee that what had been uncovered even in the Laidlaw inquiry interim report was &#8220;damning&#8221;. It is, indeed, damning, and the final report is even more so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019.0/3">For all the efforts by the Government in briefing after briefing to pin the blame on just three civil servants and to hide behind an internal human resources process, the results of which will never be made public, some things are very clear. It was decisions and failures by Ministers that led to the collapse of rail franchising, at huge cost to the taxpayer. The Laidlaw report is clear. It was Ministers who decided to change franchising policy; they decided not just to move to longer franchises, but to replace a revenue-risk sharing mechanism that</p>
	<p pid="a.1019.0/4">had worked for many years with a complex new model requiring a best guess at GDP 15 years ahead. It was Ministers who oversaw a bizarre structural reorganisation of the Department that left no one in charge of rail. The Secretary of State has now said he will reverse that&#8212; finally, we have an acceptance of ministerial responsibility. It was Ministers who chose to axe more than a third of the staff at the Department in a year, with little thought for the consequences of the loss of expertise. And it was Ministers who axed external audits, removing quality assurance from the process. These were deliberate decisions taken by this incompetent Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019.0/5">It was also Ministers who failed to act when warning after warning was flagged up to them as this franchise unravelled. Why did alarm bells not ring at the fact that this process had not one but three senior responsible owners? It is not surprising that the Laidlaw report proposes just one in future&#8212;that is the whole purpose of a senior responsible owner. Does the Secretary of State not accept that Ministers have an obligation to ask questions and not just rely on what they are being told, not least when they are spending hundreds of millions of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money? It is clear from this report that they failed completely in their responsibility to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1019.0/6">The Secretary of State must now give taxpayers and fare payers some straight answers. First, has he received clear legal advice that will reassure taxpayers that he has not left the Department open to legal challenge as a result of his decision to hand out a two-year contract with no competition? Secondly, are reports correct that he has agreed a quid pro quo deal with First, whereby it will be granted an extension on its First Great Western franchise on a similar basis? Thirdly, the Government expected to receive tens of millions of pounds in dividend payments over the next two years from the west coast franchise and would have received more than &#163;800 million from the great western franchise had First not exercised its right not to extend that contract&#8212;can the Secretary of State confirm that, under the management contracts he has been forced into, taxpayers will receive none of those payments? Fourthly, the terms of the deal that has been struck with Virgin allow the margin of 1% on revenue agreed for the first year to rise for the second&#8212;by how much could it rise and at what cost to the taxpayer? Finally, will the Secretary of State now come clean with the House on the full cost to taxpayers of the collapse of the Government&#8217;s franchising programme? There are media reports from the industry that the final cost could run into not tens of millions but hundreds of millions of pounds. Will he tell the House, taxpayers and fare payers what figure he has been given by his officials?</p>
	<p pid="a.1019.0/7">Despite all the Secretary of State&#8217;s efforts, no one is going to fall for the Government&#8217;s attempt to wriggle off the hook and evade responsibility for this shambles. They can devise a complex process of multiple reviews, they can hide behind confidentiality and legal privilege, and they can reshuffle Ministers as many times as they like, but the truth is that when commuters go back to work in the new year and find that their fares have gone up by as much as 6% above inflation they will know that it was Ministers from this incompetent Government who, instead of imposing a strict cap on fare rises, blew taxpayers&#8217; money on this franchise fiasco.</p>

	<p pid="a.1021.0/1">I had hoped that I had given the hon. Lady adequate time to read the report, but it seems that I did not. First, I will deal with her points about Ministers. I refer her to page 44, where paragraph 4.118.2 says that</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/2">&#8220;inaccurate statements were made to the then Minister of State in writing as to the manner in which the CAC&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/3">the contract award committee&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/4">&#8220;had approached the SLF sizing process in respect of First&#8217;s bid at its meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-27">27 June</phrase>&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/5">If inaccurate information was given to Ministers, a fact stated in the report, Ministers would have acted in good faith on the information they were given.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/6">May I also make the point that is made on page 63 of the report? It states that</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/7">&#8220;in implementing substantial cost savings required by the Government&#8217;s spending review in 2010, the DfT significantly reduced its headcount, the number of contractors used and its use of external consultants.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/8">Mr Laidlaw goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/9">&#8220;That is not to say however that, with appropriate escalation&#8230;of the issues, sufficient resources could not or would not have been found.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/10">There was no significant escalation of the issue, so I think there is truth in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/11">A number of parts of the report refer to the Minister of State, the Secretary of State, the Prime Minister and the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" name="Norman Baker">the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>, asking questions and I am afraid that there was a damning failure by the Department that must be put right. The hon. Lady says that I seek somehow to blame three civil servants. I have never, in any of the statements I have made in the House or privately, mentioned the names of any civil servants. That is a matter for the permanent secretary. We now have the HR report and the permanent secretary is considering that and what will happen in the future. I would have hoped that the hon. Lady would welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/12">The hon. Lady talks about the position with First Great Western and its contract to run its railway line. May I remind her who negotiated that contract? It was inherited by the Government and was not our contract at all. If she feels that there are any problems with it, then excuse me but it is not the responsibility of the Government. She asked a specific question about the second year of the contract with Virgin Trains and I will write to her with the answer.</p>

Although of course matters of personnel in his Department are, as he says, the responsibility of the permanent secretary, the overall administration was the responsibility of his predecessor and it is unacceptable that she complacently remains a member of the Government having left this expensive mess. I am travelling up to my home in Manchester this afternoon. What am I to say to the excellent train crew who will be looking after me and all the other passengers about the security of their jobs, in which they have the right to be confident and which has been left in total dubiety by what happened before the Secretary of State took over?</p>

What he can say to the crew on the west coast main line is that both this Government and, in fairness, the previous Government have invested huge amounts of public money in that line&#8212;some &#163;9 billion. I am glad to be able to say today that we have completed the delivery of the 106 new Pendolino carriages to show our support for that line. I hope that my announcement today and the fact that I have not done what I initially said I would do, which was a short-term contract, then a medium-term contract, gives train crew security and that they can work with their company for the future franchise.</p>

	<p pid="a.1024.2/1">Edinburgh is served by both the west coast main line and the east coast main line services, and between the two there have been three occasions in recent years when the franchise process has gone wrong. Given that the Government will have to sort out the franchise system, not just for the west coast main line, would it not make sense now to decide to keep services on the east coast main line operated by the current operator and allow it to get the benefits of closer co-operation with Network Rail, rather than force it to go through a franchise process again?</p>

	Benefits Uprating (2013-14)

	<p pid="a.1030.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement about the uprating of social security benefits and pensions for 2013-14. I shall place in the Vote Office full details of the new rates that are due to come into force from the week of <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-08">8 April 2013</phrase> for each pension and benefit, and arrange for copies of a schedule of the new rates to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. As part of his statement yesterday, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced the rates of tax credits for 2013-14. Today, I will announce the uprating of the social security benefits and pensions for which my Department is responsible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/2">Even in these difficult times, the coalition Government have stood by their promise for those who have worked hard all their lives. Specifically, we will honour our triple guarantee commitment to increase the basic state pension by the greater of earnings, prices or 2.5%. As prices and average earnings for September 2012 were below 2.5%, the floor of our triple guarantee is activated. Therefore, even while earnings growth remains slow, we will not repeat a small rise like the 75p rise in 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/3">From April 2013, the new rate of the basic state pension will be &#163;110.15 a week for a single person, which is up &#163;2.70 a week on last year. The House may be interested to hear that that means that the basic state pension is forecast to be almost 18% of average earnings&#8212;a higher share than at any time in the past 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/4">Let me turn to additional state pensions, which are often referred to as state earnings-related pension schemes or SERPS. Unlike the Labour party, which froze SERPS in 2010, the coalition uprated SERPS by the full value of the consumer prices index in 2011 and 2012. I am pleased to announce that this year SERPS pensions will rise by 2.2%, which means that the total state pension increase for someone with a full basic state pension and an average additional pension will be &#163;3.35 a week or around &#163;175 a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/5">On pension credit, each year the standard minimum guarantee must be increased at least in line with earnings. That would imply an increase of 1.6% for 2013, which would mean our poorest pensioners receiving a smaller increase than the one we are paying for the basic state pension. We think that would be unfair, so I am pleased to announce that we will make equivalent arrangements to those that we put in place last year, which will increase the standard minimum guarantee by the increase in the cash value of the basic state pension. From next year, the single person rate of the guarantee credit will rise by &#163;2.70, taking the weekly income from this safety-net benefit to &#163;145.40. For couples, the increase will be &#163;4.15, taking their new total to &#163;222.05 a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/6">Also consistent with our approach last year, the resources needed to pay the above-earnings increase to the standard minimum guarantee will be found by increasing the savings credit threshold, which means that those with higher levels of income may see less of an increase.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/7">This year, the coalition will ensure that those who face additional costs because of their disability and who have less opportunity to increase their income through paid employment will see their benefits increase by the</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/8">full value of CPI. Therefore, disability living allowance, attendance allowance, carer&#8217;s allowance and the main rate of incapacity benefit will all rise by the statutory minimum of 2.2% from April 2013, as will the employment and support allowance support group component and those disability-related premiums that are paid with pension credit and working-age benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/9">In the face of the ongoing challenge to our national economy, we have faced a tough decision on working-age benefits. In exercise of his discretion in the uprating of certain benefits, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has decided that the national economic situation is such that the country simply cannot afford to be as generous as we have been in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/10">There has been speculation about a benefit freeze. However, the Government have found sufficient money to pay a 1% increase for people of working age who claim the main rate of jobseeker&#8217;s allowance or income support, as well as for those on the main rate plus the work-related activity component of employment and support allowance and housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/11">This has been a difficult choice. Where possible, and particularly for those with disabilities, we have sought to protect benefits against inflation. Indeed, we have gone further in the case of the triple guarantee for the basic state pension. Nevertheless, the fiscal position means it has simply not been possible fully to protect every benefit. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor said yesterday, we need to</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/12">&#8220;ensure that we have a welfare system that Britain can afford.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-12-05.879"><i>Official Report</i>, 5 December 2012; Vol. 554, c. 879</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/13">Uprating for 2014 and 2015 will be affected by the welfare uprating Bill that was announced by my right hon. Friend yesterday, and right hon. and hon. Members will be able to debate these matters further during the passage of that Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/14">At the June 2010 emergency Budget the Government announced that from 2013, rates of local housing allowance would be calculated annually by using the lower of the 30th percentile of local rents, or the previous year&#8217;s rate uprated by reference to the consumer prices index. That will end the monthly uprating of LHA and bring the system into line with the uprating of other pensions and benefits. In preparation for that change, the Government fixed LHA rates from April 2012 so as to establish a baseline from which they could be uprated in future. Therefore, from April 2013, LHA rates will be set at the lower of the 30th percentile of local rents or the April 2012 rate increased by 2.2%.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/15">Uprating of LHA for 2014 and 2015 will be in line with the 1% increase for the majority of working-age benefits. LHA rates for 2014 will be set at the lower of the 30th percentile of local rents, or the April 2013 rate increased by 1%, and an equivalent approach will follow for 2015. The Government will set aside &#163;140 million over two years to help those people in areas where rent increases are highest or there is a shortage of affordable housing. It is worth noting&#8212;I was surprised by this&#8212;that 44% of LHA rates will not increase next year because local market rents have been stable since those rates were last set, and in a further 13% of cases they have actually fallen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/16">At a time when the nation&#8217;s finances remain under severe pressure, the Government will spend an extra &#163;2.8 billion in 2013-14 to ensure that people are protected against cost of living increases. Around &#163;2.1 billion&#8212;three quarters of the money&#8212;will be spent on state pensions, nearly half a billion pounds will be spent on disabled people and their carers, and nearly &#163;300 million will be spent on people who are unable to work because of sickness or unemployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/17">We have protected the triple lock, taking the basic state pension to its highest level as a percentage of average earnings for two decades. We have protected our poorest pensioners with an over-indexation of the standard minimum guarantee so that they too may benefit from the triple guarantee. We have protected disabled people through increases to disability living allowance and attendance allowance, carer&#8217;s allowance and the main rate of incapacity benefit, in line with CPI, and disability premiums for those on working-age benefits.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.1/18">Even in the face of a challenging national economic situation and the need to find savings to rebalance our economy, we have managed to provide a 1% increase to help support those not in work. In this statement I have outlined the Government&#8217;s ongoing commitment to ensuring that even in these difficult times no one is left behind, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1032.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40083" speakername="Liam Byrne" colnum="1032"  time="012:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0002.htm#12120640001193">
	<p pid="a.1032.0/1">I thank the Minister for advanced sight of his statement, although from yesterday we had a pretty good idea what he was going to say. Today brings welcome news for Britain&#8217;s pensioners. When Labour was in office we lifted 1 million pensioners out of poverty and increased pensioner incomes by 40%. Today the Minister has confirmed that pensions are set to rise, which we welcome, and we look forward to his pensions White Paper, which is now acquiring mythical status&#8212;we hope he will soon be able to prove it is a reality and not a myth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/2">Although the news for pensioners is welcome, news for working people is a disaster. Buried in the small print of yesterday&#8217;s Budget is the brutal truth that it was a Budget for unemployment. We already knew that the Chancellor had throttled the recovery, that the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government had cut hardest those councils where jobs were fewest, and that the Work programme was worse than doing nothing, but yesterday we saw what that means for the nation&#8217;s finances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/3">The Office for Budget Responsibility has revised up the claimant count by 340,000 by 2016. This Budget puts up unemployment, and the bill for that failure is enormous. The dole bill in 2015-16 will now be nearly &#163;1 billion higher&#8212;&#163;1.6 billion more over the next three years. The bill for failure is not going down but up, and yesterday we learned that working people will pay the price.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/4">This country already has more than 6 million working people in poverty. The Resolution Foundation stated yesterday that 60% of the welfare uprating bill will be paid by working people. It is a strivers&#8217; tax. Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury policy costings state that the 1% squeeze will save &#163;6.7 billion. Provisional analysis this morning by the Library shows that just 23% of that will come from</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/5">JSA, ESA and income support. The rest of the balance will come from tax credits, maternity allowance, maternity pay, sick pay and housing benefits, which are all claimed by working people. The strivers and battlers whom the Prime Minister promised to defend at his party conference will pay the price for the Government&#8217;s failure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/6">I hope we will not have any nonsense from the Minister about how all that will be offset by the rise in the personal allowance. Already, &#163;14 billion has been taken out of tax credits, and yesterday&#8217;s Budget steals another &#163;5 billion from tax credits by 2016-17. The universal credit we have heard so much about&#8212;if it ever happens&#8212;has been hacked into before it has even started. The price will be paid by 6,000 families in the Minister&#8217;s constituency&#8212;no doubt they are delighted with him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/7">In the welfare uprating Bill, what is the value of the squeeze on working people&#8217;s maternity allowance, statutory sick pay, maternity pay, paternity pay, statutory adoption pay, working tax credit and child tax credit? During Second Reading of the Child Poverty Bill, the Minister said that he had given up being an even-handed academic, because he was</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/8">&#8220;appalled at what was happening in our country to the most vulnerable people&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2009-07-20.625"><i>Official Report</i>, 20 July 2009; Vol. 496, c. 625</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/9">Indeed, he attacked his hon. Friends for standing &#8220;idly by&#8221; and watching child poverty reach record levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/10">Before the autumn statement, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that 400,000 children will be plunged back into poverty by 2015 because of measures already taken. How many more children will fall into poverty as a result of this strivers&#8217; tax? Will the Minister please justify to the House how the Chancellor can press ahead with a &#163;3 billion tax cut for the better-off&#8212;a tax cut of &#163;107,000 for the 8,000 people earning over &#163;1 million&#8212;when 6,000 families in his own constituency will see their tax credits frozen or cut? This Budget has increased the claimant count, put up the cost of failure and now working people will pay the price.</p>

	<p pid="a.1033.0/1">It is not often that Shakespeare springs to mind when I respond to these statements, but the phrase</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/2">&#8220;full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/3">springs to mind&#8212;I missed out the earlier bit of the quote about a tale told by an idiot, out of respect for the right hon. Gentleman. We get a lot of fury and sound, but when it comes to the crunch, he abstains. He described the measures as a disaster, but it was not clear whether that means he will vote against them&#8212;answer came there none. If the measures are a disaster, surely he can say he will vote against them, but of course he does not. He sounds sympathetic and angry, but when it comes to the crunch and there is a vote, he disappears and is not to be seen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman asked about the crucial issue of employment, but he does not seem to realise that the number of people in work is at a record level and will rise every year of this Parliament. That is the record of the coalition. He asked about strivers and somehow wanted to waft away the large increase in personal tax allowances. I am afraid, however, that I will not let him waft away a large commitment to Britain&#8217;s strivers. This April, the personal tax alliance</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/5">will rise by a record amount&#8212;&#163;1,300. That is worth &#163;5 a week to the hard-working families he claims to support&#8212;far more than any indexation impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/6">The right hon. Gentleman referred to universal credit and used the phrase &#8220;if it happens&#8221;. He may not have noticed that yesterday we published the rates of disregard for universal credit, and on Monday my right hon. Friend the Work and Pensions Secretary will publish further details. This bold welfare reform is on track, on time and under budget, and it will be delivered as we have promised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/7">The right hon. Gentleman asked about three specific areas. When the welfare uprating Bill is published it will be accompanied by a full impact assessment that will deal with the figures he has requested. On child poverty, the Government remain committed to our statutory obligations, and when taken as a whole, our policies will deliver real reductions in child poverty. He will have seen the chart published yesterday on the impact of universal credit, which shows overwhelmingly that those in the poorest deciles benefit most. Universal credit will help us to eat into child poverty. He did not mention the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement yesterday of a multi-billion pound tax relief for investment by British business which will create jobs and reduce child poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/8">Finally, the right hon. Gentleman mentioned taxes on the highest paid. I seem to remember that he was a Treasury Minister. In 13 years of the Labour Government &#8212;if I remember rightly&#8212;the top rate of income tax was never above 40%. He seems to be objecting to the fact that we have a 45% top rate of income tax. If 45% is too low, why was he satisfied with 40% for 13 years?</p>

	<p pid="a.1034.1/1">My hon. Friend is right that the coalition is making it pay to work. We are paying an increase in the state pension that is above inflation and above earnings growth. The figure he gives is right: someone retiring this year on a full state pension will get around &#163;15,000 more over their retirement than they would get under the policies adopted by the previous Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1034.2/1">To paraphrase Shakespeare, the Minister doth protest too much, methinks. He knows that the majority of our children who live in poverty do so in low-paid, working, not shirking, families. Those families are already experiencing serious difficulties in adequately feeding, clothing and, in some instances, even housing their children. In the light of the freeze on benefits, how many more families and children does he expect to be pushed into that&#8212;surely, in the 21st century&#8212;totally unacceptable situation?</p>

	<p pid="a.1034.3/1">I hesitate to trade Shakespearian quotes with the hon. Lady, but to be clear, benefits are not being frozen, they are being increased. She is right on child poverty. The Government have not just stumbled across working poverty, because it was widespread under</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.3/2">the previous Government, but it will be substantially improved by universal credit, which will make work pay in a way that it did not under the previous Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1035.0/1">Will the Minister confirm that average pay has increased by only 10% and out-of-work benefits have increased by 20% in the past five years, and therefore that holding down the rate of increase will help to make the situation fairer for those who go out to work to pay for those benefits?</p>

Surprisingly, all three of those interviewed understood that the cut would affect them and not just people out of work.

The Government tried to pull the wool over their eyes, but they were smart enough to spot that they would be the casualties.</p>

For working people, and particularly those who are working part time and are dependent on housing benefit, the changes to housing benefit uprating are yet another cut in their standard of living. They lost out in the last round of uprating because of the differential tax credits, which were not uprated in line with inflation. The latest changes are another hit on working families.</p>

	<p pid="a.1037.0/1">The focus of the uprating Bill will be on those benefits over which the Secretary of State has discretionary powers, particularly working-age benefits, JSA and ESA. We will also look at tax credits and child benefit. It is our policy to ensure that carer&#8217;s allowance is protected against inflation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1037.1/1">Does the Minister accept that many of those on working-age benefits spend much of their money on food and, in particular, energy, for which the rate of inflation is much higher than CPI? A 1% increase is not the difference between CPI and 1% for these people but is in fact a much greater cut in their living standards.</p>

	<p pid="a.1037.2/1">This issue is raised every year, and every year it is argued that the rate of inflation for people on benefits is always above the prevailing rate of inflation, but in the long term there is no reason to think that that would be the case. We have made provision for the most vulnerable groups to be protected&#8212;those receiving disability benefits and pensioners&#8212;but unless the hon.

The increase in personal allowance will be outweighed by the losses to their tax credits and benefits. Is that correct? Yes or no.</p>

	<p pid="a.1038.3/1">No, it is not correct. The personal tax allowance will rise by just more than &#163;1,300 in April. At a standard rate of 20%, that is approximately &#163;260 a year, or &#163;5 a week, which is more than the impact for the vast majority of households. The hon.

It is crucial to look at our measures as a whole, including tax allowance rises and cuts in petrol duty compared with previous plans, which benefit the working households he is most concerned about.</p>

	<p pid="a.1041.2/3">I thank the Backbench Business Committee warmly for allowing me to have this debate. It was originally due to take place last Thursday, but was postponed because of the need for the Prime Minister to make a statement on the Leveson inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041.2/4">On <phrase class="date" code="1972-08-04">4 August 1972</phrase>, the Sandhurst-educated President of Uganda, General Idi Amin, informed troops he was addressing in Karamoja in east Uganda that he had had a dream in which God had appeared to him and told him that he had to deal very quickly with the problem of the Ugandan Asians. This referred specifically to some 57,000 Ugandan Asians who held British passports. The problem, if it can be called a problem, was that they numbered 1% of the population but controlled approximately 90% of the country&#8217;s economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041.2/5">The response from Idi Amin was brutal and swift. He said that they had 90 days in which to leave the country, and during those 90 days they had to carry red identity cards at all times. He made it absolutely clear that if any of them remained in the country after the stipulated 90 days, they would be rounded up and thrown into concentration camps. Churchill described Uganda as the pearl of Africa, yet, with such a pronouncement, a climate of fear and desperation fell upon the Ugandan Asians. The sense of desperation was eloquently summed up by the late Manubhai Madhvani in his autobiography, &#8220;Tide of Fortune&#8221;, in which he described the atmosphere at the time and his own imprisonment in a military prison from which few people returned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041.2/6">As for the response in Britain, there was clearly a fair amount of hostility, both in Parliament and the country at large. Some of it was based on basic prejudice, but there was also genuine concern in areas with high unemployment, in areas with long waiting lists for social housing and in areas with large immigrant populations already settled, such as Leicester. Leicester city council certainly took no chances, because it took out adverts in Uganda telling people not to come here, especially to Leicester, because they were not welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.1041.2/7">Credit must be given to the Government of the time, led by Edward Heath, who took a courageous decision.</p>

It should be remembered that not all councillors on Leicester city council in the &#8217;70s agreed with the council&#8217;s decision. In fact, the current Mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, as a young councillor, voted against it. It should be said that Leicester today is a much stronger, more confident and more vibrant city because of the contribution of the Ugandan Asians.</p>

	<p pid="a.1042.0/2">Edward Heath rightly took the decision that both morally and legally Britain had an obligation to take in the refugees.

	<p pid="a.1042.2/1">As always, my hon. Friend makes an apt intervention that enlightens the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.2/2">As a consequence of so many countries agreeing to take refugees, Britain ended up with 28,000 people&#8212;28,000 British passport holders who came here frightened, homeless, penniless and with only the clothes on their backs. They arrived at Stansted airport, and some at Heathrow airport, and were met by demonstrators holding placards saying, &#8220;Go home! You&#8217;re not welcome here.&#8221; The fact that they were British passport holders and had no home to go to was by the bye as far as the demonstrators were concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.2/3">Britain hastily set up the Uganda resettlement board, whose job was to give immediate assistance to the refugees, find them homes and jobs and, importantly, ensure they were resettled in the community at large. To start off with, they settled in 16 resettlement centres scattered throughout the country&#8212;former military bases that were mostly bleak and isolated. But this was a time when Britain was at its best. Having accepted responsibility for these refugees, voluntary groups, church groups, charity groups and ordinary citizens came out to help them. They showed their warmth, their compassion and their care for their fellow human beings. Many of the indigenous population did not have much themselves, but what little they had they were happy to share with the newcomers, giving them food and shelter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.2/4">Councils throughout the country also responded. In south Wales, Pontardawe rural council offered three council homes, Aylesbury rural district council offered six and Peterborough city council&#8212;I represent part of Peterborough&#8212;helped too: the then leader of the council, Councillor Charles Swift, went to Tonfanau resettlement centre in Wales with local employers and offered 50 council houses, provided the people agreed to take on the jobs offered by those with him. For his efforts, Councillor Swift received hate mail and death threats, and for a while required a police escort to take him to work as a railway driver.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.2/5">This was also a time when individuals opened their doors. Some had only one room spare in their house and took in one individual, but others had more space and took in whole families. This was the British character at its best&#8212;but there was a little humour as well. There was the incident of two refugees in a resettlement centre being quite miserable, but suddenly finding that in Britain the shops closed at 5 o&#8217;clock and during the weekends. They smiled, and one said to the other, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to be rich.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.2/6">Very soon the refugees moved from the resettlement centres into the mainstream community. Rather than seeing the expulsion as life-destroying, they looked at it as a setback. They picked themselves up and started all over again. They took whatever jobs were available, worked long hours, made a success of their jobs and their lives and built a better future for their families; and now, many of those people employ hundreds and thousands of our fellow citizens. One such example is Mr Shabbir Damani in Peterborough, who came here penniless but now has nine pharmacies employing 100 full-time staff and another 100 or so on an ad hoc basis. There are many other such examples.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.2/7">There were successes not only in business but in the professions, the military, the police, politics, media and entertainment, charities, sport and so on. There is also the case of Dr Mumtaz Kassam, who was expelled at the age of 16 and went to a resettlement centre in Leamington Spa, but ended up being, until recently, deputy high commissioner for Uganda serving in Britain&#8212;serving the country that had once expelled her as a teenager. The precise contribution made by the Ugandan Asians is difficult to quantify in economic terms, but it is generally felt that the south Asian community&#8212;or those with origins there but who are now settled in Britain&#8212;number 2.5% of the population, but are responsible for 10% of our national output.</p>

	<p pid="a.1043.0/1">I was a student when Edward Heath and the Government of the day bravely decided to respond positively. If ever there was an example of how a policy can help people in their hour of need and understand that foreigners&#8212;although there was a strong British link&#8212;can be an asset not a disadvantage, this is it. We would do well to continue to learn that lesson, as we address the inevitable plight of other people who might look to us for help when, through no fault of their own, their Governments turn on them as minorities and oppress them, as the Amin Government did to the Ugandan Asians.</p>

	<p pid="a.1043.1/1">My right hon. Friend makes a valid point. The Ugandan Asian community is a case study of a minority group who were persecuted, came here but did not seek to rely on the state, instead picking themselves up and becoming self-reliant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.1/2">Many, many success stories are recorded in the media, but we must not forget that not all those 28,000 people became millionaires: many simply got on with their everyday lives, in whatever trade or job they had, and became model citizens in their own way, doing their bit for the greater good of the country as a whole. It is important to record that. There can be no doubt that</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.1/3">the community as a whole has punched above its weight in Britain&#8212;it has done more than its fair share for mainstream Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.1/4">I am reminded of the Parsee community, who were persecuted in Persia&#8212;now Iran&#8212;more than 1,000 years ago: because of their faith, Zoroastrianism, they had to leave Persia. They left in their ships and went to the shores of the state of Gujarat in India. The leader of the Parsees sent an emissary to the Maharajah of the state of Gujarat to say, &#8220;We have been persecuted and we ask that you give us refuge in your country.&#8221; The Maharajah sent the emissary back, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I cannot take you and your people. My own land is too populated, and, besides, you have a different religion and culture. But I will give you this shipload of provisions: food, water, milk, honey&#8212;anything you need to take with you to another place where you might find a home.&#8221; The leader of the Parsees took a cup of milk from the provisions that were sent and some sugar. He put the teaspoon of sugar in the milk, stirred it around, sent for the emissary and said, &#8220;Tell the Maharajah of the state: &#8216;In the same way as the sugar has blended and integrated with the milk, so too, if you give my people refuge in your country, will we integrate.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.1/5">The Parsees were allowed to stay in the state of Gujarat, and they stuck to their word. They became model citizens and are leaders in various aspects of Indian life&#8212;the military, academia, business, entertainment, and so on. One such individual is Ratan Tata, of the Tata group. Not only does he employ thousands of people in India, but the Tata group employs more than 50,000 people in Britain, including more than 700 in my constituency, one of the group&#8217;s companies being Diligenta Ltd. The position was summed up eloquently by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister when I asked him a question recently in Prime Minister&#8217;s questions. Referring to the Ugandan Asians, he said that they had made a</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.1/6">&#8220;fantastic contribution to our national life.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-11-28.224"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 November 2012; Vol. 554, c. 224</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.1/7">The Ugandan Asians who have settled here in the past 40 years have truly settled and truly integrated, becoming part of the fabric of our nation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1044.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" speakername="Fiona Mactaggart" colnum="1044"  time="012:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0002.htm#12120640001244">
	<p pid="a.1044.0/1">I am proud to have supported the request for this debate in a meeting of the Backbench Business Committee. It is an important debate, but I slightly regret its title on the Order Paper, which should refer to the &#8220;Anniversary of the expulsion of British nationals of Asian origin from Uganda&#8221;, as it was only because this group of people shared a passport with other British citizens who were born in Britain that they were accepted here when they sought entry to the UK after expulsion from Uganda.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/2">Permission to enter was not given easily. I have talked to some of those who were desperately queuing outside the British high commission, panicking and in fear of Amin&#8217;s henchmen. They reminded me that it was not until Canada decided to admit 6,000 refugees and Amin started rounding up white Britons that Edward Heath agreed to act. Indeed, Himat Lakhani, whose family were expelled and who himself helped to welcome people here, tells me that the Canadians handed out water and provided them with chairs to sit on. He suggested that</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/3">they managed to encourage the cream of those who fled Uganda to go to Canada as a result of that positive treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/4">A few years before, in a similar process of Africanisation, British people of Asian descent were being squeezed out of Kenya. That led to one of the most shameful acts of a Labour Government, agreed to by this House: the hasty passage of the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968, which created a racial divide in UK citizenship between those who had an ancestor born in Britain and other family members who were citizens of the UK and colonies. My predecessor as MP for Slough opposed that Act. I praise her and other rebels who joined her in opposing it, one of whom is still a Member, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40627" name="David Winnick">the Member for Walsall North (Mr Winnick)</phrase>. I would like to put on record my praise for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/5">Following the 1968 Act, the Government announced the creation of the special quota voucher scheme to admit a small number of British national heads of household who were under pressure to leave Kenya, and later Uganda. When the Uganda expulsion took place, the scheme was insufficient, but it continued for years and led the European Commission of Human Rights to find the UK guilty of &#8220;inhuman and degrading treatment&#8221;. The scheme discriminated against women who were not heads of households but who held UK and colonies citizenship. The waiting time for the issue of quota vouchers in India reached eight years in the mid-1980s&#8212;I remember that because I was trying to help people in the queue. Of course, Amin&#8217;s action meant that the quota voucher system could not cope. Praise is due to Ted Heath for ignoring those such as Enoch Powell and the dockers who argued that we did not have a responsibility to those people. He recognised that we did.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/6">The refugees came here facing cold weather, dismal conditions in the ex-military camps to which they were sent and a nation determined to keep them out of places where they knew people and had relatives, as we have heard. Leicester council even took out newspaper advertisements trying to keep them away. It is interesting to speak to people who were part of that. They tell of the fear they felt in Uganda and of how they arrived with nothing but the clothes on their backs, which were inadequate for British weather. They were fed ham sandwiches in those Royal Air Force camps, even if they were Muslims. They had to share beds. It was often not the warm welcome that we sometimes like to remind ourselves of, although there were individual families who provided the warmest of welcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/7">Himat, along with Mary Dines, formed the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants&#8212;for which I later had the privilege of working&#8212;and set up a co-ordinating committee to support those who wanted to go to the &#8220;red areas&#8221; that the Government were trying to keep them out of. He became a social worker in Southwark. In that role he dealt with 30 families who were the last to leave the camps&#8212;those with a disabled member or some other substantial disadvantage. He told me last night that nearly every one of those 30 families, welcomed into a council house, now owns their own home; so this is a story of success, but also one with some lessons for us in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/8">The first thing we should do is celebrate those such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase>, whose ancestry is from the Uganda Asian community, together with other hon. Members, including</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40664" name="Priti Patel">the hon. Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase> and Shriti Vadera&#8212;the right hon. Baroness Vadera in the other place, who was formerly a Minister. Those people have all contributed enormously to our civic, economic and general life in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/10">While celebrating those achievements, however, we should not forget that the history of our legislation and our rules has not always been one to be celebrated. Just months after we had accepted the Ugandan Asians, in February 1973, this House debated new immigration rules that further downgraded the citizenship of that community. British citizens were given a lower level of priority than Commonwealth citizens who had a grandparental link to the United Kingdom. The creation of that racial divide has been a slur on our immigration policy for years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/11">The history of this process contains lessons for us as legislators and for Ministers. I was in the House in March 2002 when, in reply to a question from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40061" name="John Mann">the Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann)</phrase>, a Home Office Minister announced, without any consultation whatever, the abolition of the special quota voucher scheme, saying that it had become irrelevant and was no longer necessary. That sent out an important signal. The people concerned held British overseas citizenship passports, and we continued to have an obligation to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/12">It is no accident that one of the first actions that Hitler took against the Jews was to remove their citizenship. Citizenship is key to creating a person&#8217;s identity. By excluding people, a state can entrench social exclusion. I know that that Labour Minister was acting innocently on the basis of bogus briefing by civil servants, but we as Members of Parliament need to stand against that kind of injustice. I was glad that, because I knew the history and had been involved in campaigning for so long, I was able to brief the then Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40527" name="David Blunkett">the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr Blunkett)</phrase>, and, within a month, ask him a question to which he responded that he agreed in principle to look again at the matter. By July of that year, the next Minister of State at the Home Office was able to announce that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/13">&#8220;British Overseas Citizens who currently do not hold, and have never given up another nationality will be given an entitlement to register as British citizens.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2002-07-04.525"><i>Official Report</i>, 4 July 2002; Vol. 371, c. 525W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/14">The Home Secretary described the people concerned as having</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/15">&#8220;a deep commitment to this country and a heritage linked with it.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2002-04-24.354"><i>Official Report</i>, 24 April 2002; Vol. 384, c. 354</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/16">He was quite right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/17">We are today recognising the fantastic contribution that these Britons&#8212;and let us call them that&#8212;have made to the country of their citizenship. The fact that they have done so well is largely due to their commitment to education. I represent a racially diverse town, and I know that all sorts of migrants bring energy, courage and a commitment to learning. Anyone who starts a new life and builds up their family thousands of miles away from the place where they were born and brought up has to have the qualities of courage and imagination. One of the reasons why the United Kingdom is a vibrant and dynamic economic and cultural leader, as well as an exciting place to live, is the contribution of those and other migrant communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/18">We also need to use this debate as an opportunity to remind Ministers to treat advice with scepticism. The same civil servants who had told that Home Office Minister that the special quota voucher scheme was irrelevant and no longer necessary were, within a month or two, briefing the Home Secretary that if the change that I was proposing were to be adopted, hundreds of thousands of people would pour into Britain. They did not do so. Both those bits of advice were, frankly, spurious.</p>
	<p pid="a.1044.0/19">There is another lesson for us. The moral panic that led to the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968 and to places such as Leicester saying &#8220;We&#8217;re full up; stay away&#8221; is very similar to some of the things that we hear today about asylum seekers, refugees and immigrants. We need to show the courage that was shown by Sir Peter Soulsby, Joan Lestor and others. We need to say, &#8220;We are not going to go down that road. We are not going to be moved by the likes of the <i>Daily Mail</i> to say that this is a problem to be opposed.&#8221; We must stand up for what is right, and for matters of principle. We must resist the siren calls of hatred. We must tell people that Britain is a successful country because it is a tolerant country and because we have so many different races and traditions that are able to contribute so well to our success and our future.</p>

	<p pid="a.1047.0/1">It is an honour to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase>. I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase> on securing the debate, which celebrates all that is good about Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/2">I grew up in Wembley, and I well remember being at school in the autumn of 1972 when some very young, bewildered and bedraggled individuals suddenly arrived. They did not talk about what had happened to them. They were dressed in second-hand clothes. They spoke brilliant English. Indeed, their English was far better than that of most of the people already at the school. They had clearly had a great education when they arrived, but they did not say much about their experiences. However, as the autumn turned into winter, they found themselves in rather a different environment from the one they had known before.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/3">Those people changed our neighbourhood. We had always had a multi-racial community in Wembley, but it had consisted mostly of what we would now call white UK citizens and West Indians. To that melting pot was added a new group of people. They brought with them wonderful exotic food that none of us had ever experienced before. We became friends with them, but when we visited their houses, we found that they were very different from ours. Every room was used as a bedroom: the kitchen, the dining room, even the bathroom. They lived in a very different environment from that of the rest of us who lived in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/4">It was difficult for many of those families to combat the prejudice that they encountered on a daily basis. We should remember the hatred that was shown towards those people who had arrived in this country, through no fault of their own, wanting a much better life. When I think back to conversations that I had with people</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/5">who are now family friends, I realise what they went through. They did not talk about it at the time. They also did not talk about their background in Uganda, which we should remember was a British colony between 1894 and 1962, when it was given its independence by a Conservative Government. It was then set up and run as a modern, democratic country. The people we now call Ugandan Asians controlled 90% of the business in Uganda at the time. They were driving the economy of the country forward and making commerce a reality for a whole spectrum of people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/6">Then, sadly, Idi Amin came to power. We should remember what kind of person he was. He called those people who were bringing prosperity to Uganda &#8220;bloodsuckers&#8221;. He labelled them &#8220;dukawallahs&#8221;, casting a deliberate slur on people who were of a slightly different ethnic origin. He encouraged the troops to engage in theft and physical assault on the people who were running the country&#8217;s commerce. He encouraged them to use sexual violence, particularly against women, with impunity, and the people who did this were never punished. He then pronounced, as my hon. Friend the Member for North West Cambridgeshire mentioned, that he was going to expel every single Asian who held a British passport.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/7">After the expulsion, all those businesses were handed over to Idi Amin&#8217;s supporters. It is interesting to note that the economy went to rack and ruin as a result of his deliberate decision to force the people who were generating the economy out of that country. Of the people expelled, Britain took around 27,200 citizens arriving in this country; 6,000 went to Canada; only 4,500 ended up in India; and 2,500 went to Kenya to continue their lives in east Africa. Some 5,655 firms in Uganda, along with ranches, farms and agricultural estates, were all reallocated&#8212;taken from the people who owned them and ran them for the benefit of the local economy. They were reallocated on an ad hoc basis to the people who had forced them out. Cars, homes, household goods, clothes and worldly possessions were all just passed over.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/8">Let us imagine the scenario of what happened to those poor people, and then what happened here. We have already heard that in this very Chamber people said, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want them here.&#8221; Councils up and down the country said &#8220;We don&#8217;t want them here.&#8221; The British dockers and the trade unions tried to stop people who were British citizens from coming here. If the people who did that are still alive, they should apologise for their hatred towards those British people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/9">It would have been natural for many of the people arriving to feel sorry for themselves and to think, &#8220;Our life has ended; what are we in now?&#8221; Their reaction, however, was not to rely on the state. They needed some help, of course, but they did not rely on the state. They had existed in Uganda by their own commerce and their own activities, so they set about starting their own businesses in corner shops, seeing the opportunities that Britain offered. They set about employing people, getting loans from the banks where they could, and setting up new industries&#8212;and they thrived. After all, these people who arrived some 40 years ago have at their heart the very British view of wanting to work for a living and not rely on the state. They believed in the extended</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/10">family looking after one another, and looking after the elderly and the young ones&#8212;encapsulating everything that is good about Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/11">Forty years on, we are now seeing the third or possibly fourth generation of individuals who came to this country. They are leaders in business and commerce, they are great employers, and they generate valuable resources for this country. They have brought other things, too. We have in this country some of the greatest temples outside India, and they have been built by the people who were expelled from Uganda and other parts of east Africa. I am proud to be associated with many of those temples, and encourage people to celebrate their religion. Of course, these are often the people who most believe in law and order. There are fewer Hindus in our prisons than people of any other religion. They believe in law and order, they obey this country&#8217;s rules and they swear allegiance to the Queen and everything we hold dear.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/12">As for education, these families all wanted better for their children, and it is unusual to find such a family that does not have within its ranks a doctor, dentist, lawyer, accountant or other professional. I well remember that what they brought to my school and my area was their cultural roots and their celebrations of their culture. They still celebrate those things today&#8212;and quite rightly, too. They also assisted our sporting legacy. Indeed, at my school, our hockey team dramatically improved when they arrived, as did the cricket team. It is true that we can still celebrate that contribution today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.0/13">In my constituency today, 40% of the residents have a heritage stemming from Gujarat, from east Africa or from Uganda in particular. In this melting pot of an area in Harrow, people live in peace and harmony. They celebrate their religion; they celebrate their culture; they celebrate their background. The people who came here have generated business, commerce and wealth for this country and for their families, and they have established a heritage here, which we celebrate. Their belief in family values and law and order is an example to us all. I think we can truly say that Uganda&#8217;s loss was Britain&#8217;s gain.</p>

I apologise to him and other Members as I shall shortly have to leave the Chamber to attend the fisheries debate in Westminster Hall. I am pleased that, after last week&#8217;s postponement, we have found time to mark the 40th anniversary in today&#8217;s debate. We should not forget what happened in Uganda in the early 1970s, especially in a world where protection of human rights remains such a pressing challenge.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049.0/2">Today&#8217;s debate provides me with an opportunity to pay tribute to a constituent and friend of mine, Vinay Ruparelia, who came to Scotland as a young man, having been expelled from Uganda along with thousands of other Ugandan Asians. Just a few weeks ago, Vinay retired from a successful pharmacy business that he had run with his wife Teresa in Banff and Portsoy for the last 34 years. The public service he has provided and the jobs he has created in the local community over the years are, in themselves, no small achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049.0/3">It is fair to say that running the business has sometimes seemed like a sideline compared to Vinay&#8217;s efforts on behalf of the community of which he became a part. Vinay is a very well kent face around the north-east of Scotland because of his long-standing involvement in a number of local and international charities. As a former president of the Banff rotary club, which celebrated its 60th anniversary this year, Vinay has played an important role in a range of educational and health initiatives at home and overseas. He is currently a director of Books Abroad, a local charity that sends quality second-hand books to schools overseas. Having visited schools in parts of Africa where there is only one textbook for 200 children, I know the difference that that can make to the quality of education and the quality of life for children in developing countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049.0/4">Similarly, when earthquakes and other humanitarian disasters strike anywhere in the world, Vinay&#8217;s shop has always been a place where donations could be made for global relief efforts. On more than one occasion, I have found him making up kits of essential supplies from his own stockroom.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049.0/5">Vinay has also given up his time very generously to causes much closer to home, and served as chair of the board of Turning Point Scotland, which is a national charity that supports some of the people in our society with the most complex needs, notably those with significant learning disabilities and those recovering from drug and alcohol addictions. Vinay brought the same energy, compassion and entrepreneurial flair to Turning Point that he brought to his business activities. He also exhibited another characteristic talent at getting other people involved. In fact, prior to my election here, he persuaded me to get involved on Turning Point&#8217;s board.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049.0/6">When we read about asylum seekers and refugees in the press, we often get the impression that the generosity is one way, and that it is all ours, but exceptional citizens such as Vinay and so many others&#8212;some of whom we have heard about this afternoon&#8212;have given far more to our society than they have ever received from it. Vinay was the first person I ever knew who had been a refugee. Undoubtedly, as a youngster, learning the story of how he had ended up in north-east Scotland and how thousands of people like him were forced to leave their homes and livelihoods, coloured my understanding of why we have a duty to protect those who seek asylum and why the international conventions that protect human rights are so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1049.0/7">Above all, today&#8217;s debate is a salutary reminder of the sorts of the circumstances that give rise to people becoming refugees and asylum seekers, and it brings home to me why it is so important that we continue to honour our obligations towards refugees and asylum seekers under international law. Ugandan Asians faced unimaginable circumstances with great resilience and courage, so it is fitting that we have had an opportunity to pay tribute to them today.</p>

	<p pid="a.1051.0/1">I am happy to do that, Mr Deputy Speaker. I shall make just a few short comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1051.0/2">First, let me thank our hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase> for his timely and persistent attempts to secure the debate. He naturally wanted to ensure that it took take place, but the rest of us are happy to associate ourselves with his wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.1051.0/3">Although she has left the Chamber, I also want to pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase>. She worked for the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants for a long time, and did a very reputable and important job in that organisation. Her continuing commitment to the cause of immigrants to this country, and to others who have not come here but may wish to do so&#8212;and have a claim to do so&#8212;deserves to be put on record. She paid tribute to others, and I think that she deserves a tribute herself.</p>
	<p pid="a.1051.0/4">The backdrop to today&#8217;s debate is the legislation of the 1960s, which was not our country&#8217;s most glorious hour, and the mercifully much better response to that terrible &#8220;90 days&#8221; threat to an entire community, the entrepreneurial heartbeat of Uganda, in 1972. Thank God we responded as we did and other countries in the Commonwealth and elsewhere responded as they did, and thank God there were enlightened local authorities in Britain which, as was pointed out by the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire, were positive in their response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1051.0/5">It was not easy for the people who came here in 1972. The weather, as I recall, was grim, and, as we have been reminded, conditions were often grim as well. Those people had a very difficult start. Not only did they come with, literally, the clothes that they could take from their homes and the suitcases that they could pack&#8212;often with no finances, and with young children in tow&#8212;but they then went into pretty grim accommodation, which we provided in various parts of the country at short notice. The fact that their conditions were made much better was due solely to the wonderful volunteering spirit of members of the community who offered their help, as well as the work of those for whom it was a statutory duty.</p>

	<p pid="a.1051.1/1">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-15">15 August 2005</phrase> an article was published by Martin Wainwright, describing how our former colleague Richard Wainwright, who was Member of Parliament for Colne Valley, took in one of these families. That description gives life to what Members are saying today.</p>

	<p pid="a.1051.2/1">I knew that, and, as my hon. Friend would expect, I know Martin Wainwright well: he is Richard Wainwright&#8217;s son. Many others did the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.1051.2/2">My constituency has a proud association with Uganda, because King Freddie of Buganda settled there and made it his home, thanks to the generosity of, in particular, the Carr-Gomm family. It was Richard Carr-Gomm, a former Liberal MP for Rotherhithe, who set up the Carr-Gomm Society and the Abbeyfield Society. In what was, in those days, a very white Bermondsey, hospitality and recognition were given to King Freddie and his family, and that spirit has continued through the ages. What happened then changed the cultural</p>
	<p pid="a.1051.2/3">mood of a community, transforming white docklands London into the wonderfully multicultural community that we have now.</p>

	<p pid="a.1052.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase> on raising this important issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.0/2">I was one of the constituents of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> and worked in his constituency, and, as he may well know, I was an immigrant myself. Many immigrants come to this country, and it should be proud of attracting people who will contribute to society, whether they are refugees or not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1052.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" speakername="Simon Hughes" colnum="1052"  time="013:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0002.htm#12120640001253">
	<p pid="a.1052.1/1">My hon. Friend was the chair of the local Conservative party, if I am not mistaken. Little did I imagine in those days, when Tory candidates stood against me and got 2%, 3%, 4% or 5% of the vote, that I would end up in a coalition Government with him. &#8220;Never rule anything out&#8221; should be a political adage for us always to follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/2">I entirely associate myself with what my hon. Friend has said. I represent very few east African Asian constituents, for no reason other than the fact that they have not settled principally in Southwark, although a significant number run shops and businesses. However, in London as a whole and more widely, the contribution made to, in particular, education, the professions and business in Britain by not just Ugandan Asians but east African Asians in general has been phenomenal. We would not be the successful country that we are now, at home and abroad, were it not for that contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/3">Let me give a microcosmic example. When I was first elected, I observed that the undergraduates entering the medical and dental schools at Guy&#8217;s hospital were predominantly white men whose dads and mums, mainly dads, had been doctors before them. The undergraduates who are starting courses this year at Guy&#8217;s and Tommy&#8217;s medical and dental school, which is part of King&#8217;s college, are predominantly women, and a significant number have Asian backgrounds. Their families are east African Asians, or people from elsewhere in Asia, whose professional parents may have been driven out of countries such as Uganda, or may have left in adverse circumstances. It is a phenomenal transformation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/4">We have had other glorious days. For instance, we eventually behaved better than we might have towards the Hong Kong Chinese who were threatened at the end of Britain&#8217;s time in charge of Hong Kong. However, the less glorious days are not over yet. There are still some legacy groups whom we must try to help and support. My noble Friend Lord Avebury and I have been trying to assist a small group of Malay Chinese who have British overseas citizens&#8217; passports but are still in limbo. I hope that the Minister will ensure that Home Office Ministers are reminded that their future has not been sorted out between our Government and the Government of Malaysia. I do not blame our Government, but the situation must be resolved, because that group of people are completely stuck. We have a particular responsibility for those who come from other Commonwealth realms and from British overseas territories.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/5">The hon. Member for Slough and my hon. Friend the Member for North West Cambridgeshire issued a plea to the House, urging us to remember that we in this</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/6">country have an obligation to stand up for people who come here seeking asylum honestly and properly. We are a rich country: we are one of the richest countries in the world, even during the current period of economic difficulty. We are also one of the most diverse, multicultural and multifaith countries in the world. We co-wrote documents such as the European convention on human rights and the United Nations declaration of civil and political rights. If we cannot, in their moment of need, be here for people who are fleeing from persecution&#8212;either as individuals or as a group&#8212;because of their colour, faith, background, sexuality or gender, we cannot expect others to do the same in the world as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="a.1052.1/7">We must never allow the unintelligent and prejudiced media to confuse asylum seekers with immigrants in general. Those are separate issues, and subjects for separate debates. Of course we need an immigration policy, and of course we need to control the number of people who come here. We cannot have an &#8220;open border&#8221; policy. However, we must also have a sane, civilised and respectable policy in relation to asylum seekers. We must honour our obligations. We must try to ensure that the rest of the world knows that we will not close the door to people in their time of need and say no. We will say yes, and we will learn the good lessons of the wonderful experience of making the right decision 40 years ago, to the great benefit of Britain and those families in particular, and to the benefit of the wider world.</p>

	<p pid="a.1053.0/1">It is a huge pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/2">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase> on securing the debate, and on having assiduously visited many Members to persuade them to support it. I also pay tribute to the co-ordination between him and another Ugandan Asian&#8217;s son who is in the House of Lords, Lord Popat of Harrow. I understand that at 2.30 pm today the other place will also debate these important issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/3">We should acknowledge that, although she was not born in Uganda, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40664" name="Priti Patel">the hon. Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase> is the product of Ugandan Asian parents. The House of Commons has its fair share of representation of those whose families came from Uganda and settled in this country, although the other House has probably done slightly better in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/4">My speech has two purposes: to recognise the perseverance and hard work of the Ugandan Asians who came to live in my constituency, and to celebrate the next generation. As we have heard, in 1972 28,000 Ugandan Asians came to Britain, and 10,000&#8212;a third of them&#8212;settled in Leicester. Let me start by saying the Ugandan Asian community has undoubtedly transformed the city of Leicester. In the early 1970s, Leicester was facing an economic crisis. The shrinking of the manufacturing sector, and in particular the hosiery industry, presented a real challenge to the city, but the Ugandan Asians came and rebuilt Leicester. They have transformed the city, and also the country. It has become fashionable to denigrate and criticise immigrants, but the same media outlets that used to say immigrants have come here to live off state benefits now celebrate their achievements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/5">In order to understand Leicester&#8217;s transformation, we must understand the journey of the Ugandan Asians. As the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire said, the contribution of the Ugandan Asians to Africa was profound. They transformed, and helped shape, Uganda. As well as holding the great festivals that we now also celebrate here, in a real sense they were the economic heart of Uganda&#8212;the doctors, the teachers, the business people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/6">My constituent, Nisha Popat, was born in Jinja, Uganda. Her father, Manu Lakhani, observed:</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/7">&#8220;Life in Uganda, I would say, was really, really wonderful because there was no tension. People were all friendly.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/8">He added that the Ugandan Asians made a great contribution to the country. My wife was born in east Africa, and she, too, has told me about how the east African Asians helped that continent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/9">We have heard about what Idi Amin did. The Ugandan Asians had to leave their homes and businesses&#8212;their money, friends and properties. That is a matter of record. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> described them queuing up, emotionally scarred by the experience of having to get their passports and come here.</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/10">Many arrived in Leicester with just a single bag, and they faced enormous hostility. Marches through Leicester were organised by the National Front, whose membership rocketed. We have also heard about what representatives on Leicester city council said, with some honourable exceptions, including Sir Peter Soulsby. An advertisement was placed&#8212;in the <i>Uganda</i> <i>Argu</i> <i>s</i>, not the <i>Leicester Mercury</i>&#8212;telling people not to come:</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/11">&#8220;In your own interests and those of your family you should not come to Leicester.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1053.0/12">They came anyway, and soon Leicester will be the first city in Europe with a majority ethnic population. That is a source of great civic pride, which I and my parliamentary colleagues from Leicester, my hon. Friends the Members for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth) and for Leicester West (Liz Kendall), share.</p>

	<p pid="a.1054.0/1">Although we in Leicester have, of course, been remembering this 40th anniversary over recent weeks, we have also been remembering my right hon. Friend&#8217;s 25 years as a Leicester Member of Parliament&#8212;and we all look forward to his next 25 years. Does he agree that today Leicester is a tremendously harmonious city, and that that is in large part thanks to the great work done by the city council over many years, and also to the mosques, gurdwaras, temples and churches, as well as to all the other organisations such as the Federation of Muslim Organisations and the Gujarat Hindu Association? They have all worked very hard on this matter and continue to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1054.1/1">As usual, my hon. Friend is absolutely right, and he has given a name-check to some of the more prominent organisations, although there are many others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/2">The new arrivals settled in Highfields, Spinney Hill and Belgrave in my constituency, and in Rushey Mead. Ila Radia described her situation, as did Jitubhen Radia, who remembered of her arrival:</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/3">&#8220;It was very cold as we had no heating. I used to go to bed with my coat on.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/4">Aruna Badiani commented that</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/5">&#8220;my parents used to really suffer, because we struggled in the cold weather, with no central heating&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/6">and they were very isolated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/7">The new arrivals worked for companies including British United Shoe Machinery, Corah, Imperial Typewriters, GE Lighting, and Walkers Crisps. Bala Thakrar recalls her first days at school in England:</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/8">&#8220;I suppose going into the school was frightening. I went to a school where there weren&#8217;t many other Asian or African children so that for me was the biggest shock&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/9">because all the children seemed so different. A teacher at the time, Mrs Gordon, said about the enthusiastic Ugandan Asian children:</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/10">&#8220;Sometimes a bit too keen, you know; they all wanted to be brain surgeons and doctors, but you got used to that.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/11">At that stage, of course, none of them wanted to be what the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire became: a Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/12">The new arrivals worked hard. They rebuilt their lives and held on to their values and culture. They were determined to create a new life for themselves, and made a truly significant impact on Leicester&#8217;s economy. One estimate suggests that the 10,000 who came to Leicester have created 30,000 jobs in the city. Those people included Bhagwanji Lakhani who set up the world-famous Bobby&#8217;s restaurant in my constituency, and Jayanti Chandarana, who bought his first petrol station in the 1970s.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/13">Today the Ugandan Asian community is a part of the Leicester landscape. To see that we just have to walk down the Belgrave road in my constituency. I know <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" name="Bob Blackman">the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase> loves his constituency and area as much as I love mine, but if there were a competition, the Belgrave road would probably beat the Ealing road. On the Belgrave road is our &#8220;golden mile&#8221; as it is popularly known, because it boasts a range of shops and enterprises run by Ugandan Asians. I know that today a television screen has been set up in the Belgrave neighbourhood centre, and the community has gathered to watch this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/14">There are businesses such as Ram Jewellers and Kampala Jewellers and the great sari shop, Sheetals, as well as restaurants and caterers such as Mirch Masala, Sanjay Foods and Sharmilee. Even my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester South is granted a visa to enter Leicester East to eat at these establishments. He might also choose to pop into the shop of the world-famous photographer, Maz Mashru, who has won the Kodak gold award for his amazing pictures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/15">Their contribution has not gone unrecognised by a grateful city. The local newspaper, the <i>Leicester Mercury</i>, dedicated pages to the achievements of the Ugandan Asians who came here. An exhibition was staged at the New Walk museum to celebrate their accomplishments. Such was its success that it will have a permanent home in the spring at the Newarke Houses museum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/16">We have heard from Members representing Slough, Harrow, Southwark and even Banff and Buchan, and we will hear later from a Member representing Wolverhampton. That illustrates that the Ugandan Asians</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/17">have gone all over the country. I am particularly focused on the next generation, however. Those of us who came here as first-generation immigrants&#8212;I came here at the age of nine, and from Yemen, not east Africa&#8212;have opened the doors. The next generation will be the golden generation, because of the contribution they can make not as first-generation immigrants, but as equal citizens of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/18">That is true of the Ugandan Asians, and also of all the other communities who come here. Questions are nowadays asked about whether multiculturalism is a fad of the past. It is, in fact, very important. It is what won us the Olympics. Team GB was a mirror of Britain. Athletes from different backgrounds won us gold medals, and silvers and bronzes, because of the work they have done as equal citizens.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/19">I have great ambitions and hopes for the next generation of Ugandan Asians. They have huge ambition themselves, and great talent and amazing capabilities. Perhaps one day a Ugandan Asian will be speaking not from the Back Benches, but from the Treasury Bench, winding up for the Government in important debates such as this one. I hope I am a Member long enough to see that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1054.1/20">I thank the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire for enabling us to debate this important subject, and I say to the Ugandan Asians, both in the Belgrave neighbourhood centre in Leicester and throughout the country, who are watching our debate, &#8220;The best is yet to come.

	<p pid="a.1056.0/1"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">The right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase> reminds me that I try to end most speeches by saying that we can look with affection to the past, with admiration to the present and with confidence to the future. I am glad that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase> has managed to secure this debate, as I have learned a lot from those who have spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/2">My grandmother took in a Russian after the great war; my parents, when I moved out of my bedroom, took in a Hungarian refugee after the uprising; and my wife and I were delighted to go to an RAF camp in Kent to collect Razia and Roshan Jetha, who came to live with us for a year and a half. We learned a great deal from them, and I was also grateful for the &#163;5 a week they gave us, which helped with the housekeeping.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/3">The key point about the Ugandan resettlement is that within two years the resettlement board had produced its final report and almost none of the evacuees were out of work. We cannot say that all the problems had been solved, but the job had been done. If people look at the record of the Adjournment debate that David Lane, the then MP for Cambridge, had on <phrase class="date" code="1974-07-29">29 July 1974</phrase>, which was responded to by Alex Lyon, they will see those who helped to contribute to that&#8212;the voluntary groups, the Churches and the Women&#8217;s Royal Voluntary Service, among others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/4">Nationality is one of the issues in this debate, which must be seen in the context of the see-saw in Britain between justice and racialism, both of which we have</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/5">had and perhaps still have. J. B. Priestley, during the war, asked us to name our eight great-grandparents. Most of us cannot do that, so we cannot actually know precisely who we are. Dorothy Sayers, in an essay or talk she wrote during the war called &#8220;The Mysterious English&#8221;, which was published in &#8220;Unpopular Opinions&#8221;, one of Victor Gollancz&#8217;s yellow-covered books, tried to explain to people what it was to be English. She said that we were &#8220;a nation&#8221; rather than &#8220;a race&#8221;, but to go into her argument would take up more time than I have available. It is worth remembering that when Idi Amin went mad it was in the context of Kenya and Tanzania doing the same kind of thing as he was doing and when the UK was in the middle of passing a succession of immigration laws in 1962, 1968 and 1971. In 1968, James Callaghan openly said that in these sorts of circumstances, which he would not have foreseen directly, we would take in the people of British nationality. As it happened, Idi Amin wanted to get rid of the 23,000 Asians who had Ugandan nationality as well, so we are not particularly talking about those who had chosen one kind of passport rather than another.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/6">I pay tribute to Sir Charles Cunningham and the resettlement board, because they managed to bring the resources together. They asked for help, they provided it and they brought in the evacuees at &#163;70 a head for each flight. As well as taking the offers from other parts of the world, they provided the basis for letting the Asians from Uganda join in our community in a way that was just regarded as natural by most who met them. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">The right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> referred to King Freddie, and two of my children were at school with King Freddie&#8217;s children or nephews and nieces. It was perfectly normal and natural; although everyone has backgrounds, some happier than others, some grander than others, at that age people accept each other as they are. That is one of the contributions that the Ugandan Asians have made, and the same can be said of the Kenyan Asians and the Tanzanian Asians.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/7">We ought to try once a year to have a debate on inclusiveness. Others might think of it as &#8220;diversity&#8221; but I think it is inclusiveness; it is about how we give people the chance to make a contribution to their own lives, to their communities and to the nation. If we can do that, we can be proud of being on the right side of the see-saw: on the side of British justice rather than racialism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1056.0/8">I end with some words about a man I first knew when he was the vicar of Tulse Hill&#8212;after other jobs, he later became the Archbishop of York. I turn around words that he had once used in my hearing by saying, &#8220;They came, they saw and they stuck to it.&#8221; He put it as &#8220;Veni, vidi, velcro.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.1057.0/1">First, I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase> for securing this debate. As protocol, we refer to those on our Benches as hon. Friends, but I am happy to say that he is a personal friend. Interestingly, just as I am about to speak two other personal friends seem to have joined me. I am taking a bit of risk in speaking without any notes or having preparing for the debate. I am not sure whether they are here to see me fall flat on my face, but I think their interests are benign.</p>
	<p pid="a.1057.0/2">Why am I here? I am of east African descent. My father came to this country from Kenya in 1961. He had less than &#163;5 in his pocket and no idea of where he was going to sleep that night. He took that risk because he wanted to live in a country that had choice, freedom and opportunity. For my father, it was not too bad, but my uncle&#8217;s situation and story were slightly different. In Cusumo we ran a small electrical business and from the mid to late &#8217;60s life was made very uncomfortable for my uncle.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1058.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40670" speakername="Paul Uppal" colnum="1058"  time="013:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0002.htm#12120640001260">
	<p pid="a.1058.1/1">In Kenya. In essence, my uncle left with just the shirt on his back and the opportunity to come to the UK. He followed my father and came here. He was driven by those same principles of wanting to live in a country where he had opportunity, choice and freedom. That story was replicated by many thousands of people, and I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the hon. Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> for raising an issue that has been highlighted so often: in early 1968, in what Andrew Marr described as one of the most shameful periods of British politics, more than 40,000 Kenyan Asians were made stateless. It is important to put things in perspective, and what is so good about these Back-Bench debates is the quality of the debate. There is an attempt to be non-partisan, but it is sometimes important for us to have an honest and cathartic debate to recognise where shortfalls have occurred.</p>
	<p pid="a.1058.1/2">I was born in the UK and went to school here. When I think back to those early days, I recall that often between shutting the front door and getting to school I was told to go home on about half a dozen occasions. I was not sure where home was really. Home for me was a small two up, two down in Smethwick, where eight or 10 of us would sit around of an evening having a meal. What I encountered did not stop when I reached school. I am not going to embellish things and I can assure the House that this next story is a true one. In one of my technical drawing lessons when I was probably about 11 years old, the deputy head master was asking the students what we were going to do that evening and he asked&#8212;I will tone this down&#8212;whether anyone was going out bashing Asian people. I remember my spine getting very stiff. I was attempting to draw a straight line as I said that, but it wobbled as those last few words came out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1058.1/3">This debate, and the way in which it has been conducted, has brought back so many memories, and that is why I wanted to speak in it. I am now the Member for Wolverhampton South West, which was represented by Enoch Powell between 1950 and 1974, so therein lies another story. When Enoch Powell first won the seat in 1950 he had a majority of 691, as did I when I won my seat in 2010. If I feel a compulsion to make a radical speech in 16 years&#8217; time in a Midland hotel, please feel free, my most respected friends, to hold me back and stop me&#8212;although I suspect that is unlikely.</p>
	<p pid="a.1058.1/4">I return to the main point of today&#8217;s debate and what we are, in essence, talking about. I picked up on one sentence from my hon. Friend the Member for North West Cambridgeshire: he said that this period showed Britain at its best. I know that the Minister and the shadow Minister are anxious to speak on this issue, so I will not delay them for too long. However, I think one</p>
	<p pid="a.1058.1/5">thing encapsulates this period of British history more than anything else. I was listening recently to a chaplain from RAF Cosford talking about an experience that he had had. The term &#8220;concentration camp&#8221; has been used today, and he was speaking about his experience when visiting such a camp. I am not sure whether it was Auschwitz-Birkenau, but from the images he saw he was struck by one thing. He said, &#8220;If you have two rooms, one full of light and one full of darkness and you open the door to the one that has light, the light will spread into the darkness.&#8221; In this period of history we can look at the British role and at British politicians as spreading light into a time of darkness. It is important for us to remember that, especially as we take this issue forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1058.1/6">I agree with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>: the best days are ahead of us for the east African Asian community. Its contribution has been phenomenal. It is cathartic for me to stand in this wonderful Chamber and speak about these issues, especially as I have mentioned the history of growing up as a small boy in Smethwick, walking to school and having to face those experiences. I dare say that my father will be watching this speech&#8212;or perhaps even taping it, as even though he is retired he seems to be busier than I am. That is very much the ethos of so many east African Asians. He came here to work and he still does; he embodies the best that is British.</p>
	<p pid="a.1058.1/7">I have a Christian first name and a Sikh surname. I have always tried to live by the ethos of trying to combine the best of my British values with my traditional Indian values. I am not alone in that. All east African Asians who have come to this country&#8212;and many other migrants, if we are honest&#8212;have tried to adopt it. They enrich their host culture and the indigenous communities with which they mix. When we have that combination, we have a formula for success.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1059.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40689" speakername="Seema Malhotra" colnum="1059"  time="013:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0002.htm#12120640001261">
	<p pid="a.1059.0/1">I, too, pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase> for securing the debate. The 40th anniversary of the arrival in Britain of the Asians who were expelled from Uganda is a wonderful occasion that allows us to pay tribute to those who left so much and suffered so much on the way, but who have now contributed so much to Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1059.0/2">I want to add a few words to the moving speeches made by so many hon. Members, including my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40670" name="Paul Uppal">the hon. Member for Wolverhampton South West (Paul Uppal)</phrase>. The range of contributions on and references to places across Uganda shows that the voice of the Ugandan Asians has spread across this country. We have seen their contribution in areas far and wide as well as in constituencies such as mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1059.0/3">I was born in Britain and I am a British Asian. Although my family did not come directly from east Africa, members of my extended family did. They hid so well the suffering and sacrifice they had to make from the next generation that I never knew until I was much older what had happened and how the community had supported itself and stayed strong in times of great</p>
	<p pid="a.1059.0/4">hardship on arrival. I want to mention someone who was very dear to me but who died a year ago, just before my election: Mr Jagpal founded the Vedic Cultural Society, which makes a strong contribution to our community in Hounslow and brings people together in faith as well as in cultural activities. He was a true example of the role of those individuals. They resettled their families and their children at new schools and started new jobs, in which often they had had no experience, simply to make ends meet; and, in the amazing tradition of parents under stress, created a better life for the next generation, ensuring that those who came after did not face the same suffering as they did but went on to play a huge part in their nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1059.0/5">I am incredibly proud of Britain. That time is marked out in our recent British history as a time of great compassion, of great welcome to those from abroad and of when we saw the diverse fabric of Britain at its very best. It absorbed those people within the nation and made Britain the diverse nation it is. We have seen the value of that this year in our winning the Olympics. Indians took part in the opening and closing ceremonies and showed that we have managed as Asians in Britain to become a strong part of the fabric of this country. We maintain links with our separate histories, but do so in a way that makes Britain even stronger in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1059.0/6">I thank my hon. Friend the Member for North West Cambridgeshire for securing the debate and pay tribute to all those in my community who, through businesses, schools and their community contributions, play such a huge part in our public life in Britain.</p>

	<p pid="a.1060.0/1">It is a privilege to speak in this debate from the Front Bench, as what started out as a humanitarian catastrophe has turned into an amazing human success story. This has been a celebratory debate, which we do not often have in this Chamber, and it has united the whole House this afternoon. We have heard a number of very moving speeches, but I want to pay particular tribute, as others have already, to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase> for his tenacity in securing the debate. As we know, it was replaced by the discussion on the Leveson inquiry and I am pleased that he persevered and succeeded in bringing the issue before us this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1060.0/2">We have also heard passionate and heart-warming contributions from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40536" name="Fiona Mactaggart">the Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase>, the hon. Members for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) and for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford), <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40674" name="Peter Bottomley">the hon. Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley)</phrase>, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40689" name="Seema Malhotra">the Member for Feltham and Heston (Seema Malhotra)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40670" name="Paul Uppal">the hon. Member for Wolverhampton South West (Paul Uppal)</phrase>. It is a mark of how far we have come that the hon. Member for Wolverhampton South West represents the seat that was once represented by Enoch Powell.</p>
	<p pid="a.1060.0/3">Despite my youthful appearance, I remember the terrible events of 1972, when General Idi Amin decided to expel the Asian Ugandans after, I think, the British refused to provide financial support. I heard a documentary earlier this year that reported that Idi Amin had</p>
	<p pid="a.1060.0/4">subsequently apologised for that decision&#8212;rather late, it must be said. One of the consequences of that decision was that it was catastrophic for the Ugandan economy. It had a damaging impact on Uganda, and perhaps that was one of the reasons Idi Amin recognised the error of his ways and apologised for his actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1060.0/5">Edward Heath&#8217;s Government tried to negotiate with Idi Amin, but unfortunately did not get anywhere. As we have heard, the Ugandan Asians were told they would be imprisoned in concentration camps if they did not leave the country within 90 days. After the events of the second world war, which were relatively recent history, it was appalling to hear about concentration camps and putting people into them. We were faced with a humanitarian crisis. The Heath Government looked to settle people in other countries but they found that very difficult, as many refused, so they offered the Ugandan Asians the opportunity to come to Britain. It has to be said that that was one of Ted Heath&#8217;s finest hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.1060.0/6">The Ugandan Asians who came to Britain had few, if any, possessions, and many were robbed by the Ugandan authorities. Those immigrants went through a terribly traumatic experience. We have heard that the mass migration was very controversial at the time, and it came just a few years after Enoch Powell&#8217;s infamous &#8220;rivers of blood&#8221; speech. Edward Heath was worried about Enoch Powell and that that speech could increase racial tensions. We know that that led to the introduction of a new immigration Act, whereby the right to British citizenship for Indians in other countries, such as Kenya, was revoked.</p>
	<p pid="a.1060.0/7">On arrival in the UK many Ugandan Asians were bussed to Strandishall in Suffolk and put into temporary accommodation until they could be settled across the country. The migrants subsequently relocated to various parts of the UK, as we have heard today. The legacy of that migration has been extremely positive. Again, we have heard many examples this afternoon. Many of the Ugandan Asians were skilled and educated workers and so were able to integrate into society successfully. It is worth acknowledging that although Leicester city council at the time took out advertisements, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Leicester East pointed out, urging Ugandan Asians not to settle in Leicester, a third of the Ugandan Asians did settle there and have made a huge and positive contribution. Leicester is now an exemplar of how a diverse and cohesive community can form over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1060.0/8">The story of Britain&#8217;s response to the plight of the Ugandan Asians is an illustration of what makes Britain such a great country. It illustrates the sort of actions that make all of us in the Chamber today and, I am sure, the rest of the nation proud to be British.</p>

Member for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart)</phrase> echoed such views and spoke of the contribution of immigrants to many different aspects of life in this country, not least to our vibrant cultural life. She also rightly pointed to lessons to be learned and cited examples of legislation that did not show us at our most tolerant.</p>

He reminded us of the contribution that many of the Ugandan Asians made in sports such as cricket and hockey. Above all, he made it clear, as did the hon. Member for Derby North, that Uganda&#8217;s loss was Britain&#8217;s gain.</p>

	<p pid="a.1062.2/2">This debate is about a celebration of 40 years. Sometimes when new communities arrive, there is a tendency to criticise them and what they do when they first arrive. Is there not a lesson about the way in which we use language when new communities arrive? I am thinking about the east European community, which, over the past eight years since accession, has made such a great contribution to this country, but there are still criticisms</p>
	<p pid="a.1062.2/3">of it. We need to be careful because at the end of the day, the contribution can be seen.</p>

	<p pid="a.1063.0/1">I absolutely agree. A similar point was made earlier by my right hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40670" name="Paul Uppal">The hon. Member for Wolverhampton South West (Paul Uppal)</phrase> described his own family&#8217;s experience coming here, wanting choice, freedom and opportunity, and pointed out that when they got here they used them to full advantage, making, as he described it, a phenomenal contribution. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40689" name="Seema Malhotra">The hon. Member for Feltham and Heston (Seema Malhotra)</phrase> described the ongoing contribution that Ugandan Asians are making in her constituency, and her pride in Britain&#8217;s compassion and the welcome that was given then and which we continue to give to incoming immigrants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/3">Looking back over the past 40 years to those fateful months in 1972, we know that the United Kingdom acted swiftly. Idi Amin announced on <phrase class="date" code="1972-08-04">4 August 1972</phrase> that there was no room in Uganda for British Asians. By <phrase class="date" code="2012-09-18">18 September</phrase> the first 193 British Asians from Uganda arrived at Stansted airport, and in the first year, 1972-73, a total of 38,500 Ugandans Asians came to Britain. Even in that initial period we saw the seeds of the ongoing success of the British Ugandan Asians. By mid-November 1972 more than 1,000 employers had already offered jobs to the newcomers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/4">Many people have been praised today but we should not forget the work of Praful Patel, then secretary of the all-party committee on United Kingdom citizenship and now a key organiser of the 40th anniversary events this year, who, following the expulsion of the Ugandan Asians, became a member of the Uganda resettlement board, which has been mentioned, and was involved at an individual level, helping thousands of families to mend separated and broken lives. There are success stories everywhere. The hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire is one of them, as is my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40664" name="Priti Patel">the Member for Witham (Priti Patel)</phrase>. Lata Patel was the mayor of Brent back in 1996, Yasmin Alibhai-Brown is a well respected journalist and author, Rupal Rajani is a BBC journalist. Mohammed Asif Din played cricket for Warwickshire, and Tarique Ghaffur CBE QPM was an assistant Commissioner at the Met police. There are many others who could be mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/5">Only a day ago I had a letter from a successful British Ugandan Asian who wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/6">&#8220;The lessons learnt show that with compassion, decency and understanding an impoverished community can come to the UK and grow, thrive and in time be big contributors to UK society and the UK economy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/7">I want to acknowledge the immense courage of the former Prime Minister Edward Heath and his Government back in 1972. I must mention, of course, the generous response that the British people made to help Ugandan Asian refugees as they settled in the United Kingdom. As my hon. Friend the Member for North West Cambridgeshire said, it was a time when Britain was at its best.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/8">I want briefly to put the debate in the context of this Government&#8217;s work on integration or, as my hon. Friend</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/9">the Member for Worthing West would prefer to call it, inclusiveness. We are doing what we can to live up to our responsibility to create greater confidence among those who come to this country, encouraging greater responsibility, promoting more activities and opportunities for personal and social development and at the same time giving help, support and guidance. We are running some 30-odd projects to assist in that area to promote social mobility&#8212;for example, working with leading figures in the British Asian cuisine industry to offer young people chef scholarships.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/10">We are also working with private sector partners in the business world to inspire young people through our enterprise challenge and industrial cadet projects. To promote participation in our communities and responsibility to each other and society, we are supporting Youth United so that over 10,000 more young people from all backgrounds can come together as part of national movements such as the scouts and the police cadets. We continue to provide support for English language tuition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/11">In 1997, recognising the vitality lost to Uganda, President Museveni invited Ugandan Asians to return home. Some families returned, but most chose to remain in Britain. Those families have integrated into UK life and are one of this country&#8217;s biggest integration success stories. Later this year and next year a number of commemorative events will take place, including a thanksgiving event at Leicester cathedral and various dinners in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1063.0/12">I end by praising my hon. Friend the Member for North West Cambridgeshire for securing the debate, which has allowed us to remember properly the events of 1972, recognise the contribution of British Ugandan Asians and welcome their integration into the fabric of the nation. A number of commemorative events are still to be held over the next few months, and I urge all Members of the House to participate in them enthusiastically.</p>

	<p pid="a.1064.0/1">With the leave of the House, may I say that when the House debates people coming to this country there are often negative overtones, but it has been a pleasure&#8212;I think that all Members agree&#8212;to see today that the House is united in commemorating the 40th anniversary of the arrival of the Ugandan Asians, who have British passports and the majority of whom were of Indian origin. I thank all Members who have contributed to the debate by telling us about their personal experiences or those of their constituents. In so doing, we have finally recorded, 40 years on, the enormous contribution that this relatively small number of people&#8212;28,000&#8212;have made to the United Kingdom and the fact that Britain really was at its best. It showed its true character, its warmth, generosity and ability to care for those in need. To paraphrase a famous quote: they came, they saw, they integrated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1064.0/2" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1064.0/3" class="italic">Resolved,</p>
	<p pid="a.1064.0/4">That this House commemorates the 40th Anniversary of the arrival in Britain of Asians expelled from Uganda, notes their contribution to Britain and welcomes their integration into the fabric of the nation.</p>

	<p pid="a.1065.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House has considered the matter of defence personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/3">If I may, I would like to begin, rather oddly, by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase> on the previous debate, which was outstanding&#8212;despite the fact that it has taken time away from the defence debate. I think that it was a really worthwhile way of starting today&#8217;s Back-Bench business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/4">I am grateful to the Backbench Business Committee for granting us a debate on personnel issues. We discover that there is a disadvantage in having this debate during the week of the autumn statement, because has been relegated to the end of a day after not only the important debate we have just had, but important statements that have to be made following the autumn statement. Because there is less time than there might otherwise have been, I will take as little time as possible in order to allow everyone who wishes to speak to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/5">There will inevitably be subjects I do not cover. I am afraid that I will not cover the important issue of reductions of certain historic and well-recruited regiments, but I hope that, by not speaking about that, I will allow other right hon. and hon. Members to do so, and with greater knowledge than I could possibly show. I shall say little about redundancies or reservists, because the Defence Committee has recently conducted a number of inquiries into those subjects. Yesterday, we took the unusual step of announcing in advance the Committee&#8217;s programme for the remainder of this Parliament. It will include inquiries into some of these important matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/6">One of the advantages of having the debate today is that it seems to have prompted the Ministry of Defence to produce lots of documents, including its accounts for 2011-12 and the annual report on the covenant. It is always nice to have the MOD&#8217;s accounts, even if the auditor qualifies them, as always, by saying that they do not show a true or fair view of the state of the MOD&#8217;s finances. It would have been nicer still if we had had the accounts in June or July, when we should have done, but no doubt the accounting officer will be able to give an explanation when he comes before us next week&#8212;an event to which I know the whole Defence Committee will be looking forward enormously.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/7">Today&#8217;s annual report on the armed forces covenant is welcome. It reflects many of the suggestions made by the Committee in its continuing series of inquiries into the covenant, for example on doubling council tax</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/8">relief, on the false economy created by the pause in the refurbishment of single living accommodation, on home ownership and on health care, particularly mental health care, for veterans and reservists. Those are not acknowledged as being the Committee&#8217;s suggestions, but we know the terms of trade and do not mind that, so long as the MOD from time to time listens to what we say and does something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/9">The relationship between the MOD and the Select Committee needs to contain an element of constructive tension&#8212;almost scratchy; never cosy. Sometimes there is more tension than constructiveness, but I tell the Minister that the more open his Department is with the Committee, the more we can help to get his policies right. We shall shortly be producing a report on the Service Complaints Commissioner, who, as usual, gave us most helpful evidence a couple of weeks ago. I hope that the Minister will listen and respond positively to what we will say on Dr Atkins&#8217; extremely valuable role.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/10">The MOD does sometimes help us. Last week it helped the Committee to have an extremely valuable visit to Afghanistan as part of our normal programme of visiting our armed forces wherever they are deployed. Several issues arose, and they are what I want to concentrate on for the remainder of my short remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/11">I will touch first on welfare matters, starting with decompression. At the end of a six-month tour, we consider it essential to ensure that our troops are provided with a period of what is known as decompression. Often that takes place in Cyprus on the way home, when the returning troops, over a few kegs of beer, are reminded that their spouses will have been living their own lives while they were away and will not necessarily understand exactly what they have been through. These are absolutely essential reminders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/12">However, apparently decompression is not considered essential when our forces return for a two-week break in the middle of a tour. That suggests that we need to rethink the entire concept of the two-week break, not of decompression itself. Is the two-week break necessary or a good thing? For example, when our troops are working alongside the Americans, who, unlike British forces, get travel time taken off their break but get only a two-week rest and relaxation break in a one-year tour, does that create resentments on either side? Is the entire concept of a break destabilising? If, for operational reasons, someone&#8217;s break comes very near the beginning or end of their tour, what good does it do? The armed forces and the Ministry of Defence need to begin to think about these things very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/13">The armed forces sometimes need to make serious and difficult choices between welfare and operational output. I suspect that in 2014 the welfare of our troops in Afghanistan will be pretty minimal, frankly. We will have drawn down and taken away much of their support system, and, as we were told, they will be living out of the backs of their vehicles. The troops and, just as importantly, we need to know that, think about it, and accept it now. This is not about stopping looking after the armed forces who do so much for us; it is about putting it in the context that their primary task is operational, and that when they signed up they also signed up to an element of austerity when necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/14">Another issue that arose was detention. There is a genuine problem over the legal ability to transfer those whom we detain to the Afghan authorities, which were</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/15">accused in the past of mistreating one of the people we had previously transferred. We visited the detention facility in question, and we were impressed with the new deputy governor, who has a good international track record in observing and enforcing human rights. Nevertheless, we remain concerned that there should be a speedy solution to this problem. We must not run the risk of being forced to hold on to people whom our troops detain, because that might lengthen our involvement in Afghanistan in certain respects far beyond the period for which we would wish to be so involved. Still less must we put our troops at risk of being subject to any legal challenge regarding a failure to obey international law in what they have done. I suggest that in future there should always be an Afghan element in the capture, interrogation and detention of those suspected of insurgency or dealing in narcotics so that in all cases the detention is Afghan, not British, and the problem therefore does not arise. However, such a solution would require complicated discussions between ourselves and the Afghan authorities, and I appreciate that it will not be easy to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/16">Our role in Afghanistan now is to step back, and that is a very difficult thing for the British armed forces to do. Their natural inclination, as the sort of people they are with the sort of qualities they have, is to step in and help; that is what they are trained to do. However, we are now reaching the stage in Afghanistan where the best help we can give is not to help. One aspect of this is the insider threat, which is sometimes referred to as &#8220;green on blue&#8221;. One of the soldiers we talked to in Camp Bastion said that it is absolutely galling that the very people we are there to help might turn on us. The risk is not going to go away; all we can do is minimise it. My own view&#8212;I do not know about other members of the Defence Committee&#8212;is that we are doing our very best to achieve that. If we draw the conclusion that we cannot trust the Afghan security forces, we will be quite wrong. It is a fantastic country with wonderful people who are, let us not forget, being asked to learn in a few years what it took us centuries to learn. It will still be necessary for our troops to help to use the ISTAR&#8212;intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance&#8212;assets that we have and to call in the medical helicopters that are so highly regarded, but it will increasingly be less necessary for them to patrol alongside the Afghan patrols, which are becoming more capable day by day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/17">We came away from Afghanistan with a strong message. At the end of the summer, an instruction went out to the insurgents that they should fight their way through the winter. Despite that, the insurgency dropped away very suddenly. The insurgents are finding it increasingly hard to raise and retain their money and resources. They are also finding it very difficult to persuade their co-insurgents to fight Afghan soldiers, who are becoming increasingly competent. That competence is likely to increase with the advent of the academy for officer training, to be run along the lines of Sandhurst. We went to visit it. It is currently a building site, true, but the Afghans have begun to identify their first training officers and non-commissioned officers, who are clearly of extremely high quality. They have set themselves some enormously high challenges&#8212;for example, to have 150 female officer cadets a year passing through the</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/18">college. In the long run&#8212;this point was most validly made to us by President Karzai&#8212;the issue of the equal treatment of women is likely to be resolved not by western influence or by the hectoring of countries such as ours but by education and the visibility of the outside world provided by the internet.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/19">We found that security is no longer the primary issue of concern for most Afghans. There is still fear when people travel from one part of the country to another, but the ability of Afghans to farm in peace, and to get their goods to market on an increasingly secure road network, is being greatly improved. This has been achieved by a combination of the actions of our troops and the actions of the Afghan national security forces&#8212;police and army, pleasingly&#8212;in doing what our troops are training them to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/20">Some say that we should leave Afghanistan now. In one sense, that is what we are doing. If we wanted to leave tomorrow, it would in fact take us about 18 months to do so. We are doing it by leaving in place a working security apparatus that will help to ensure that Afghanistan does not again become a threat to this country. By staying involved after the end of combat operations in 2014, we will ensure that there is transition, not abandonment. The strongest message that we received from our personnel in Afghanistan was that we should hold our nerve and stick to the plan, which is a good one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/21">Here I should acknowledge something: I was wrong. I believed that by setting a date for us to leave Afghanistan we were playing into the hands of the Taliban, who would just wait us out. I told the Prime Minister that if we concentrated on success, we would make it easier for us to leave, whereas if we concentrated on leaving, we would make it harder for us to succeed. It hard for me to say this, but the Prime Minister and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40149" name="John Stevenson">the Member for Carlisle (John Stevenson)</phrase> were quite right and I was quite wrong. In practice, the Afghans needed us to step back, and they needed a timetable. Arguably, by setting a date in 2014 the Prime Minister bought more time for the international security assistance force to achieve transition than it would have had if the time scale had been left open ended.</p>
	<p pid="a.1065.2/22">Finally, I would like to pay tribute to our armed forces. They are going through a tough time at the moment, as is the entire country. They know they are not immune from the financial hardship afflicting us all. They are facing redundancies, reductions in the pensions they can expect and a smaller total expenditure on defence.</p>

We will have to wait to hear from the Minister whether this has been affected by the changes announced in yesterday&#8217;s autumn statement, but he will have heard the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s intervention and will no doubt be eager to cover it in his contribution, even if he does not look too eager at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.1068.1/3">As I have said, the Chief of the General Staff appeared before us and he said that this was a worrying and destabilising time for the armed forces. Picking up on the hon.

	<p pid="a.1069.2/1">Yes, I am holding a piece of paper&#8212;or several of them&#8212;in my hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.2/2">Before the right hon. Member for North East Hampshire beats himself up too much about having been wrong, he should remember that we have not yet withdrawn from Afghanistan. I hope that we will both end up having to say that we have been proved wrong, but we should be anything but complacent about what happens in Afghanistan and about the ease of withdrawal. The closer we get to the withdrawal date and the more we have to ensure the safety of our own troops&#8212;we are not entirely clear who provides that security&#8212;the more difficult it will get. The situation reminds me of when children leave home: we cannot wait for them to leave home, but the closer the time gets, the more nervous we get about them having to step out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.2/3">I want to start by addressing a big issue and then move on to something more specific. I am often accused of having a typical foreigner&#8217;s emotional attachment to British institutions, which is probably true of a few people. I have always been extremely proud of a country that has a sense of itself and its role in the world, but the recent strategic defence reviews and what has been happening in other Departments have made me begin to wonder whether we still have that sense of self and of our role in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.2/4">I would assert that we now have a Ministry of Defence that says that we will provide the amount of troops that we can afford in order to balance the books, rather than</p>
	<p pid="a.1069.2/5">starting off by saying, &#8220;This is the role we wish to play in the world.&#8221; I would have expected a strategic defence review to start by saying, &#8220;We have a Navy because we are an island and therefore we need x, y and z,&#8221; and, &#8220;Our air force is a certain size because we have assessed the risk from the air.&#8221; The commitment and engagement that we wish to see outside these islands should determine the size of our Army. I have seen no such clear statement as to what we are about.</p>

	<p pid="a.1070.0/1">I absolutely agree with and entirely endorse what the hon. Lady says about the foreign policy baseline for any strategic defence review, but does she not agree that, if we were to start from that standpoint, it would be almost inevitable that we would end up with a requirement that was vastly greater than the nation could afford?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1070.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40080" speakername="Gisela Stuart" colnum="1070"  time="014:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0003.htm#12120640001276">
	<p pid="a.1070.1/1">That may well be the case, but we have to start with where we think we should be and then we can work out where we ought to be. It is not just the MOD that lacks that strategic sense. At one stage, the Department for International Development had a clear statutory duty of poverty reduction, but even that is being reviewed and rethought at the moment&#8212;I am not entirely sure where that takes us. Our Foreign Office is also reducing its influence. If we consider how this country projects itself to the rest of the world, we will see that there is a lack of clarity in those lead Departments that ought to provide a collective view.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.1/2">I asked myself whether this was happening all over the world and looked at comparative figures for GDP spending on NATO. Even if we look back as far as the 1950s, there is a consistent pattern within the European Union. Our country and France contribute well over 2% of GDP commitment, so we clearly have a view on where we should be in terms of spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.1/3">It is sometimes difficult to make comparisons between armed forces numbers, because we ended conscription. The Italian and German figures in particular&#8212;they sometimes include police forces&#8212;are somewhat misleading, but nevertheless the pattern shows that we are still big significant players. We have no sense, however, of why we want to be the big players. What are we going to do?</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.1/4">I want to leave the Minister with a final example of that muddled, confused thinking. In my experience, it is always when we are not entirely sure what we want to say that we end up constructing sentences that are utterly meaningless. The Defence Committee took evidence yesterday on the Army 2020 review and I was struck by something called, &#8220;Figure 1: Force Development Deductions&#8221;. I invite the Minister to look at the relevant paragraph. I will not bore the House by reading it. It has about 10 sentences and I am glad that the word &#8220;broadband&#8221; is in there, because that is about the only word I understood. I drew the attention of our witness, General Sir Peter Wall, to that paragraph and asked him about it, and he confessed his confusion about the precise meaning of that integral part of the report. He promised the Committee that he would consult the Babel fish and provide us with an English translation. I think that demonstrates that the MOD needs to be much clearer, particularly post-Afghanistan, of what we think our forces are for. It is no good just to say, &#8220;This is how much money we&#8217;ve got,&#8221; even though the money is important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.1/5">This might again be a sign of my emotional attachment as a foreigner, but I am always struck by the island blindness of this country. This is an island, so how can we compromise some of our surveillance abilities? What will happen to maritime security? It is staggering. That is my general point for the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1070.1/6">My second point is much more grounded at home. Last week, I went to meet Malala Yousafzai&#8217;s father&#8212;the family are currently in my constituency at the Queen Elizabeth hospital and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine, which do extraordinary work. It was particularly pleasing for me to see that good work, because I was the evil Minister who closed down the military hospitals in places such as Gosport and I remember being denounced in endless Adjournment debates for doing so.</p>

	<p pid="a.1071.1/1">But we closed them not because we wanted to, but because the royal colleges were telling us that the MOD could no longer provide the best medical services. Ten years ago, the NHS looked at the Ministry of Defence and said, &#8220;You guys really need to step up to the plate and improve your act.&#8221; Now, some of the work within defence medicine is miles ahead of what the NHS is doing in terms of rehabilitation and care. We have unexpected survival rates among soldiers, which one can see in the latest evidence from Afghanistan, that are well beyond what the NHS could do. That is a good development.</p>

	<p pid="a.1071.2/1">To go back to the hon. Lady&#8217;s point about numbers, I declare an interest because my mother was Italian. Her point about the carabinieri being included is right. In my experience, the Chief of the General Staff is a very plain-speaking gentleman. If there has been any difficulty with that particular paragraph, I am sure that she will get a very clear reply.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071.2/2">I echo her comments with regard to the role of 3 hospital at Camp Bastion. The stunning statistic from that facility in Helmand is that however severely wounded they are, 98% of the people who go through its doors alive come out alive. That is an incredible statistic and we pay tribute to that hospital.</p>

	<p pid="a.1071.3/1">I also want to draw attention to the creation of the Fisher house on the site of the Queen Elizabeth hospital, which has 18 en-suite rooms. It will be ready next year and will have much better facilities for the families. That is another good development.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071.3/2">I do have concerns about the future. At the moment, our young injured heroes are young injured heroes. In 10 or 20 years&#8217; time, they will be middle-aged, probably overweight like many of us, and will no longer have the image of a hero. Will we still look after them properly then? The military covenant mentions that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071.3/3">The paper on the military covenant, which arrived so nicely in time for this debate, refers to the establishment of</p>
	<p pid="a.1071.3/4">&#8220;a unified Defence Primary Healthcare Service&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071.3/5">I urge the Minister to talk to colleagues in the NHS about this matter, because I am in no way convinced that the commissioning structures that are being put in</p>
	<p pid="a.1071.3/6">place, now that primary care trusts are no longer doing the commissioning, are sufficient to ensure that the very specialist services that our veterans need are provided not just for the next year, five years or 10 years, but in the long term. It is so much easier for Americans, because registering as a veteran gives them access to free medical health care. We do not have that in this country and it is easy to forget that in years to come, they will still have very special needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071.3/7">I read through the report just before the debate and it states that we are planning to create that service, but we need to be more specific. Will it be a specialist commissioning unit? Will there be national commissioning? If so, how will it work throughout England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, given that health is a devolved issue? This is going to be key in the long term to veterans trusting what we provide through the military covenant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1071.3/8">This is a very useful debate. The key thing that I urge the Minister to go away with is that we need to have a much clearer sense of purpose and of what we want our armed forces to do. We must not just look at them when they have been injured or have given their life, as important as that is; I want them to be honoured, celebrated and recognised for the job that they want to do, and that is the job of fighting. We as a country need to have a sense of when we think something is worth fighting for. That needs to be spelt out at some stage or another by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1072.0/1">I thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> and the Backbench Business Committee for securing the time for this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072.0/2">The defence of the realm and the security of our people is the first and most important duty of any Government. Governments must demonstrate that they value the service and sacrifices of the men and women who serve in our armed forces. Our defence personnel, both on operations and at home, do an awesome job. I know that the House is hugely grateful for everything that they do. I would like to put my personal thanks and appreciation on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072.0/3">We must ensure that our defence personnel have the kit that they need, and that we are clear and candid with them about the changes and challenges that they face. If we do that well, we will create an armed forces and a Ministry of Defence that are militarily effective and sustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072.0/4">The Government have done much of which they can be justly proud in regard to our defence personnel. The historic enshrining in law of the military covenant will change for ever how Governments and our society fulfil their obligations to our forces personnel, veterans and their families. The doubling of the operational allowance was also most welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072.0/5">However, aspects of the 2012 armed forces continuous attitude survey should give us all pause for thought and concern. Satisfaction with pay and pensions is down and our troops feel undervalued. The Government must appreciate that, no matter how resilient our armed forces are, uncertainty over their future is breeding low morale. I would like the Minister to address in his</p>
	<p pid="a.1072.0/6">winding-up speech what steps the Department will take to ensure that all defence personnel are informed in a transparent and direct manner of exactly what changes will be affecting them as soon as is practical. Our armed forces are the best of Britain&#8212;there is no doubt about that&#8212;and they understand that changes need to take place. So let us not insult their intelligence. Let us be as clear and as frank as we can be. They will respect that, whatever the decisions may be.</p>
	<p pid="a.1072.0/7">There are changes that need to be made. When the Government took office, it became abundantly clear that there was no money left. Under the last Government, the MOD was placed in special measures by the Treasury because of its inability to manage its budget. By making the difficult decisions and taking action, this Government have brought the finances back in order and under control.</p>

	<p pid="a.1073.0/1">I am intrigued by that point. The claim of both <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the right hon. Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase> and the current Defence Secretary is that they were left a &#163;38 billion black hole. They seem to have plugged that within two years, which is remarkable. Clearly, the two of them should be Chancellor. I notice that there is no mention of that in the introduction to today&#8217;s annual accounts. We are still waiting for the figures. How can the hon. Gentleman claim that the budget has been balanced when no such evidence has been produced by the Department?</p>

	<p pid="a.1073.1/1">There is no question but that the MOD&#8217;s finances were a mess when we took office. The words that I used were that the Government have &#8220;brought the finances back in order and under control.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1073.1/2">I praise the Government&#8217;s ambition to have a more flexible armed forces on a sustainable footing, but I disagree that a smaller armed forces is needed. Ministers have said repeatedly that no one wants to see reductions in our armed forces, so why are we protecting spending on international development and aid and giving &#163;9.3 billion a year to the EU? I was elected, as were my hon. Friends, on a mandate that called for an increase in the size of the Army.</p>

	<p pid="a.1073.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. and gallant Friend. Does he share my concern that the further reductions or economies in defence spending that were announced yesterday may well end up as yet another reduction in the number of combat personnel in the armed forces?</p>

	<p pid="a.1073.3/2">I raised in a previous debate a point about the EU budget and foreign aid budgets being protected or increasing, and I was pleased when the former Defence Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40039" name="Gerald Howarth">the hon. Member for Aldershot (Sir Gerald Howarth)</phrase>, said that there is an alternative</p>
	<p pid="a.1073.3/3">&#8220;and it is to reprioritise Government spending&#8230;we cannot justify spending ever more taxpayers&#8217; money on overseas aid and cutting our armed forces.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-10-18.521"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 October 2012; Vol. 551, c. 521</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1073.3/4">My constituents and I are concerned that the planned reductions will leave us with the smallest Army since the Napoleonic wars. History shows that we rarely see the</p>
	<p pid="a.1073.3/5">next war coming. We do not choose our wars&#8212;they choose us. Although our security is still largely protected by the Government&#8217;s plans, there must come a point when we draw a line in the sand and say to the Treasury, &#8220;No more reductions and no more cuts.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1073.3/6">Defence Equipment and Support is based in my constituency. Many of my constituents work there and some have told me that changes are needed in the way it is structured and operates. Those civilian personnel are vital to the future of our armed forces and carry out crucial tasks. I have visited DE and S and have seen at first hand how important procurement, logistics and back-office operations are to the effectiveness and well-being of our troops in theatre and elsewhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073.3/7">I look forward to an announcement on the proposed changes early in the new year so that the uncertainty felt by my constituents&#8212;and others who work at DE and S&#8212;is addressed. Whatever reforms the Government propose for DE and S, I ask them to seek cross-party support. The future of DE and S will have a long-term effect on the capability of our armed forces. It is in our national interest that the best kit for our troops is delivered at the right time to the right place, and of course we must also deliver the value for money to the taxpayer. Members on both Front Benches have a duty to work together to minimise the uncertainty and anxiety of DE and S personnel now and in the years to come with a reassurance that a future Government will not rip it up and start again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1073.3/8">The Government have said that reserves will be at the heart of an adaptable whole force and I welcome the reserves review and the Future Force 2020 report. If the reserves of the future are to play an integral part in the defence of the realm, they must be fully integrated with regular forces on operations and exercise. I welcome the Government&#8217;s commitment to an additional &#163;1.8 billion over the next decade for new equipment and training for reserves, as well as the consultation paper on engaging employers, which is crucial.</p>

	<p pid="a.1074.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. The attitude and support of employers is crucial for future reserves, and whether they succeed or fail largely depends on how we support smaller businesses that allow their employees to be deployed on operations and exercises for long periods of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1074.1/2">I am concerned about the post-deployment and aftercare of mobilised reservists. To serve their country on operations, reservists take a break from normal civilian, family and professional life, in most cases for up to a year. It is much harder for reservists to adjust to post-deployment life than it is for regular forces, because of the added factor of trying to get back to normal day-to-day life without the kind of support that a full-time soldier would receive, surrounded by comrades and the regimental family. A person could be out on the ground in Afghanistan, but a few weeks or months later they go back to their civilian job and are surrounded by people who have no</p>
	<p pid="a.1074.1/3">understanding of what they have been through. I hope Ministers recognise that and will ensure that adequate provision is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1074.1/4">I would like the House to consider the words of Lord Healey, a former Chancellor and Secretary of State for Defence who served as Royal Engineer in the north African campaign, the allied liberation of Sicily and the Italian campaign, and who was the military landing officer for the British assault brigade at Anzio.

	<p pid="a.1075.0/2">I will concentrate on the forthcoming base review, and I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response to get clarity on why the statement is not being made on Tuesday and on when we can expect it. The base review is directly related to defence personnel because it will concentrate on arrangements for the return of UK forces from Germany and confirm the configuration of basing arrangements&#8212;which units go where, which will change their role or close, and which will not return. That is what we expect to hear.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.0/3">We should put ourselves in the position of servicemen and women and their families, whether they are at a base in the UK, Germany or somewhere else. It is coming up to Christmas and they are expecting some clarity, but unfortunately they will not get it, which is a shame. It would be helpful for the Minister to offer clarity on the time scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.1075.0/4">I want to focus on the impact of the basing review on service personnel and communities not only in the UK, but in Germany. I had the good fortune to be in Lower Saxony two weeks ago&#8212;I visited the area around the Bergen-Hohne training area&#8212;to meet the local authorities. An announcement on basing will have an impact on those authorities and the service and civilian communities around the training area. Speaking to the mayor of Bad Fallingbostel, Rainer Schmuck, reminded me of the experience we had in Moray recently&#8212;as part of the review of RAF bases, the local community had to plan for all kind of eventualities, which is incredibly destabilising. The basing announcement will have a tremendous impact on local authority budgets available in communities such as Bad Fallingbostel.</p>

	<p pid="a.1076.0/1">That is a good question. I met the premier of Lower Saxony, David McAllister, when I was in Germany. Because many of the decisions to be taken on amelioration of basing policy are effectively devolved functions&#8212;L&#228;ndersache&#8212;in Germany, decision makers such as David McAllister will have to work with local communities to help with the transition following any announcement on the basing review. Not one of my interlocutors both at L&#228;nder and community level was aware of any fixed timetable beyond what was said in previous statements. I was not told that there has been any clarity on what is likely to happen. I am sure the Minister does not disagree&#8212;he will no doubt say that clarity will be given as soon as possible&#8212;but I should underline the point that many hon. Members were given the impression that we would hear on Tuesday, but it now appears that we will not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/2">For communities such as Bad Fallingbostel, the likelihood of the withdrawal of UK forces is significant. The role of the military in that part of the world goes back a long time, to the time of the Hanoverian redcoats. While they were tramping around parts of Scotland in the mid-18th century, they were also beginning to train on the L&#252;neburg Heath. The area has since become the most significant training area anywhere in Europe. A series of communities around the training area, whether in Bergen, Celle or Bad Fallingbostel itself, are exceptionally defence dependent. The impact of the basing review is significant not only in Lower Saxony; there are large-scale UK military presences in places such as G&#252;tersloh and Paderborn. We should not lose sight of the fact that basing announcements will be relevant not only here, but in friendly nations such as Germany. It is important that people there have as much notice of any changes as we have here, and as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/3">I have a couple of constituency matters to raise. Right hon. and hon. Members know that I represent one of the most defence-dependent constituencies in the UK&#8212;it contains RAF Lossiemouth and Kinloss barracks. I stress to the Minister that I am hearing loud and clear that people want clarity on what will happen. There is uncertainty on the time scale for the transfer of the Typhoons from Leuchars and uncertainty in Leuchars about what will happen at the base. There is uncertainty in Angus about the Condor facility, which has been there for a very long time. If the Minister is not aware of that uncertainty, I strongly advise him to look closely at the trends at bases such as RAF Lossiemouth, where over and above compulsory and voluntary release we are seeing, in some very important trade groups and specialisations, people leaving in droves. That is due largely to uncertainty and, it has to be said, the success of the offshore oil and gas industry, which is offering tremendous opportunities to people starting a career in the civilian world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/4">It would be useful to remind ourselves of the commitments given on basing, which I imagine will be the starting point for the Ministry of Defence. We do not have to look back very far, because the previous Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the right hon. Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase>, was explicit about the MOD&#8217;s plans for Scotland and I would like to remind the House what they are. He made a statement on defence transformation, and I will read the entire paragraph, because it is important:</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/5">&#8220;Army brigades currently stationed around Catterick and Salisbury will make up three of the five multi-role brigades. The other two MRBs will be based in the east of England, centred on Cottesmore, and in Scotland, centred on Kirknewton, south-west of Edinburgh. The MRB centred in Scotland will require a new training area, and positive discussions are being taken forward with the Scottish Government. Two major units and a formation headquarters will be based at Leuchars, increasing the number of posts there from 1,200 to more than 1,300. Consequently, the Typhoon force due to be built up there will instead be built up at RAF Lossiemouth. Other MRB units will be moved into Glencorse, Caledonia, Albemarle barracks and eventually Arbroath, as we intend over time to bring the bulk of the Royal Marines together in the south-west.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-06-18.644"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 June 2011; Vol. 531, c. 644-5</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/6">That was outlined only last year, and there is no ambiguity whatsoever. A month later, he went on to give welcome clarity on numbers. When asked about the number of troops expected to return from Germany to Scotland, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/7">&#8220;It is impossible to give an exact number, but I would imagine that between 6,500 and 7,000, or something of that order, of the 20,000 personnel we currently have in Germany will be coming back to the multi-role brigades in Scotland. The precise number and lay-down will be subject to the plans that the Army will bring forward in the months and years ahead, assuming of course that we have the agreement of the local authorities and the Scottish Government.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-07-18.655"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 July 2011; Vol. 531, c. 655</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/8">The UK Government obviously had the support of the Scottish Government in relation to the training area and any planning that would need to take place. That was a very clear and unambiguous commitment about the number of troops coming back from Germany to Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/9">All the mood music and noise we hear about the basing review makes me concerned that there will be a rowing back on those commitments only a year after they were made. The context is important and we should not lose sight of it. The former Secretary of State for Defence gave an important number when he told the Select Committee on Scottish Affairs on <phrase class="date" code="2011-06-07">7 June 2011</phrase> that</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/10">&#8220;between 2000 and 2010, the total reduction&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/11">in service jobs&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/12">&#8220;was 11.6% but the reduction in Scotland was 27.9%. Over the decade 2000 to 2010 there were bigger reductions made in total personnel as a proportion than in other parts of the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1076.0/13">That is the inheritance with which we have found ourselves, and we have the commitment given by the former Secretary of State that one would try to make good some of the disproportionate cuts visited on defence in Scotland.</p>

Gentleman has to say and I am reluctant to bring a note of party political angst into what has been an extremely well informed and sensible debate so far.

	<p pid="a.1078.0/1">I am interested that the hon. Gentleman has an insight into the policy of future UK Governments wishing to withdraw troops from different parts of the UK. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Will Government Members let me answer? I have spoken for the majority of my comments about the presence of troops in other countries. It would be entirely possible&#8212;in fact, would it not be advantageous?&#8212;for Scottish troops to continue to train and operate in the area of England he represents, and I see no reason why troops from the rest of the UK could not continue to operate in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="a.1078.2/1">Forgive me, but I want to make some progress. I know that other right hon. and hon. Gentlemen wish to speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.1078.2/2">It is helpful, when talking about the level of commitment to the defence footprint in Scotland, to be reminded of the facts. Only four infantry battalions are based in Scotland. The Scottish-recruited infantry is now smaller than the infantry of the Irish Republic. Further to the infantry battalions, we have 39 Engineer Regiment in the newly renamed Kinloss barracks. It is important to note that manning levels there are 41% lower than the previous RAF establishment total and that no regular Army units are based in Scotland in the following and important categories: artillery, armour, signals, logistics, air corps, intelligence and special forces. There are no military training establishments in Scotland, which means no military academy, no engineering schools, no Army training regiments, no infantry training centres and no senior strategic military command.</p>
	<p pid="a.1078.2/3">Even at this late stage, as the Government go through what they planned to announce in the basing review, which is exceptionally important to service personnel, I appeal to them not to go back on their commitments. Only a year ago, promises were made, and they should be kept. On a related note, the covenant has mentioned. I agree that everything should be done to deliver on it. As the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston pointed out, however, a large number of policy areas relating to the covenant are devolved. I observe that the Minister with responsibility for liaising with devolved Administrations has yet to speak to the Scottish Government since taking office. Having been asked for a meeting by the Scottish Government, he has yet to reply and make it happen.</p>

	<p pid="a.1078.5/1">I am responsible for my diary, and I met Keith Brown, MSP, who is the transport and veterans Minister in the Scottish Government, some weeks ago. He is an ex-Royal Marine. It is fair to say that we had a constructive meeting. I have met the person in the Scottish Government responsible for the issue I am responsible for in the UK Government, so to try and imply that the UK Government are not in a dialogue with these people is incorrect.</p>

	<p pid="a.1078.6/1">&#8220;These people&#8221; being the Minister and the Scottish Government. I am pleased that the Minister has met Keith Brown; I am just pointing out</p>
	<p pid="a.1078.6/2">that the UK MOD Minister responsible for relations with the devolved Administrations has not followed his lead. Perhaps he might encourage him to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1078.6/3">I hope that the Government do not go back on their commitments at this late stage. I do not believe that any sovereign Scottish Government of any mainstream hue would manage defence in the way the UK Government have done, with disproportionate cuts to manpower, spending and basing. It is time to make better defence decisions in Scotland. The Scottish National party has committed to uniform personnel levels of 15,000 in Scotland&#8212;4,000 more than the 11,000 the UK currently has based there&#8212;but we will only be able to do that after a yes vote in the 2014 independence referendum. I look forward to that greatly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1079.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40455" speakername="James Gray" colnum="1079"  time="015:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0003.htm#12120640001301">
	<p pid="a.1079.0/1">This has been a fascinating, well balanced and intelligent debate, covering a wide variety of topics. That includes the contribution from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40409" name="Angus Robertson">the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase>, whom I am delighted to follow. He knows his stuff and has made a useful contribution to the all-party armed forces group over the years. I am grateful to him for that, although the possibility of he and I ever coming to a mutual understanding on what will happen to defence in the unlikely event of Scottish independence is perhaps rather remote. I am grateful to him for his remarks and his help over the years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1079.0/2">I rather regret that the old parliamentary tradition of set-piece defence debates has been abolished&#8212;I seem to recall that at one time there were six, and then there were three, I think. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Defence Committee, has made representations on this subject to the Procedure Committee, on which I sit. Those debates have been replaced by a bid&#8212;in this case to be made by the Defence Committee&#8212;to the Backbench Business Committee for time. That means that defence, which ought to be the greatest and heaviest duty of the nation, has to compete with other more topical, interesting or amusing subjects for debating time. That is wrong. The Procedure Committee has considered whether time should be given for set-piece debates of this kind and has undertaken to keep the subject under review. It is always worth making the point that we ought to have set-piece debates during the year on defence, the Intelligence and Security Committee and one or two other equally grave and weighty subjects, which might not be quite as popular as some others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1079.0/3">Today&#8217;s debate is about defence personnel. If defence of the realm is our greatest duty, it is right that paying our respects, thanks and homage to the people who make that possible&#8212;our armed forces&#8212;should be high on our list of priorities as a Parliament. I am therefore glad that in recent years we have had the opportunity to welcome back the two brigades a year that return from Afghanistan, as we did successfully the other day. I am grateful to Mr Speaker, Black Rod, the Serjeant at Arms and others who make those parades possible. They are terribly important in allowing Parliament to remember and be physically shown the people we have sent off to war. They are also terribly important from the brigades&#8217; point of view.</p>
	<p pid="a.1079.0/4">Let me quote from a letter I received this morning from the commander of 12th Mechanized Brigade, who came to Parliament last week:</p>
	<p pid="a.1079.0/5">&#8220;The opportunity to celebrate and thank our young soldiers is rarely done in such a special way. Although respect for our soldiers is often talked about, the Parliamentary Parade and reception brought it firmly home to me that those sentiments are both genuine and heartfelt. Understanding this was particularly important for the more junior members on parade, as it is they who often faced the gravest danger and all too often it is our youngest who are forced to make the ultimate sacrifice. When that price is paid we know that they will never be forgotten. That response is often expressed by others as well. Last Monday confirmed that it is truly meant by those we serve.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1079.0/6">Brigadier Chalmers&#8217; letter is of great importance and brings it home to us that it is right and proper to pay our respects to those young soldiers. We should be aware that the things they do&#8212;as well as the discomforts they face, quite apart from the dangers&#8212;are things that very few people in this Chamber would ever contemplate doing themselves. We should take this opportunity to thank and pay tribute to them for all they do.</p>

	<p pid="a.1080.4/1">My hon. Friend not only anticipates what I was about to say but rips the heart out of the central part of the comments that I was about to make. I shall come to that subject in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080.4/2">The way in which the people of Britain respect our armed forces has changed over the years. It was unanimous after the second world war, as we knew what our armed forces had done for us through those years. At certain</p>
	<p pid="a.1080.4/3">times since, there has been a similar increase in respect for them. There have also been periods, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s, when people&#8217;s knowledge of and respect for our armed forces has been significantly lower.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080.4/4">I pay respect to my own constituents in Royal Wootton Bassett for the way in which they welcomed home the fallen soldiers for five or six years before handing back the duty to Brize Norton in the Prime Minister&#8217;s constituency. They spoke for the nation in paying their respects to the armed forces and the way in which they had served. They did so quietly, modestly and sensibly without pomp or ceremony. They simply stood in the high street getting wet and bowing their heads at the appropriate moment. They spoke for the people of Britain and the way in which we respect our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1080.4/5">A similar transition in attitudes has occurred here in Parliament. After the retired brigadiers and soldiers who had served in the second world war had retired from this place some 20 or 30 years ago, I suspect that our knowledge of and respect for our armed forces declined significantly for a time. That would have been around the late &#8217;60s and early &#8217;70s, when not much was happening of a military nature and most Members of Parliament who had been soldiers, sailors or airmen had retired.</p>

There were a lot of Royal Marines there, and I would like to pay tribute to them. Those events would certainly have kept people interested in what was going on in the military.</p>

	<p pid="a.1081.1/1">My hon. Friend never misses an opportunity to speak up for the Royal Marines, and he is absolutely correct. I was not for one second suggesting that the House was silent on these matters during those years; I merely said that their prominence had declined somewhat at various times over the past 50 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081.1/2">Into that relative desert of knowledge, awareness and understanding of our armed forces came the figure of Sir Neil Thorne&#8212;this is where my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40415" name="Julian Lewis">the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis)</phrase> did me a disservice a moment ago. Realising the shortage of information and awareness in the House, Sir Neil created the armed forces parliamentary scheme 25 years ago this year. Since then, he has run the scheme more or less single-handed. He has help from a variety of people, but he is the driving force behind it. The scheme has gone through all sorts of changes. When I joined it in 1997, it was extremely small, with one MP from each side of the House attached to each of the four services. This year, there are about 70 people involved, including MEPs, Clerks of the House, Members of the House of Lords and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081.1/3">The work of the armed forces parliamentary scheme under Sir Neil has significantly increased the level of understanding and awareness of our armed forces and, in particular, of the work done by our boys and girls on the ground. A significant cadre of Members of Parliament now truly understand what happens on the ground. MPs are embedded for up to 22 days a year, perhaps wearing some kind of uniform, and they get intimately involved with activities of our armed forces on a variety</p>
	<p pid="a.1081.1/4">of levels. That is central to the excellence of the understanding that the scheme has brought to this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081.1/5">In that context, it is probably known around the House that there will be some changes coming to the armed forces parliamentary scheme. Sir Neil has indicated that he would like to see changes, and the Secretary of State for Defence and Mr Speaker have joined him in that. The scheme will soon be re-established as a charitable trust under nine trustees, and we very much look forward to its continuation under the slightly new format.</p>
	<p pid="a.1081.1/6">Two things are central. First, it seems to me essential that the armed forces parliamentary scheme should remain as it is, or very much like it is, for 25 or 50 years to come. It would be no good at all if we said right now, &#8220;That&#8217;s it. It has been great, but let&#8217;s say goodbye to it&#8221;. We must not do that&#8212;the armed forces parliamentary scheme plays a terribly important part in all our parliamentary debates. Secondly, there are all sorts of ways of doing this, but on this 25th anniversary of the scheme&#8217;s foundation, it is terribly important that we pay due respect to the fantastic contribution to the defence of realm and to our understanding of it that Sir Neil and his wife have made. He has done a great job; it is right that we should acknowledge it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1082.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that Sir Neil has not only put in a large amount of his own time and considerable expertise but has invested a large amount of his own money into creating the scheme, and that it is has proved so successful that it has been copied in other countries around the world and has given rise to similar schemes for the police, for example?</p>

	<p pid="a.1082.1/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right: Sir Neil&#8217;s personal contribution in respect of time, money and, indeed, the excellent Lady Thorne has been significant. A similar scheme has been established in Australia and, as my right hon. Friend says, there is a similar police scheme in existence&#8212;in this Parliament, and who knows where else it might spread.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082.1/2">On an occasion such as today&#8217;s when we are talking about defence personnel, it is right to pay our respects to and honour those people who do things that we in the Chamber could not contemplate doing, although one or two of us have done them&#8212;my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40260" name="Jack Lopresti">the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Jack Lopresti)</phrase>, for example, who is not in his place at the moment. He has had the great advantage of having spent six months in Afghanistan, with 36 hours of contact, firing a light gun at the enemy. Very few Members of Parliament have achieved anything of that kind; I think we should pay our respects to my hon. Friend for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1082.1/3">It is right that we should make use of the armed forces parliamentary scheme, the all-party group for the armed forces and the welcome homes. We should also celebrate the respects paid to the armed forces down the streets of Royal Wootton Bassett&#8212;or now in Carterton in Oxfordshire. The people of the United Kingdom and the Members of this House understand what a great contribution our armed forces make to the defence of our realm. It is right that we should convert that understanding into visible signs of it; various organisations do that very well.</p>

	<p pid="a.1083.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the right hon. Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> on setting the scene so well, providing some focus for many of us. I thank other hon. Members who have also made significant, worthwhile and knowledgeable contributions to the debate, and those who will do the same in a few moments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.0/2">I begin by saying that I stand in support of the tremendous sacrifice and work that our defence personnel carry out every day of their lives. As a member of the armed forces parliamentary scheme&#8212;there are others dotted around the Chamber&#8212;I have been privileged to see a lot of what our soldiers, sailors, airmen and women do around the world, and it makes me even more thankful for the job they do, away from friends and family on the front line or in training or when stationed elsewhere. We do not always know what they daily go through&#8212;I know membership of the armed forces parliamentary scheme provides some indication of it&#8212;in service to Queen and country. We know that because of them there is freedom and democracy not only in this United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland but right across the world&#8212;and for that we are truly and immensely grateful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.0/3">Many of us will have watched films on TV based on the wars in the past&#8212;from the American war of independence, the American civil war and on to the Great war&#8212;and we all have seen the march of troops head on into the firing line. That is not the way wars are fought today: warfare has evolved, and the British Army has evolved with it, remaining the foremost Army in the world. I believe that this must remain so. We have obligations worldwide in the security of our nation and in playing our part to help those who are oppressed or living in injustice. Those aims must continue to be fulfilled by whatever shape the new Army takes. The British Army and this Government have not been found wanting when it comes to promoting those good objectives&#8212;in Iraq, in Afghanistan and elsewhere across the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.0/4">I want to focus on the changes that will follow the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the draw-down from Germany, and to do so from a Northern Ireland perspective. I want to reflect on what the Army expects to look like then, and, more important, on Northern Ireland&#8217;s role in the 2020 British Army.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.0/5">Northern Ireland has a rich military history. Although we are such a small part of the United Kingdom, our incredible level of military service&#8212;which is backed up by the figures&#8212;demonstrates that we are intrinsic to the make-up of the greatness of that great nation. It is clear from the fact that Northern Ireland contains only 3% of the United Kingdom&#8217;s population but provides 20% of the reserve forces on active service that we more than play our part. We have much to offer in Northern Ireland as a major part of the evolution of the armed forces.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1083.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" speakername="Jim Shannon" colnum="1083"  time="015:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0003.htm#12120640001313">
	<p pid="a.1083.2/1">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s facts are absolutely correct. I thank him for what he has said. Let me also take the opportunity to thank him for the immense</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.2/2">contribution that he has made in his former role as a soldier, both in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the world, and in particular for the part that he played, as an officer in his regiment, in the peace that we now have in Northern Ireland. His contribution is not often mentioned, and I wanted to put it on the record.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.2/3">By tradition, we in Northern Ireland have never had to be conscripted to provide service personnel. We go above and beyond our duty, and that should be acknowledged and respected. Although in many instances the troubles in Northern Ireland highlighted segregation, the Army and the cadets now recruit from all sectors of the community. I want to stress to the Minister the importance of our cadets and reserve forces to community involvement and community-building. The Army works hard in those different parts of the community to show people what a great career can be enjoyed in the forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.2/4">Our cadet force recruitment has been second to none, crossing the religious and political divides. The highest levels of recruitment are from areas that are traditionally less supportive of the military&#8212;Strabane, Londonderry, Limavady and Enniskillen. The importance of the cadet forces to our society cannot be sufficiently underlined. Northern Ireland, in my view, has the most rationalised and efficient cadets in the United Kingdom. We develop a higher proportion of our soldiers and sailors on operations than any other region, and we have the most and the best recruitment in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.2/5">The main link between the Ministry of Defence and the communities in Northern Ireland is first through the cadets and secondly through the reserves. The success story lies in the fact that people from what are, perhaps, the traditionally less supportive areas are now joining the cadets in rising numbers. The position must be enhanced in the future, and that demands a commitment from the Ministry of Defence: cadets today, reserves and a full-time Army tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.2/6">I believe that there is much scope for Northern Ireland to house and facilitate the training of troops in buildings that are already owned and operated by the British Army. I suggest that Thiepval barracks in Lisburn, which currently houses the 38th Brigade, should be retained and enhanced. The draw-down from Germany will provide an opportunity for that to be done. The garrison at Ballykinler and Palace barracks in Holywood provide accommodation and training facilities that are ready and waiting to be fully utilised&#8212;and, of course, we must not forget the facilities at Aldergrove, from which forces have already withdrawn. Again, the draw-down from Germany will provide scope for development.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.2/7">Those buildings are already intrinsic parts of the community. Officers in the barracks ensure that there is co-operation with young people, and with the community as a whole. It makes a great deal of sense to me&#8212;and, I know, to other Northern Ireland Members, who unfortunately are not present today&#8212;for facilities that are already available to be part of the 2020 plan for the Army, and I ask the MOD to give that serious consideration. I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.2/8">It is essential for the plan for the reserve forces to constitute 30% of Army numbers by 2018 to be realised through the use of the many troops that are currently trained and ready to go. Through the armed forces parliamentary scheme, I have had the opportunity&#8212;along with others, including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase>&#8212;to visit our base in Cyprus, and to note</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.2/9">the strategic importance of Cyprus in a very uncertain middle east. We need to be able to call upon fully trained and equipped personnel at any time, and I believe the reserves are a way to achieve that. Although these men and women are not in the Army full-time, they are trained to a very high standard. We must ensure the strength of the reserves does not diminish. We have built up expertise, and it should be utilised as needed. The reserves should form the foundation for the proposed changes, and the Northern Ireland reserve members are an important part of them. Given that, the Ministry of Defence must give commitments on Northern Ireland, as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and its role in respect of the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1083.2/10">Everywhere I go in the world, I always come across serving personnel from Northern Ireland with links to my constituency. Fellow members of the armed forces parliamentary scheme have observed that, and they have expressed amazement that there are always such connections. From Afghanistan to Canada, and from Kenya to the Falklands to Cyprus, there is always a Northern Ireland link, which illustrates the commitment of people in Northern Ireland to Queen and country and the principles of freedom and democracy.</p>

	<p pid="a.1085.0/1">The hon. Gentleman talks of a specific Northern Ireland perspective, and he is no doubt aware that recently the service chiefs met representatives of the political parties from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for the first time. His colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40428" name="Ian Paisley Jnr">the hon. Member for North Antrim (Ian Paisley)</phrase>, was present as was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40218" name="Elfyn Llwyd">the right hon.

	<p pid="a.1085.1/1">I entirely agree, and I would like the Minister to comment on that in his concluding remarks. The Northern Ireland link is clear and necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/2">I want to touch upon the importance of the Cyprus base. Cyprus has become a point of interest not only for Russia, but for China, and the strategic importance of Cyprus is underlined yet again by the fact that China wants to make Cyprus the base for its European operations. That is a small part of a bigger story.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/3">Our Cyprus base provides training for soldiers going to Afghanistan and for officers from Sandhurst, and it is essential that it is retained after any shake-up. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">The right hon. Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> mentioned soldiers coming home having a chance to unwind in Cyprus. It is a tremendous base and it has a major role to play in helping soldiers unwind from combat stress before going home.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/4">In these times of economic uncertainty, people are having to look outside the normal comfort zones to find work. There is therefore a rise in Army recruitment everywhere, but especially among nationalists, which speaks volumes about how the younger generation see themselves. When the main town in my constituency, Newtownards, celebrated the homecoming of the Irish Guards, one soldier remarked to me that when they were told that some in Belfast did not want them to parade there, they were bemused as some members of their regiment were Catholics and Belfast was their hometown. I was told that there was no real sense of</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/5">religion among the troops, and I know that to be the case: those who serve in the British Army are brothers, full stop.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/6">I am pleased that recruitment is up, especially as many young people will find not simply a pay packet but a vocation for life. That feature must be encouraged in any changes in the armed forces. I am all for the armed forces changing, and I ask the Minister to say something about the possibility of using the Northern Ireland bases to facilitate the draw-down from Germany. I am today putting down the mark for Northern Ireland and for her to play a major role in the future of the armed forces in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/7">Captain Wilfred Spender of the Ulster Division&#8217;s HQ staff was quoted in the press as saying after the battle of the Somme:</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/8">&#8220;I am not an Ulsterman but yesterday, the 1st July, as I followed their amazing attack, I felt that I would rather be an Ulsterman than anything else in the world. The Ulster Division has lost more than half the men who attacked and, in doing so, has sacrificed itself for the Empire which has treated them none too well. Their devotion, which no doubt has helped the advance elsewhere, deserved the gratitude of the British Empire. It is due to the memory of these brave fellows that their beloved Province shall be fairly treated.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1085.1/9">Can anything different be said of our troops today, and can the response from the MOD be any different?</p>

	<p pid="a.1086.0/1">Thirty years ago tonight, at eight minutes past 11, a massive explosion rocked my house. At the time, I was a major commanding A Company, 1st Battalion, The Cheshire Regiment. I rang the guardroom, because I was the duty field officer, and was told, &#8220;We think the Droppin&#8217; Well&#8212;the disco has been blown up.&#8221; I jumped into my car and was there within a minute. There was blackness where the Droppin&#8217; Well was meant to be&#8212;everything else was in light&#8212;and there was silence. I took a torch from my car and went into what was left of the building. The first person I met was a soldier who was only 18. He had a huge stomach and he was crying&#8212;not crying like a baby, but moaning. He was Private Mark Young, one of my youngest soldiers. I said to him, &#8220;You&#8217;ll be all right. You&#8217;ll live. Just stay there.&#8221; He had a broken back, although I did not know it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086.0/2">I went further on into the building and there I found another soldier, Private Harthern, who said, &#8220;Come over here, sir. Through that gap.&#8221; I looked through the gap and saw a girl called Tina Collins underneath the concrete. She was the wife of my clerk. She said, &#8220;I think Clinton isn&#8217;t moving sir.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t call me sir, it doesn&#8217;t matter. You&#8217;ve got to stay there, Tina.&#8221; I left Private Harthern with her. Lance Corporal Clinton Collins had been promoted by me that day. He and I had played squash until about 8 o&#8217;clock that night. I had taken him home and he had said, &#8220;In celebration, sir, I am taking Tina out for a drink.&#8221; But at eight minutes past 11 he was dead.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086.0/3">I went on, and a boy stood up and asked me whether I was a doctor. I looked like a doctor&#8212;I was wearing a coat. I said, &#8220;No, I am not a doctor.&#8221; He said, &#8220;She needs a doctor.&#8221; I looked down and saw a girl lying on the ground, entirely mashed&#8212;legs gone, arm a wreck. I knelt down beside her and said, &#8220;Are you all right?&#8221; She said, &#8220;I think so.&#8221; I said, &#8220;Oh.&#8221; She said, &#8220;What&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="a.1086.0/4">happened?&#8221; I said, &#8220;There&#8217;s been a bomb, darling.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Am I hurt?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Quite a bit.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Am I badly hurt?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes, you are.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Am I going to die?&#8221; I said, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; She said, &#8220;Will you hold me?&#8221; And I did. Of course, this young girl died. She died in a state of grace. She died fully conscious that she was dying. And, thankfully, she died with no pain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086.0/5">I then discovered that four of my soldiers who had been round a table were also hit. The first was dead and, rather like a pack of cards, after the first one had gone down the next one, who was on top of him, died in two hours and the third one died in three hours. The fourth, Lance Corporal William Bell, was trapped. I spoke to William Bell and eventually, when the doctors arrived, they said that they would have to cut his legs off because it had been four hours and the rule of thumb was that gangrene sets in in four hours. I said to him, &#8220;Corporal Bell, we are going to have to take your legs off.&#8221; He said, &#8220;One hell of a way to get out of the cross-country run, isn&#8217;t it, sir? No legs&#8212;good excuse for the regimental sergeant major.&#8221; He said it rather more in soldiers&#8217; language than that, but bearing in mind that we are in the Chamber of the House of Commons I have modified the language.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086.0/6">It was a hell of a night. Things got worse, of course, because in the morning I was ordered by the commanding officer to identify my soldiers. That took four hours in Altnagelvin hospital morgue. In total, I had six men killed and more than 30 wounded. Eleven soldiers died that night and six civilians, three of them girls and all of them young. Today is the 30th anniversary of Ballykelly. I have the honour and privilege to be going there this weekend to remember those people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086.0/7">Here is the point&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40080" name="Gisela Stuart">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase> is not in her seat, but she has already made it: we have a responsibility to look after people into the future. It is very easy to concentrate on just the Afghanistan casualties or, indeed, the Iraq casualties, but we have had a lot of casualties in the armed forces and among our civilian population over the years, particularly during the troubles in Northern Ireland, where I lost far more men than anywhere else. In a way, it is understandable that we forget that we have lost so many people because we are concentrating on seeing our brave men and women coming back from Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086.0/8">Some people might look and see the people who have been hurt in previous wars, perhaps in a wheelchair or something like that, and say that they are a relic of the past. They probably do not say that, but they might think it. Those people might well be a relic of the past, but they live in the past. It is the past that has condemned their future. After all, Mark Young is only 48 and Lance Corporal William Bell cannot be more than 50, so we have a responsibility to them. I am using them as examples, because many more soldiers require to be looked after. We as a Parliament and we as a people are doing great things for our servicemen and servicewomen who are hurt now. As we have heard this afternoon, they get treatment that is world-beating.</p>
	<p pid="a.1086.0/9">I finish by saying this: remember that we also have men and women from previous conflicts who require world-beating care for the rest of their lives.</p>

	<p pid="a.1088.0/1">I feel quite inadequate to follow the speech of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase>. He and I are both Members of Parliament representing south-east London constituencies. It would probably be fair to say that we have very different political views, but after listening to the speech that he has just made, some of those political views become somewhat irrelevant, given what he said about his own experience in the armed forces, and what he and many others who serve in the Army, the RAF and the Navy see with their own eyes. I feel very honoured and privileged to have listened to the speech that he gave.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/2">I shall make a brief contribution today. We have heard other speakers talk about important global issues relating to our defence forces, ranging from the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and their safety during that process to important aspects of the role of our defence forces in light of Britain&#8217;s emerging position in the world. I want to raise a specific issue about officers who are currently serving in our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/3">One of my constituents, Jayne Bullock, came to visit me a couple of months ago because her brother, who is a serving officer in the Army, had been issued with a redundancy notice earlier this year. He was given his redundancy date, which was only days before his immediate pension point. I understand that he will no longer be eligible to receive his pension immediately upon his redundancy, and that this represents a significant financial loss to him and his family. I understand that of the redundancy notices that were issued this summer, that situation affects about 70 or 80 serving officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/4">We heard from the hon. Member for Beckenham the vital job that such officers do in our armed forces. The responsibility that goes with being an officer in our Army cannot be underestimated. They have to deal with situations such as that which the hon. Gentleman described. It is only right that those officers are given the pension that they are due. I believe that the compensation that has been arranged for them in some form of lump sum falls far short of what they would have received, had they got their pension at their immediate pension point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/5">Will the Minister, in his concluding remarks, explain to hon. Members what he plans to do about this problem in the future? Although it affects a certain number of people who received their redundancy notices this summer, the problem will continue as there will be further tranches of redundancies. Would it be possible not to make redundant those people who are less then 12 months away from their immediate pension point?</p>
	<p pid="a.1088.0/6">We are all here today speaking highly of our armed forces, but we need more than warm words. We need to put our money where our mouth is. Will the Minister look into the issues raised by the Pension Justice for Troops campaign that Jayne Bullock has established, and look at what else might be possible in respect of providing those individuals with appropriate compensation? I hope that if not today, then at some point in the future, he will be able to offer those service personnel some good news.</p>

	<p pid="a.1089.0/1">I think that I speak for everyone present when I say that long after everything else that is said in this debate has been forgotten, everyone here today will remember the speech made by my hon. and gallant Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase>. It is easy to see from the bravery with which he recounted his experiences in Northern Ireland those qualities of character and courage that led to him being decorated as he was in other combat theatres.</p>
	<p pid="a.1089.0/2">Today we are talking primarily about defence personnel issues, but I know that you will allow a small degree of latitude, Mr Deputy Speaker. Therefore, before referring to the two main areas on which I wish to concentrate, I will make a couple of slightly wider points of gentle disagreement. I have a gentle disagreement with the Government on the idea that it is adequate for a country with United Kingdom&#8217;s interests to spend 2% or 2.1% of GDP on defence. It is simply not enough as a proportion. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40260" name="Jack Lopresti">the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Jack Lopresti)</phrase> said, if we can spend 0.7% of GDP on overseas aid, we should be spending more than 2% or 2.1% on defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1089.0/3">I have a very gentle disagreement with my right hon. Friend the Chair of the Defence Committee, who said that he now feels that it was right to name a date for withdrawal from Afghanistan because he can see the beneficial effects that it has had on the Afghan Government and Afghan forces in getting their act together. It is true that there has been a beneficial effect; there was always going to be. The effect we have to worry about is that which it will have on the enemy. They now know when we are going and that all they have to do is sit on their hands for long enough or, even worse, redouble their efforts to damage us in the run-up to our scheduled departure, in order to be able to claim that they drove us out of the country. Although I accept that there are some advantages in naming a departure date, I do not accept that it was the right thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1089.0/4">I will now turn to what I should have started with, defence personnel, which is the subject of the debate. I wish to concentrate on two areas, one general and one specific. The general area relates to veterans and the conditions they face on leaving the armed forces. In order to do that, I will draw heavily on comments made to me by Dr Hugh Milroy, the charismatic chief executive officer of one of the oldest and most respected welfare organisations, Veterans Aid, which is based in Victoria. It is so long in the tooth that if one looks at its website, one will find that its parent organisation, which was set up following the first world war, has a film clip featuring the late Ralph Richardson showing in fictional form the sorts of employment problems faced by someone coming back from that terrible conflict and the way in which voluntary organisations were necessary to give them a chance of resuming normal life. Indeed, the number of injured veterans was so large following that terrible war that there was inevitably a feeling of disillusionment about the way they were treated by a grateful country after 1918.</p>
	<p pid="a.1089.0/5">We have published the military covenant, and it has quite a bit to say about housing. I will read a couple of brief extracts. The covenant says that serving personnel</p>
	<p pid="a.1089.0/6">&#8220;should have priority status in applying for Government-sponsored affordable housing schemes, and Service leaders should retain this status for a period after discharge.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1089.0/7">It also says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1089.0/8">&#8220;Members of the Armed Forces Community should have the same access to social housing and other housing schemes as any other citizen, and not be disadvantaged in that respect by the requirement for mobility whilst in Service.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1089.0/9">The problem that arises is what a local authority does if it has no housing available and all it has is a waiting list.</p>

	<p pid="a.1090.0/1">Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that situation is exacerbated many times over if the local authority happens to have a major garrison within its borders?</p>

	<p pid="a.1090.1/1">I not only agree with the hon. Gentleman but pay tribute to him. I have listened year in, year out while he has raised this subject consistently in debate after debate. He is a champion of service personnel in relation to housing matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.1/2">I know something about this problem because I was recently approached in connection with the situation in the New Forest, a large part of which is protected, with very little available in the way of new housing. What happens if there is only a waiting list to offer to people? Should returning service personnel jump to the head of that waiting list over other people who have been on it for a considerable period? Dr Milroy says that his charity has seen many cases where individuals have taken a copy of the charter to the local authority,</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.1/3">&#8220;and the LA has laughed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.1/4">He says that the real problem is that</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.1/5">&#8220;if there are no available houses it is a pointless exercise. Until the Govt put resource behind this I can&#8217;t see things changing.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.1/6">Above all, he draws attention to the fact that we are heading for a &#8220;huge redundancy programme&#8221; that will result in a large increase in the numbers of ex- servicemen returning to civilian lives. Phrases such as &#8220;the emperor&#8217;s new clothes&#8221; feature in his remarks about the covenant, because, as he says, it is a fine idea but it will not change the situation unless backed by resources.</p>

	<p pid="a.1090.2/1">Given the challenges with service accommodation and some of the estates that we have, does my hon. Friend agree that there might be opportunities to introduce a right-to-buy scheme for armed forces families?</p>

	<p pid="a.1090.3/1">Yes, absolutely. I believe that the Government are working on schemes that will make it possible for ex-service personnel to get their foot on the housing ladder. I look forward to what I hope will be positive recommendations by the Minister on this subject.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1090.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="1090"  time="015:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0003.htm#12120641000203">
	<p pid="a.1090.4/1">I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman is aware that I started that scheme in the last four months of my time as veterans Minister, and the take-up showed that it was very popular.</p>

	<p pid="a.1090.5/1">I am delighted that there appears to be consensus across the House. Perhaps if the hon. Gentleman had been in post a little earlier than he was, he would have started the scheme a little earlier in Labour&#8217;s long period in office.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.5/2">On a more positive note, Dr Milroy and his organisation recently had a considerable success when the Government acknowledged and accepted their campaign saying that minor military disciplinary offences should no longer be allowed to count against Commonwealth soldiers who, after their period of service to this country, often in dangerous theatres, were applying for British residency and British citizenship. It was a massive injustice that issues that would normally be regarded in civilian life as minor infractions and not criminal in any way were being used by, I believe, the UK Border Agency, against the applications of individual Commonwealth servicemen or ex-servicemen to become British citizens. I am glad that Hugh Milroy and Veterans Aid mounted a successful, high-profile campaign and that the Government listened to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.5/3">Finally, I hope that the Government will be in similar listening mode with regard to a very high-profile case&#8212;I think I was the first MP to raise it on the Floor of the House&#8212;namely that of Special Air Service Sergeant Danny Nightingale. I am aware that the case is going to appeal on the question of conviction, so I will not stray into the issue of whether that appeal should succeed. I note with great pleasure that the appeal against sentence was successful and I was privileged to be present in the court. I thought it was absolutely grotesque to see a man of Sergeant Nightingale&#8217;s character and record in the barred dock of the court, but it was a great result that his sentence was reduced and suspended. He should never have been in custody in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.5/4">The only point I wish to make is that Ministers should bear in mind that if the appeal is successful&#8212;I say if&#8212;the question will arise of whether there should be a retrial. I hope that, if the appeal against conviction is successful, Ministers will have the good sense to say that enough is enough and to make that opinion clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.5/5">My mind goes back to one of the first service personnel campaigns that I was involved in when I came to this House in the late 1990s, namely the case of the two RAF Chinook pilots who were killed when their helicopter crashed into the Mull of Kintyre. That case dragged on and on, and for no good purpose. Lord Chalfont and others in the House of Lords, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40438" name="Menzies Campbell">the right hon. and learned Member for North East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell)</phrase> and my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40293" name="David Davis">the Member for Haltemprice and Howden (Mr Davis)</phrase> in this House, and, I would like to think, many of us&#8212;in my case on the Back Benches and later on the then Opposition Front Bench, where I held a role similar to that held today by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" name="Kevan Jones">the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones)</phrase>&#8212;pressed the case continuously. Our argument was that, given that the rules were changed after the crash so that no future pilots who were killed in a crash could ever be blamed in the way that they had been blamed, it was nonsensical and unfair that those whose case had led to the change in the rules should not benefit from it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.5/6">The same situation could well arise with Sergeant Nightingale. The Secretary of State for Defence has made it clear that he is considering&#8212;I hope that he will continue to consider it and, indeed, go ahead with it&#8212;an amnesty for other service personnel who have brought back and are holding on to, as trophies, weapons that should not still be in their possession. It would be absurd for the person whose trial had led to the</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.5/7">amnesty&#8212;we should also remember that an amnesty has already been held locally, which led to other members of the SAS handing in a lot of unauthorised weapons&#8212;not to be given the benefit of the fact that an amnesty was now available for everyone else.</p>
	<p pid="a.1090.5/8">I will close as I began by saying that anything that any of us has to say pales into minor significance compared with what we heard from my hon. and gallant Friend the Member for Beckenham. It was a privilege to be here during his speech.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1092.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40180" speakername="Bob Russell" colnum="1092"  time="016:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0003.htm#12120641000205">
	<p pid="a.1092.0/1">We are rightly praising members of Her Majesty&#8217;s armed forces for all that they do for our country. Representing the garrison town of Colchester, the home of 16 Air Assault Brigade, this debate perhaps has an added significance for me, because the Army is such an important part of the life of my constituency and the surrounding area. Colchester is proud to be a garrison town, proud of its Army&#8212;regulars and reservists&#8212;and delighted that it brings so much benefit to the local economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/2">However, we often do not express our appreciation for the army of civilians without whom the Army could not operate. I hope to make amends for that today. There are in excess of 1,000 jobs in Colchester that exist, directly or indirectly, because the Army is garrisoned in the town. Behind the 3,220 military personnel serving with HM armed forces at Britain&#8217;s most modern barracks, there is a civilian army of 280 Ministry of Defence civil servants. About 500 people are employed through the private finance initiative project under which the barracks was built a few years ago. There are also civilians who work for the Defence Support Group, which repairs and maintains a wide range of Army vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/3">The civilian work force at Merville barracks and within the Army housing areas include those involved in clerical, cleaning and catering work, property and grounds maintenance, housing support, welfare, retail outlets and the messes&#8212;which have my personal vote of approval, along with the Musket club&#8212;and security support. The latter are civilians, but they are civilians in uniform.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/4">In praising those who serve with the Ministry of Defence Police and Guarding Agency, I challenge the Minister to come clean this afternoon and say precisely what is the future of the Ministry of Defence police and the Ministry of Defence guard service? The number of MOD police officers covering the Colchester garrison was cut during the period of the last Labour Government from 33 to just three. Where once there was an MOD police presence throughout the Army housing areas, which have an estimated 3,000 dependants, wives and children, today the already over-stretched Essex constabulary has had the Army estates added to its workload. Army families tell me that the peace of mind that they once had is gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/5">The lifestyle of ethos and discipline that is part of everyday Army life is not necessarily shared by all the civilians who now occupy the former Army houses that were privatised by the last Conservative Government. The current owner, Annington Homes, has made a financial killing, to the detriment of the public purse, through sell-ons and by building new houses on former Army land, which they bought for virtually nothing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/6">I urge the coalition Government to reverse Labour&#8217;s cuts in the MOD police numbers at the Colchester garrison and to resist any moves to reduce, or close completely, the MOD guard service. From personal experience, I know that the guards provide a level of maturity and knowledge of security that would be lost if they were replaced on the gate by, for example, young soldiers or even a private security firm such as G4S. Let us keep the expertise and knowledge that the Ministry of Defence guard service provides.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/7">On a national perspective, will the Minister accept that further cuts to the MOD police would put at risk the security of important and strategic national assets for which the MOD police provide defensive armed policing as required? MOD police officers, unlike G4S for example, are authorised to carry arms outside the wire and have full constabulary powers, and the organisation has an investigative capability with its own criminal investigation department. Reducing the number of MOD police officers from 3,500 to about 2,600, as set out in the strategic defence and security review, is pure folly. National security interests must come before such cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/8">I referred briefly to the Defence Support Group, which in my youth was known as the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers workshops and a few years ago as the Army Base Repair Organisation. The name may have changed, but its professionalism at the Colchester site is worthy of the highest praise. I invite the Minister to pay a visit. Last month in the Colchester business awards, it came first in the class for active and sustainable travel. It has seen cycling to work rise from 7% to 16% in the past two years. It has six pool bikes that are well used, including by senior management, for business visits around the far-flung Colchester garrison area. How many pool bikes are there at the Ministry of Defence offices in Whitehall?</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/9">It is right that the families of our military personnel should also be praised. The establishment over the past year or so of the military wives choirs&#8212;there are now more than 50&#8212;has been a success story that has resonated with the British people, which gives an indication of the nation&#8217;s appreciation. The work of the inspirational Gareth Malone, through his programme on BBC television, has led to a national movement under the Military Wives Choirs Foundation, which was established by the military charity SSAFA Forces Help. This time last year, the original choir had just performed at the Royal British Legion festival of remembrance at the Royal Albert hall and was on its way to the top of the charts at Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/10">Three of the choirs have performed in the House of Commons, most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2012-11-07">7 November</phrase> when the Colchester military wives choir sang in the atrium of Portcullis House. Bookings have flooded in, and next Thursday evening it will perform a joint concert with the band of the Parachute Regiment at St Botolph&#8217;s church in Colchester. I will be there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/11">I am so proud of the Colchester choir. Travelling costs for its visit to Westminster were funded by the Colchester-based company Call Assist&#8212;an example of how local businesses support soldiers and their families in the same way as the community supports our soldiers. We witness that every Remembrance day when 3,000 people attend commemorations at the Colchester war memorial,</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/12">with a march along the high street before and afterwards. We remember those who died in past conflicts as well as more recent deaths in Afghanistan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/13">I take this opportunity to thank the Royal British Legion, ABF&#8212;the soldiers&#8217; charity, formerly known as the Army Benevolent Fund&#8212;Help for Heroes, and other military and service charities for the sterling work they do to help locally and nationally. I also wish to express my appreciation to Veterans Aid and Combat Stress for the special support they provide to former military personnel who have hit particularly personal difficult times.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/14">I am delighted that the Colchester military festival will return next year, and I am confident that it will attract some 20,000 members of the public as it did in the past. It is a fantastic showcase for the Army and I invite as many Defence Ministers as possible&#8212;and other hon. Members&#8212;to come and share the experience, which I am confident is without equal in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/15">Before I make my final point, I will repeat what I said previously. Families of our military personnel deserve a higher quality and condition of family housing than is often the case. Maintenance and modernisation programmes must not be delayed. That is a false economy as well as being damaging to the morale of those who live in such poor conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1092.0/16">Having paid tribute to our armed forces through personal experience and knowledge of the wider Army family in my constituency, participation in the armed forces parliamentary scheme, and membership of the Defence Committee, I must tell the Minister&#8212;quite bluntly&#8212;that cutting the size of Her Majesty&#8217;s armed forces is not in the national interest. He may remember that earlier this year I challenged the Prime Minister on that very point. The first duty of any Government is to defend the national interest at home and overseas. For that to be achieved, we must have armed forces to deal with situations that might arise. Reducing the size of the Army to its lowest level in 200 years is not in the national interest, and I will continue to argue that point.</p>

	<p pid="a.1094.0/1">I, too, congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40227" name="Damian Hinds">the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds)</phrase> on securing this debate, and thank the Backbench Business Committee for supporting it. It is a privilege to speak for two reasons. First, we have today the publication of the first ever armed forces covenant annual report, which I will read with interest when I eventually get down to Devon tonight. Secondly, I have the enormous privilege to represent Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport which, as hon. Members may know, is the home of 3 Commando Brigade, which saw action in Afghanistan a couple of years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/2">My constituency also contains the Haslar unit that deals with members of the armed services who have lost limbs and need assistance. It does an incredibly good job. My constituency and that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" name="Alison Seabeck">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck)</phrase> contain HMS Heroes, which looks after the children of service families and does a very good job. I share half of the original military wives choir with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40431" name="Nick Harvey">the hon. Member for North Devon (Sir Nick Harvey)</phrase>, and I am delighted that this</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/3">time last year I was able to play a small part in ensuring that VAT from the choir&#8217;s No. 1 hit, &#8220;Wherever you are&#8221;, was given to the Royal British Legion and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association. I am grateful that the Government did so much on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/4">I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> for making his visit later this weekend. Will he take our best wishes and thanks to family members who lost their loved ones in that appalling atrocity 30 years ago to the day? Only too often, we tend to forget the families.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/5">I want to talk about mental health, housing and reservists. This year, national armed forces day took place in Plymouth. It was used as an opportunity by the local authority to sign its community covenant, which is a useful thing. The covenant demonstrates that the town, which is one of the principal naval garrison towns in the country, the local authority and the whole community are keen to ensure that we thank those who serve. There is an enormous amount of emotional support for our armed services, especially our Royal Marines and Royal Navy, and we need to ensure that it continues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/6">We must not forget the partners and children of our armoured service personnel. They bear the brunt of dealing with the more complex issues. In many cases, they are the one group of people who immediately see that their husbands, wives or partners are suffering from mental health issues. They deal with it. Only when it becomes apparent can commanding officers pick up on it. When service personnel are called away on deployment, their partners&#8212;for want of a better expression&#8212;have to keep their families together and manage the household, including paying the bills and those kinds of things. They must also ensure that service personnel wind down and settle back when they return from deployment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/7">That can be difficult. I have told this story before, but I will tell it again because it is an important one. The reservists were on exercises and training on Woodbury common, which is in the constituency of the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40224" name="Hugo Swire">the Member for East Devon (Mr Swire)</phrase>. I asked one of them how he was getting on. He said, &#8220;Fine, but when I came back from Afghanistan and I went to my wife and my family home up in Aylesbury&#8221;&#8212;he lived away from his base&#8212;&#8220;she said, &#8216;Don&#8217;t start talking to me about all the problems you&#8217;ve got. I&#8217;ve had a horrendous day. I&#8217;ve answered 300 e-mails today.&#8217;&#8221; Perhaps she works for a Member of Parliament, but he said to her, &#8220;I&#8217;ve was under mortar fire for eight hours during my time in Afghanistan.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/8">The reservist found it difficult to communicate to his wife on the subject, and he also had difficulty speaking to his civilian mates. Only fellow Royal Marines were able to take on board what he said and had that common interest. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40260" name="Jack Lopresti">the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Jack Lopresti)</phrase> had similar experiences when he came back from deployment. We must ensure that we continue to work very hard on delivering our mental health strategy in line with &#8220;Fighting Fit&#8221;, which was produced by the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40562" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison)</phrase>&#8212;what a good job he did!</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/9">However, we have more to do. We must ensure that our reservists can access much needed support. If we do not, we are letting people down. During my visit to HMS Haslar, I was told by the Royal Marines that they had done an enormous amount of work on trauma risk management, or TRiM. I was impressed, although my hon. Friends who speak about the Army might have a different view. We had a breakfast in Parliament, where the Royal Marines described the professional job they do to help some of their younger people through combat stress&#8212;I suspect it was called shell shock or similar in my grandfather&#8217;s day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/10">On my visit to HMS Haslar, I heard about Q fever, an illness that some end up having, and how difficult people find it to access support and funding. I am delighted to read in the report on the covenant that the Government have taken on board the Care Quality Commission&#8217;s report, to establish a unified Ministry of Defence primary health care. I hope GPs will be given training so they understand what is going on, especially in places such as Plymouth, to which many servicemen and women return. Some GPs do not have the training in mental health that they need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/11">On housing, before I was elected to this place I came across an officer in the Coldstream Guards who told me that during his deployment&#8212;in Iraq, I think&#8212;he had called his wife for a 45-minute conversation. The conversation began with his wife spending a good 30 minutes talking about how a leak in the roof had totally ruined the sofa that they had bought on credit, and that left him only 15 minutes to talk about their children and parents. We have to ensure that we look after accommodation, and the Government have done well to make significant changes. In 2008, a third of Navy personnel said they were satisfied with the quality of housing, leaving two thirds who were not. Under-25s and single people were also unhappy with their housing. We need to ensure that housing is modernised, and I would welcome an extension of the right-to-buy scheme for military personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/12">My final point is about reservists. From conversations I have had with Royal Marines, I know that they are concerned about training and whether they will be deployed as a unit or individually. If we are going to reduce our regular forces and make greater use of our reservists, it is important that they are given proper training and decompression activity when they come back. Let me make this final point, too. Reservists do not necessarily live on camp; they often live elsewhere, and so their opportunity to talk to their wives or fellow reservists is limited. We need to ensure that our reservists are better informed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/13">Finally, I completely agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40080" name="Gisela Stuart">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase> on how important it is that as a country we are not sea blind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1094.0/14">My final point&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Laughter</i> <i>]&#8212;</i>concerns <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40409" name="Angus Robertson">the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase>, so I am delighted that he is back in the Chamber. I wonder whether he and the Scottish National party are sending a confusing message. They want services in Scotland, but if it gains independence they want to get rid of the submarines and the naval bases.</p>

	<p pid="a.1097.0/1">I was tempted to say &#8220;Finally&#8221;, Mr Deputy Speaker. I draw the House&#8217;s attention to my interest as a member of the reserve forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097.0/2">It is appropriate that I started today in Portsmouth at the rededication service of the Falklands memorial plantation on Portsdown hill. It is right that we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice, acknowledge the courage and professionalism of all those involved in securing that victory and celebrate their legacy. We should do the same for our armed forces in Afghanistan. I know that not all Members agree with our mission in Afghanistan, but, whether we are pro or anti, we must acknowledge not only the skills, courage and professionalism of our armed forces, but their achievements &#8212;and not only those achievements in the area of our own national security.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097.0/3">I was in Afghanistan last week with the Defence Committee. While in Lashkar Gah, we had the privilege of meeting members of the provincial peace council. We saw a town that had new schools, including girls&#8217; schools, and whose new governor was in India at a cotton expo, and around us were car lots, wedding shops and all sorts of businesses springing up. We were patting them on the back for their remarkable achievements, but their response was clear. They said, &#8220;These achievements are not ours. They are the achievement of your brave armed forces.&#8221; They have created the security, space and stability for those lasting changes to occur. I wonder whether, if we added up everything we all might achieve in our long&#8212;in my case short&#8212;political careers, it would ever come close to the achievement of our troops out there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097.0/4">Our troops have achieved something else. This is a subtler point. The presence of such professional, diverse and well respected forces has changed for ever the view of the Afghan people of what it means to wear a uniform. When we were out there, President Karzai said that no rich men&#8217;s sons were in the Afghan army, but I think that will change because of the presence of our armed forces. We need to talk about that, especially as transition takes place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097.0/5">We also need to tell our troops that. While I was in Lashkar Gah, I visited a forward operating base called Sparta. Speaking to Afghans in the neighbouring base, I learned that the further away they were from centres of communication in Kabul and Bastion, the less they knew about the achievements being made. We should be putting those achievements on paper-based communications to our troops, perhaps even on their daily or weekly orders. I raised that point before I left the country, and I hope that the Minister will take it up. I can give him a head start: I think that Radio 1 is broadcasting from Afghanistan next week. I hope he will phone up and give a long list of our armed forces&#8217; achievements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097.0/6">That leads me on to communications. This is a time of immense change for our armed forces, and there are complex personnel issues that have to be dealt with. The MOD has an extremely good internal communications plan, but it is no good if that information cannot be accessed in a timely fashion. There is a problem with people being able to access joint personnel administration, because there are too few secure computer terminals in units. That issue has been raised many times with me,</p>
	<p pid="a.1097.0/7">and I am not just talking about the reserves. Surprisingly, not everyone has a personal e-mail account&#8212;I met several sergeant-majors in Bastion who did not have one&#8212;so it is difficult to get information to people quickly. If we want our armed forces to respond to consultation, especially if they are on JPA, we must do better.</p>
	<p pid="a.1097.0/8">The other communications issue I wish to touch on is a localised one to do with Afghanistan and Camp Bastion in particular. During Operation Herrick 9, our armed forces had free access to the internet, and although they have some access now, it is limited and they have to pay $90 a month to access wider broadband services, such as those that allow them to Skype their family. I raised this issue before I left the country. It is being looked into, but I am sure the Minister will want to know what can be done, especially as transition continues and welfare issues get pared down, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> pointed out. Being able to Skype back home will become even more important as troops pull out. I hope the Minister takes that on board.</p>

	<p pid="a.1098.1/1">I am sorry; I am very short on time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.1/2">On welfare services, I pay tribute to all who support and honour our armed forces, particularly&#8212;I hope hon. Members forgive me; I have my Portsmouth hat on&#8212;the Naval Families Federation and the Royal Navy and Royal Marines charities, which do an amazing job. I want to raise with the Minister again the Service Complaints Commissioner. The role needs to become an ombudsman. We need to review the rules that categorise a complaint as an employee grievance&#8212;if the person making a complaint is killed in action, it is dropped and not pursued. I urge the Minister to make best use of Dr Susan Atkins while she is still in post. She has done a tremendous job. He should encourage her to do the review that she wants to do before she goes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.1/3">I pay tribute to our armed forces. We do not talk about them enough in this place&#8212;actually, we never could&#8212;but at least we have had the opportunity to do that today.</p>

	<p pid="a.1098.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the right hon. Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> and the Backbench Business Committee on selecting this afternoon&#8217;s debate. Let me put on record everyone&#8217;s thanks and tributes to the members of our armed forces and their families, who are an integral part of the defence of our country. I also agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40180" name="Bob Russell">the hon. Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell)</phrase> about the army of civil servants and civil contractors, without whose support we could not deploy forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.2/2">There have been 11 very good contributions to today&#8217;s debate. The right hon. Member for North East Hampshire talked about Afghanistan. I agree that the deadline has focused minds in Afghanistan; my concern is about what role UK armed forces will play post-2014. There is a naive assumption that a training role will be without its dangers, but the people performing training roles with the embedded teams in Iraq were in harm&#8217;s way. We need clarification from the Government on that</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.2/3">before 2014, because people will be in harm&#8217;s way. We also need to know what our armed forces&#8217; footprint will be in Afghanistan post-2014.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.2/4">The right hon. Gentleman also talked about the Service Complaints Commissioner, as did <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40485" name="Penny Mordaunt">the hon. Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt)</phrase>. This was a tremendous success for the Defence Committee, following its report on the duty of care in the last Parliament, although I agree with the hon. Lady that the next step needs to be some type of ombudsman&#8212;a proposal that was in the original report to give the post teeth. I, too, pay tribute to the Service Complaints Commissioner, who has done a first-rate job in not only highlighting and dealing with complaints, but getting the trust of senior members of the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.2/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40080" name="Gisela Stuart">the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase> raised the issue of medical support for our armed forces. She, like me, was heavily criticised at the time for the closure of Army, Navy and RAF-dedicated hospitals, but in hindsight it was the right thing to do. She rightly paid tribute to the Queen Elizabeth hospital and the investment that has gone into it, as well as the dedicated NHS staff working closely alongside the military personnel, breaking new ground not only with new surgical techniques but by keeping people alive who even a matter of years ago would not have survived, as she rightly said. However, I have concerns about how the NHS integrates with the Army recovery capability&#8212;which she also raised&#8212;which is something I am glad the Government are committed to. We need to ensure a seamless transition into civilian life for those people, and that they get the appropriate NHS care once they have left the armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.2/6">My hon. Friend made some interesting points about finance in relation to the strategic defence and security review. No one will be surprised when I reiterate that the SDSR was not a defence review but a budget-led, Treasury-led review. As a nation, we need to ask what our role is in the world. That was not done as part of the SDSR, as it was led by the Treasury. That led to some of the mistakes that are now being unpicked as the new Secretary of State tries to get to grips with the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.2/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40260" name="Jack Lopresti">The hon. Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Jack Lopresti)</phrase> talked about the defence budget. The Government keep pushing the myth that they started with a &#163;38 billion black hole, even though no one has yet been able to explain the calculations behind that figure. The original National Audit Office report said that there would be a &#163;6 billion black hole if the budget continued on its present basis. The only way of arriving at a figure of &#163;36 billion would be to add flat cash over 10 years and to include everything in the equipment programme. That still leaves an unexplained extra &#163;2 billion. Members will be pleased to know that I am now on Twitter, and I had an interesting exchange last night with the former Minister for defence procurement, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40399" name="Peter Luff">the hon. Member for Mid Worcestershire (Peter Luff)</phrase>, who told me that the figure was even higher than &#163;38 billion. If that is the case, why do we not know what it actually is?</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.2/8">That brings me to the Ministry of Defence&#8217;s annual report and accounts, which make great reading. It is interesting that claims by the previous and present Secretaries of State to have balanced the budget are</p>
	<p pid="a.1098.2/9">nowhere to be seen in the introduction. It will also come as no surprise that the accounts for this year have been qualified.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.1100.0/1">May I gently draw the attention of the shadow Minister to the fact that the accounts were qualified in every year under the last Labour Government as well?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1100.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40434" speakername="Kevan Jones" colnum="1100"  time="016:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0003.htm#12120641000213">
	<p pid="a.1100.1/1">I acknowledge that, but I did not make wild claims about somehow having magicked away a &#163;38 billion black hole in two years, which the Secretary of State is now doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/2">The hon. Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke mentioned Defence Equipment and Support, and I agree with him that there is uncertainty in that regard that needs early resolution. He might be interested to know that the accounts show that the average length of time that the MOD equipment programme was delayed in 2010-11 was 0.46 months, and that the figure has now increased to 5.5 months. No great progress has been made in the efficiency of the delivery of that programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/3">Another startling fact to emerge from the annual report and accounts is that the Department has not received approval for the remuneration package for the Chief of Defence Mat&#233;riel, who is earning considerably more than the Prime Minister. It has been suggested that the Department has somehow acted outside its authority in this regard. We need clarification of some of the issues raised in the annual report and accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/4">We keep being promised an explanation of the Secretary of State&#8217;s assertion that the defence budget is now in balance. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-14">14 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-11">11 June</phrase>, he told the House that he would shortly publish the figures, and he told the Defence Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2012-07-12">12 July</phrase> that the NAO report would be published in September and that it would explain exactly how he had balanced the budget. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40417" name="Patrick Mercer">The hon. Member for Newark (Patrick Mercer)</phrase> raised an interesting point about this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/5">Yesterday, during the Chancellor&#8217;s statement, it was mentioned almost as an aside that defence had somehow got off lightly, given the further 1% cuts that other Departments were being asked to make&#8212;but that is not the case. It will have to swallow cuts of its own, and, according to <i>The Daily Telegraph</i> today, that will involve another &#163;1.3 billion coming out of defence. It is important that we get clarification of this so-called balancing of the budget, when it is clearly not in balance. We also need an explanation of where the original figure of &#163;38 billion came from.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/6">The reason that is important is that members of our armed forces and their families know that we are in tough times and that they have to take some share of the pain. What they do not want to see, however, are spurious figures and spurious claims made to justify some of what is being done. There are only two ways of getting money quickly out of the defence budget: either by cutting the number of personnel or by cutting in-year programmes, leaving capability gaps, which is what the strategic defence and security review has done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40409" name="Angus Robertson">The hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase> made some points about Germany and rebasing. We have been promised a statement next week, so it will be interesting to see whether that comes forward. I thought it completely bonkers when the right hon. Member for</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/8">North Somerset (Dr Fox) made the announcement. I looked at the issue when I was a Minister, so I know that four years ago the price tag was &#163;3.5 billion&#8212;but where that is coming from, I do not know. It is important to have clarification not only for the reasons that the right hon. Gentleman gave regarding communities and individuals here, but because we must know what is actually happening for our servicemen and women along with civil servants, educationists and others based in Germany. If the cost was &#163;3.5 billion then, it is surely a lot higher today. It is not just about bringing people back, as it is also about evaluating the costs of withdrawal&#8212;environmental and other costs that will be added to the clean-up of those areas. Under the treaty with the Germans, it is quite clear that two years&#8217; written notice has to be given, but I am not aware that that has happened. I do not mind if the Government have changed their policy on this issue, but they should say so, as we do not want the uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/9">The hon. Member for Moray spoke about the so-called future Scottish armed forces, claiming that they will comprise 15,000. I am not sure what type of role they will take: if they are to be in NATO, what would they deploy? Will the army act as a border force to stop riotous Northumbrians crossing the border? Will there be a navy of fishing boats? Will the air force be of gliders? In this debate, it is important for the Scottish National party not only to deal with the present lay-down of armed forces, as the hon. Gentleman has, but to be honest with people and say what the future defence structure would look like in an independent Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/10">I join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40455" name="James Gray">the hon. Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray)</phrase> in paying tribute to Wootton Bassett and to Sir Neil Thorne. I also commend the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s role on the marching parades, which have been supported across the parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/11">I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" name="Jim Shannon">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase> for his quite proper recognition of the contribution of people from Northern Ireland to the armed forces. I visited Northern Ireland when I was a Minister, and I was very impressed by the dedication I found there to all three of our armed forces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/12">I know that on many occasions <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> adopts a light-hearted approach in his contributions to the House. Today, however, he made a very serious contribution, which I think shows the House of Commons at its best. He paid tribute to the victims of the Droppin&#8217; Well bombing. It must have been very difficult for him to relive some of those experiences today, so I pay tribute to him for doing so. He is right that 30 years seems a long time ago, but not for him and the people who were there. Speaking as he did in this debate greatly honours those people and pays a fitting tribute to their memories. I hope that his contribution gives some comfort to those who were injured in the ways he described and to the families, relatives and friends of those who lost their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/13">The hon. Member for Beckenham mentioned another matter, and his position was the same as mine when I was veterans Minister. It is fine to get things right now for veterans and those injured in conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. My concern, in common with the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s, is what happens to these people in 20, 30 or 40 years&#8217; time. We, as a society and a nation, owe a great debt of gratitude to those individuals. Irrespective of our political parties, we need to ensure that that</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/14">remains the case. I hope that the work with service charities in relation to the Army recovery capability scheme, which is in the pipeline, involves something of that joined-up approach, but we shall have to monitor this on a yearly basis. We shall need to look after the people to whom the hon. Gentleman referred&#8212;who are already injured as a result of service in Afghanistan and Iraq&#8212;when they are older. There can be no &#8220;if&#8221; or &#8220;but&#8221;; we must do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/15">When it comes to housing&#8212;the favourite subject of the hon. Member for Colchester&#8212;we must ensure that we continue to listen to the views of the British Armed Forces Federation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1100.1/16">Let me end by saying that it is always good to hear such well-informed contributions, and by again paying tribute to our brave servicemen and women.</p>

	<p pid="a.1102.0/2">My right hon. Friend the Member for North East Hampshire, the Chairman of the Select Committee, raised several issues. Let me deal briefly with one of them, which was also raised by other Members. It concerned the Service Complaints Commissioner. I met Dr Atkins recently to discuss how we could help her to perform her very independent role. I hope that the dialogue on which we have embarked will prove productive, and I look forward to meeting her again in the new year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/3">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40485" name="Penny Mordaunt">the Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt)</phrase> on her recent commissioning as a sub-lieutenant in the Royal Naval Reserve. In debates such as this, it is always reassuring to know that the Royal Navy is sitting behind me, particularly as my father served in the Royal Navy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/4">I thank my Essex colleague, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40180" name="Bob Russell">the Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell)</phrase>, for his contribution. He raised a range of issues, and, as usual, he had a long wish list. I can tell him that I was present when the Colchester Military Wives Choir performed in Portcullis House, and that I thanked them at the end of their performance. I visited Colchester garrison about a year ago, as a member of the Committee that dealt with the Bill that became the Armed Forces Act 2011, thus helping to enshrine the key principles of the covenant in law. I have met representatives of the Defence Police Federation and trade union representatives of the Ministry of Defence Guard Service, and I hope to return to Colchester early in the new year. I hope that that satisfies the hon. Gentleman, at least for the moment. I will not mention the meeting that I had with him at the MOD yesterday on a different topic.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/5">This debate falls on the day on which we publish the first annual report on the armed forces covenant, which is a subject of great importance and should be given due regard. For too long we may have sometimes taken for granted the special nature of military service: a willingness, if necessary, to lay down one&#8217;s life for one&#8217;s country. I echo the tributes that have been paid to the extremely moving and powerful speech made by my hon. Friend</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase>, who reminded us of the tragedy of the Ballykelly bombing 30 years ago. I am sure that he will do good service when he returns to commemorate that very difficult anniversary at the weekend.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/7">Let me also remind the House, if it needs reminding, that today, as I speak, men and women are on patrol in Afghanistan, helping to keep us safe from terrorism at home. We must and will go the extra mile for them for their families, and for the roughly one in 10 adults in the United Kingdom who are veterans. That is a very important statistic.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" name="Jim Shannon">The hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase> also mentioned the covenant. We had a very good debate about it in the House last month. Let me update the hon. Gentleman on the points that were raised. There is a difficulty with local authorities in Northern Ireland signing the community covenant because it could be argued in some quarters that it conflicts with equalities legislation. That point was made powerfully in the debate. We have now formed a working group of officials from the MOD and the Northern Ireland Office to try to find a way through the difficulty, and I know that the hon. Gentleman and others are to have a meeting with the Prime Minister fairly shortly. We will do our best to come up with a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/9">It is simply unacceptable that past or present service personnel should be denied equal access to the services on which we all depend. Creating a fair deal for our armed forces past and present is at the core of the armed forces covenant. That is why in the Armed Forces Act 2011 this Government enshrined in law the two key principles of the covenant: that it is desirable to remove disadvantages arising as a result of service or former service; and that special provision for service personnel and their families may be justified to mitigate the effects of service, especially for the wounded or bereaved. I believe we are making a good start, but it is arrogant in the extreme to believe we can solve the many long-standing issues&#8212;some of which have been raised by Members this afternoon&#8212;in a single year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/10">Today&#8217;s first statutory report covers progress over the full scope of the armed forces covenant, including the four fields specified in the 2011 Act: health care, education, housing and the operation of inquests. I shall address each in turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/11">On health care, the covenant has a particular resonance for those who have suffered injuries or health problems in the service. The importance we place on this is exemplified by the sign above the door of Colonel Kevin Beaton, commanding officer of the Royal College of Defence Medicine in Birmingham:</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/12">&#8220;The military patient, their Family and their Unit, we call our &#8216;Patient Group&#8217;. They are the most important people in The Royal Centre for Defence Medicine Clinical Unit. It is our privilege to be entrusted with the care and support of our Patient Groups on behalf of an indebted nation. We are not doing them a favour by looking after them. They are the reason we are here. Proudly serving them provides the overriding purpose behind all we do. They are our Main Effort.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/13">I can think of no finer way of expressing that sentiment, and I hope all Members agree with it, not least <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40080" name="Gisela Stuart">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart)</phrase>, as she has the privilege of having that unit in her constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/14">I take medical treatment for our armed forces personnel very seriously. In the three months I have been in post, I have sought to learn as much as possible about the medical support we provide to them. I have visited the Role 3 hospital at Camp Bastion, the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham, the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court, the personnel recovery centre at Tedworth house&#8212;run by that wonderful charity, Help for Heroes&#8212;and the headquarters of Defence Medical Services near Lichfield. Most recently, I had the honour to participate in a game of wheelchair basketball at the new Battle Back centre at Lilleshall, which I helped to open, and I can attest that fighting spirit and competitiveness are still present in abundance when that sport is played; I still have the blisters on my hands to prove it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/15">In the course of those visits, I have seen the medical process end to end, and I can say with confidence that the treatment we provide to injured personnel is world class, a sentiment that I know is shared by, among others, our American counterparts. Wherever they are in the world, the men and women who provide this care should be immensely proud that the Care Quality Commission described the provision as exemplary. It is.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/16">On education, the pledges made in the covenant are being well received by schools and service families alike. The Department for Education allows infant schools to increase class sizes beyond 30 to admit the children of service personnel. Where resources permit, admissions authorities also have the flexibility to give priority admission to these children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/17">Oxfordshire county council has altered its schools admissions policy, allowing places to be allocated to children of service families in advance of a posting, based on a letter from the relevant unit. That is a small change, but it has a very big impact, as it gets around the Catch-22 that people cannot apply for a school place until they have moved to an area, and if they move after the beginning of the school year they are caught. We have changed the rules, and this change is being mirrored by a number of local education authorities around the country, with the backing of the Department for Education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/18">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40415" name="Julian Lewis">the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis)</phrase>, the hon. Member for Colchester and others raised the subject of housing, and it remains a key issue for the armed forces community. Today&#8217;s report points to areas of progress, but also acknowledges that more needs to be done. Some 94% of accommodation for service families is in the top two of four categories. The single living accommodation modernisation programme has delivered almost 5,000 modernised, en-suite rooms in 2011-12, and we are on track to meet our target of 50% of trained personnel being housed in the highest standard of accommodation by March 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/19">In parallel, we are encouraging service families to explore the choice of owning their own home. Armed forces personnel have been placed at the top of the priority list for all Government-funded home ownership schemes, and service leavers retain that status for up to 12 months after leaving. The level of home ownership among service families has risen from 55% to 60% over the past two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/20">Next I shall deal with the operation of inquests. Tragically, operations in Afghanistan have shown, once again, that members of our armed forces can face</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/21">mortal danger. Above all else, that is why we owe them not only our respect, but the peace of mind that we will care for their families in the event of their death. We should do everything to ensure that the plight of grieving families is not compounded by inadequacies in helping them to understand the circumstances in which their loved ones died. I am encouraged that waiting times for coroners&#8217; inquests have been falling since 2003, including under the previous Government, and maintaining that trend will be a priority. This year, the Government fulfilled their pledge to appoint a chief coroner&#8212;we appointed Peter Thornton&#8212;and to publish a new national charter for the coroner service. I will meet Mr Thornton on <phrase class="date" code="2012-12-18">18 December</phrase> to discuss how the Ministry of Defence can assist him further in what we agree is vital work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/22">Steps have also been taken in a number of additional areas to uphold the values and ideals of the covenant. We recognise, for example, that the process of adapting to civilian life can be daunting. Through the career transition partnership, the MOD provides outstanding career support to service leavers, with the result that 97% of those who use that service will find employment within 12 months. That is an impressive record.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/23">We also encourage local authorities to appoint armed forces champions as a voice within local government, where a great many pledges within the covenant are delivered. In this regard, I am delighted to report to the House that some 230 local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales have signed the community covenant&#8212;this is spreading like a benign virus&#8212;and I sincerely hope that almost all will have done so by Remembrance day next November.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/24">As announced recently in this House, the new defence discount service will offer a membership card allowing members to access a range of discounts from companies such as Vodafone, Vue Cinemas and Vision Express. I was delighted to join the Prime Minister yesterday to present cards to a number of veterans and serving personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/25">I also wish to express my gratitude for the contribution of the covenant reference group, which includes voluntary and charitable bodies, private organisations and individuals. The Government committed themselves to publishing the external members&#8217; observations verbatim, alongside the annual report, and today we uphold that promise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/26">Of particular concern to the families federations is service accommodation. They comment that the</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/27">&#8220;availability of Service Families Accommodation in some areas is insufficient&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/28">and that</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/29">&#8220;higher priority must be given to maintaining and enhancing the quality of all Service-provided accommodation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/30">To many service families, a decent home is the physical embodiment of the covenant. We are working to address these concerns, and I hope we will be in a position to provide further information to the House in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/31">Members of the reference group acknowledged the high priority given to the covenant by the Prime Minister, the Cabinet Office and the MOD. The appointment of a chief coroner was described as being &#8220;hugely significant&#8221; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/32">&#8220;of real long-term benefit to bereaved Armed Forces families&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/33">There is praise also for our progress in addressing disadvantage for armed forces children and in providing better support to deployed personnel and their families. Most encouraging to me is the observation that the covenant is changing attitudes to the armed forces community.</p>
	<p pid="a.1102.0/34">I must allow the Chairman of the Select Committee back in, so I shall draw my remarks to a close. The armed forces covenant is a work in progress, an ongoing pledge that has support from those in all parts of the House. Each and every year we will come before this House with, to borrow a military term, a &#8220;SitRep&#8221;, giving a state of play on the covenant and our obligations under it. While I hold this post, I am absolutely determined that we will demonstrate real progress year on year, put flesh on the bones of the covenant and honour the people to whom we owe so much.</p>

	<p pid="a.1106.0/1">With the leave of the House, Mr Deputy Speaker, may I start my contribution, after a debate in which it has been a great privilege to take part, on a note of disagreement? In a year in which we have celebrated Her Majesty&#8217;s diamond jubilee and the greatest Olympics the world has ever seen, I must disagree with the suggestion of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40080" name="Gisela Stuart">the hon.

	<p pid="a.1107.2/1">As chair of the Unite the Union group in Parliament and of the all-party group on health and safety, I have spent most of my working life in politics standing up for people who have been disadvantaged because of the career they have chosen. As Major Cameron March MBE, from the Army&#8217;s operational stress management team, recently said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.2/2">&#8220;If we put people into difficult places we&#8217;ve got to have something in place to look after them&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.2/3">That is true in all walks of life, whether we are dealing with builders exposed to asbestos, lorry drivers travelling over long hours or, as I will speak about this evening, service personnel exposed to traumatic experiences. The issue I have brought to the House today seems to me to be an extreme example of occupational health and safety. As employers, we have a responsibility to those brave individuals to ensure they can live a fulfilling life following their service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.2/4">I was delighted to read in one of the tabloid papers today that the Prime Minister has announced &#163;1 million for veterans&#8217; charities. I would like to say, &#8220;It was this debate wot done it&#8221;, but something inside tells me that another event is taking place tonight that has been organised by one of the tabloid papers. The &#163;1 million is welcome and I am sure the veterans will appreciate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.2/5">Post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD as it is now known, is not a new phenomenon. It was first identified during the first world war, and was called &#8220;shell shock&#8221;. We have moved on since then and correctly recognise that it is a serious condition that in no way undermines the brave work undertaken by our armed forces. Despite that, there is still a significant stigma attached to mental health issues among veterans. Many still consider themselves &#8220;weak&#8221; if they suffer in the adjustment to civilian life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.2/6">A culture change among veterans is needed, but for policymakers that is difficult to achieve. However, if the Government direct more funding to the condition, which is what I shall argue for today, we can give hope to those suffering and help them to recognise that they are not weak and that the condition is a natural reaction to the horrors they have seen.</p>

	<p pid="a.1107.4/1">I am not aware of the precise details, but I am extremely disappointed to hear that. I am sure that the Minister will address that when he gets the opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.4/2">My right hon. colleague, the Minister for the Armed Forces, has said that he</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.4/3">&#8220;takes the issue of mental health very seriously, and we recognise that operational deployments will inevitably expose personnel to stressful experiences.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2012-06-12.447"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 June 2012; Vol. 546, c. 447W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.4/4">Similarly, when he was a Health Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40161" name="Simon Burns">the right hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns)</phrase>, claimed that the coalition Government</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.4/5">&#8220;considers the health and wellbeing of&#8230;armed forces personnel, veterans and their families to be a top priority.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2012-06-18.801"><i>Official Report</i>, 18 June 2012; Vol. 546, c. 801W</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1107.4/6">I agree with these sentiments, as I am sure we all do. Those veterans have put their lives on the line so that we can be safe. They have done a great service for their country and they deserve the top service from their country in return. So why then do the actions of Ministers not speak louder than their words? Their statements are commendable, but their funding commitments are not. I am calling today for more public funding to be directed to the issue and for the psychological well-being of our veterans to be considered a top priority.</p>

Gentleman referred to the great work done by charitable organisations &#8212;for instance, SSAFA Forces Help, the Army Benevolent Fund, the Royal British Legion, Help for Heroes and many others. Would it be more constructive if the Government were to work with those charitable organisations to address the problem?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1108.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40473" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="1108"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0004.htm#12120641000220">
	<p pid="a.1108.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that contribution. I will come to that important aspect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/2">It is important that we tackle the issue now as we are only a few years away from it becoming more serious. The Prime Minister confirmed at the end of November that the combat mission in Afghanistan will end in 2014. With this will come the return of thousands of troops who have been serving abroad so that we can remain safe in our own country. Combat Stress estimates that 7,600 of the 191,000 personnel who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan could develop PTSD, and that 37,600 are suffering from other disorders, such as depression, mood disorders and anxiety. It could be up to 13 years before the problems reveal themselves, so work done now in this area could prove invaluable 10 to 15 years down the line.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/3">However, we should not be alarmist. Most British military personnel do not suffer any mental health problems while in service or afterwards. We also cannot be certain that the numbers of personnel suffering from mental health issues are disproportionate to the population as a whole. There are conflicting views on this. I have spoken to Veterans Aid, which says that there is no problem with ex-service personnel care, yet PTSD Resolution, a charity that gives counselling to veterans, talks about a much larger problem that is not currently acknowledged. The Royal British Legion anticipates a growing number of problems due to the rebalancing of the armed forces towards reservists.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/4">With more and more armed forces coming back from Afghanistan, the possibly low estimate of 4% of personnel with probable PTSD, 19.7% with other mental disorders and 13% with unhealthy relationships with alcohol will become a much larger problem. I say possibly low estimate because the United States&#8217; estimates of its defence personnel with PTSD range from 12% to 20%. Whether our figures are low or not, all personnel suffering from PTSD and other mental health issues deserve the highest quality post-deployment support services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/5">I find it a huge cause for concern that these services are at present undertaken, by and large, by charities. They rely on the generosity of the public and in the current environment, where donations to charities are down by 20%, according to the Office for National Statistics, we cannot go on in this way. Let me provide some examples. The Big White Wall online support network is propped up by a &#163;100,000 commitment from Help for Heroes. That is almost a third of its total funding. Combat Stress, a veterans charity, is currently supporting over 5,000 veterans aged from 20 to 101 and it says it</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/6">&#8220;simply couldn&#8217;t do what we do without the generosity of the great British public.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/7">PTSD Resolution provides counselling to UK veterans, with a 78% success rate, but gets no recognition for its work from the MOD. Erskine hospital in my constituency provides vital care to veterans suffering from mental health issues, among others, and relies on donations to cover a large part of the &#163;7 million a year that it needs to keep going.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/8">It is unfortunate that those charities have to rely on fundraising to undertake work that provides a lifeline to those suffering after service. Veterans are clearly not a priority for this Government; they were not for the previous Government either. They are a priority for the charities, but it is a sad fact that in our society it is charities that are caring for our war wounded. More funding should be directed to the psychological welfare of ex-service personnel, and it should come from the public purse.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/9">The funding issue will only get worse. The Government are planning to double the number of reservists, from 15,000 to 30,000, by 2018. That raises a key question, because reserve personnel are more likely than regular soldiers to suffer from PTSD. Therefore, we need a strategy for the future to tackle that invisible consequence of service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/10">Funding has been allocated for those brave personnel, but we do not know whether any of it will cover increased mental health provision. I have a few precise questions about the Government&#8217;s plans to care for those additional members of the armed forces, who take on the responsibility alongside their day jobs. Since reservists are going to be more exposed to the front line, will there be a change to the pre-deployment training to reflect that, and will there be any additional provision for reservists and their families?</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/11">On that point, let me underline the importance of including families in any post-deployment care. PTSD and other mental health problems do not have individual victims; their effects permeate the lives of sufferers&#8217; friends and family, and often that effect is overlooked. It is perhaps more pertinent for reservists, as they return to environments where their experience is not particularly well understood. They can find it hard to readjust to civilian life, and their friends and family find it hard to see the person they loved change into someone new.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/12">As an MP with a long history of standing up for rights in the workplace, I am also interested to hear how reservists&#8217; rights will be protected. Will the Minister be looking to change post-deployment rest and recuperation, given that it is a key factor, cited by many experts, for why they do not recover? That seems a sensible suggestion to help mitigate the effects of traumatic experiences in</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/13">the field. If that was the case, how much extra time away from work would that imply? Will reservists be given guarantees by the Government that their involvement will not hinder their job applications or relationships with employers?</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/14">Reservists, as with all other armed forces personnel, make a great sacrifice for their country and should not be penalised for that. They face specific issues on return, such as a lack of understanding from friends and family and more open criticism of the war in Iraq. They are also usually called upon to fill gaps in the regulars, becoming out of sync with the rest of their unit and, therefore, lacking the comradeship that can be such an important part of service. As such, they should be given the proper prevention and intervention strategies they need to readjust to civilian life and prevent any mental health issues manifesting themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/15">I am sure that the Minister agrees with me on many of these issues. He might be searching desperately in his limited budget for spare cash to spend on mental health care for veterans. Perhaps I can help him in that regard. We have called for deeper cuts to the number of one-star officers and those above, the highest paid, in order to correct the top-heavy imbalance across our services. I am not usually in favour of redundancy policies, but the number of the most senior officers in the MOD has risen by a third since 1990. We have more admirals than ships. We have a higher number of officers across all three services than do the French and US air, maritime and land forces. Although 20% of more junior ranks look set to lose their jobs, just one in 20 of the most senior officers in all three services have been made redundant. The money spent employing senior officers could be much better spent helping to ease the burden of veterans&#8217; charities. The &#163;1 million could be spent on a fund that would focus research on mental health issues and charities could bid for funds to support their own policy research.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/16">It is estimated that by 2020 1.8 million people in the armed forces community will be living with a long-standing illness. I have spent much of my political career fighting for people who have been injured or made ill as a result of their job. Serving in a combat zone where their life is constantly imperilled places unique burdens on our service personnel. It is imperative that the Government recognise the need to ensure that our armed forces are afforded not only the best physical care but the best mental health care while serving and after returning to civilian life. We cannot rely on charities to do this vital work any longer. I sincerely hope that this debate has managed to bring some of the issues to the table, and I will be interested to hear the Minister&#8217;s plans to ensure the mental well-being of our respected veterans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1108.1/17">Finally, it would be inappropriate in the context of this debate not to mention the Christmas Island veterans, who are still looking for compensation after almost 40 years. I hope that the Minister will say something about them as well.</p>

	<p pid="a.1110.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40473" name="Jim Sheridan">the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Jim Sheridan)</phrase> on securing this debate on the mental health of our former service personnel. I thank him for his courtesy in giving me some idea of the issues that he intended to raise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110.0/2">This is a vital subject in which cross-Government working is having a real impact. Although the four UK Health Departments hold primary responsibility for the issue, I naturally take a very close interest in it given my veterans portfolio. I hope that in the previous debate on armed forces personnel I was able to persuade the House that in the three months in which I have been doing the job I have taken a very close interest particularly in the medical issues that affect personnel and veterans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110.0/3">That said, I must regretfully disagree with the charges that the hon. Gentleman laid against this Government. We are investing in mental health at every juncture of a service career. From recruitment, to deployment, to discharge and transition into civilian life, the Ministry of Defence and the Department of Health have made funding available for extensive support to serving personnel and veterans who encounter mental health problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110.0/4">Let me also say that the Government very much welcome the role played by service charities. It is entirely appropriate that we should look to harness their niche capability and expertise to maximise the quality of support given to the service community. In many cases, this support is provided by a partnership with Government, and that should be celebrated rather than regretted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110.0/5">As the former Defence Secretary, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40445" name="Liam Fox">the Member for North Somerset (Dr Fox)</phrase>, announced on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-06">6 October</phrase> last year, the Government accepted all the recommendations in &#8220;Fighting Fit&#8221;, the report by the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40562" name="Andrew Murrison">the Member for South West Wiltshire (Dr Murrison)</phrase> which now forms the backbone of the work being done across Government to improve mental health care for service personnel and veterans. I can report good progress in delivering those recommendations. The hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North specifically talked about veterans, but I will briefly set out the context of our overall strategy for mental health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1110.0/6">While serving, all personnel, including reservists, are encouraged to report distress or mental health concerns. We have introduced a process called trauma risk management, or TRiM&#8212;a peer group support system that is helping to identify those at risk and provide support to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1111.0/1">From what I have heard, there is extremely good counselling in the field after incidents have occurred. People zone in on those affected, immediately and without delay, and check them out as best they can.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1111.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40491" speakername="Mark Francois" colnum="1111"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0004.htm#12120641000223">
	<p pid="a.1111.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for that important intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/2">TRiM was initially developed by the Royal Marines. It involves training non-specialists in military units to lead discussions about traumatic events and spot those who may need additional help. We make sure that we have mental health professionals forward deployed in theatre, exactly along the lines that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> mentioned, to deal with such eventualities if and when they occur. We deploy uniformed mental health teams to provide care on the front line. Regular psychological health assessments are conducted to ensure that support in theatre is sufficient and, if needed, a UK-based team of a psychiatrist and mental health nurse can deploy to theatre at short notice if an incident warrants it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/3">At the end of an operational tour, units undergo decompression&#8212;an opportunity to unwind and talk about their experiences. At this point, personnel also receive a series of briefings designed to help them adapt to their return from deployment, and mental health is one of the specific issues raised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/4">Specific measures are also in place for those leaving the service. After a successful regional pilot, structured mental health assessments were rolled out nationally in July 2012 as part of routine and discharge medicals. We hope they will be useful in highlighting mental health problems at an early stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/5">To ease transition from military to civilian life, personnel with identified mental health issues can access military departments of community mental health up to six months after discharge. There are 15 such departments across the United Kingdom, providing specialist mental health support to military personnel. In addition, GP registration forms in England, Scotland and Wales now enable those who have served to declare this when registering with a doctor&#8217;s practice, providing an opportunity to discuss their unique needs, if they so wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/6">On the specific steps that we are taking for veterans, the Department of Health, working with South Staffordshire and Shropshire mental health trust, has put in place a national veterans mental health network. This brings together NHS clinicians, the Ministry of Defence, Combat Stress and others to assess the implementation of the recommendations made by the Under-Secretary. The network&#8217;s first full meeting was in Stafford on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-29">29 October</phrase> and a national conference will take place in March 2013. I also take this opportunity to place on the record our appreciation for the valuable work done by Combat Stress, and I am looking forward to a meeting with its chief executive, Mr Andrew Cameron, in the next few days.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/7">Armed forces networks, whose role is to provide links between the forces and the wider community on health issues, are beginning to implement veterans mental health projects in each former strategic health authority area. I am delighted to report that there are now more than 50 extra veterans mental health professionals in the NHS across the various armed forces networks in England, which is 20 more than originally recommended by my hon. Friend. I do not, therefore, accept the point made by the hon. Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North about lack of resources, although I accept that he made it in good faith.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/8">In his report, my hon. Friend acknowledged the value of the medical assessment programme, which offers assessments to ex-service personnel suffering mental health problems. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-29">29 October</phrase>, the MAP was relocated with the reserves mental health programme at Chilwell, Nottingham, to form the veteran and reserves mental health programme. This more central location in the middle of the country will, we believe, make for easier access and ensure that high standards of clinical oversight are maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/9">More than 2,500 members of the armed forces community are now registered to use the Big White Wall, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned. It is a website that allows users to talk anonymously about mental health issues. Early indications suggest that it is proving a valuable means of interaction without the stigma sometimes attached to mental health. User surveys are reporting</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/10">significant reductions in stress and anxiety, not least because individuals can raise issues anonymously, if they so choose.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/11">Plans are also maturing for the veterans information service, a means of providing advice to veterans on accessing services and support for health issues related to their military service. When launched, all veterans who leave the armed forces will be contacted by letter or e-mail after 12 months, so that we can check how they are getting on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/12">On work in the nations and regions, I recently met Keith Brown MSP, the Scottish Minister for Transport and Veterans, to discuss the steps the Scottish Government are taking on veterans&#8217; issues. In addition to maintaining support for specialist mental health services for the next three years, they will fund and seek to expand the Veterans First Point service, an advice centre designed to help veterans and their families during the transition to civilian life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/13">In Wales, the all Wales veterans health and wellbeing service is providing access to specialist outpatient care and signposting veterans and their families to other support that they may require. It offers access to therapists with expertise in veterans&#8217; mental health to provide assessment, treatment and referral. Treatment options include commissioning the services of Combat Stress, which works in partnership with the service to provide nurse-led community support groups.</p>
	<p pid="a.1111.1/14">In Northern Ireland&#8212;I should place on the record that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" name="Jim Shannon">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase> was present for part of this debate&#8212;a specialist aftercare service was established in 2007 to address the unique requirements of veterans of the Ulster Defence Regiment and the Royal Irish Regiment home service, and their dependants. Each year, that widely praised aftercare service deals with about 4,500 cases, providing welfare support and medical services, including mental health support.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1113.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40473" speakername="Jim Sheridan" colnum="1113"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0004.htm#12120641000224">
	<p pid="a.1113.0/1">Is the Minister aware that a significant number of veterans are serving prison sentences or are on parole? The American system is different because it tracks the crimes of ex-service personnel. I am not suggesting for a minute that people should be able to commit crimes and get away with them, but is there something that we could do in Britain to copy the American system?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-12-06a.1113.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40491" speakername="Mark Francois" colnum="1113"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121206/debtext/121206-0004.htm#12120641000225">
	<p pid="a.1113.1/1">I have looked into this matter and am advised that the proportion of veterans in prison is no higher than the proportion of the civilian population that is in prison. We need to do what we can through rehabilitation and other means to help those people, just as we would help others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.1/2">The Department of Health in England has extended its funding of the Combat Stress and Rethink 24-hour mental health helpline for service personnel, families and veterans. In addition, the Department of Health, in partnership with the Royal College of General Practitioners, has put in place training packages for GPs to raise awareness of the unique needs of armed forces families and veterans.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.1/3">On a broader point, in line with the principles of the armed forces covenant&#8212;we launched the report on that today&#8212;the Government have reaffirmed that veterans</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.1/4">in England should be given priority NHS treatment for conditions related to service, subject to the clinical needs of others. The Scottish and Welsh Governments accord the same priority to veterans. That is important, given that one in 10 adults in the United Kingdom is now a veteran, going right back through the second world war, Northern Ireland and other conflicts up to the present day. A high proportion of our population have served their country in uniform in one way or another.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.1/5">The hon. Gentleman referred specifically to post-traumatic stress disorder. I was delighted to be able to visit King&#8217;s college London recently, not least because some time ago that was where I completed my masters degree in war studies. To some extent, I was going back to my alma mater. While there, I met Professor Simon Wessely and his internationally renowned team in the King&#8217;s centre for military health research. Mental health issues, particularly PTSD, have been a key focus of his research, which the MOD continues to fund. I was reassured by Professor Wessely that comparatively low rates of PTSD are being recorded in the service community. The evidence indicates that the mental health of the armed forces remains robust, but naturally we will do our utmost to help the minority who develop PTSD or other mental illnesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.1/6">In addition to the measures that are already in place, we have made provision for the training for primary health care staff to raise awareness of PTSD. Defence Medical Services has more than 200 mental health professionals who provide specialist support to service personnel and, as I have mentioned, additional personnel are available in the NHS to augment the existing capability. I have also mentioned the veterans and reserves mental health programme, which the MOD continues to fund. The Department of Health has agreed to fund the provision of acute PTSD services by Combat Stress with &#163;3.5 million a year for five years. As I have said, I shall be meeting Andrew Cameron shortly to discuss how that money can best be deployed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.1/7">The hon. Gentleman asked about the Christmas Island veterans. I hope that he will forgive me, but I have concentrated my remarks on mental health. The fairest thing that I can say is that I will write to him about that issue. I hope, under the circumstances, that he regards that as acceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.1/8">I think that what I have said gives an indication of the importance the Government attach to the treatment of the mental health problems of our service personnel and veterans. Although we have long been aware of the implications of physical injury to our armed forces personnel, it is fair to say that for a long period there has been a stigma surrounding mental health. We are starting fully to recognise and deal with the impact on the lives of those who suffer from such issues. It is to the credit of the previous Government that work was done to begin to address these issues on their watch. The House can rest assured that the current Government will continue to do all that we practically can to look after service personnel and veterans who develop mental health issues. These people are important to our country and we must do our best for them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.1/9" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1113.1/10" class="italic">House adjourned .</p>
