	<p pid="b.1128.1/1">There are certainly a great many lessons to be learnt from the London Challenge. The hon. Gentleman will be aware of reports which have been published over the last few months and which seek to draw those lessons. One lesson that I would draw is that it is important for us to provide the opportunities that the London Challenge helped to create for every part of the country, and not just for areas that have been selected by Ministers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1128.4/1">I welcome the new Education Secretary to her job. I also welcome back the Schools Minister, who has made the greatest comeback since Lazarus. I am not sure why we need two Schools Ministers, one in the blue corner and one in the yellow corner, but perhaps that is the reason.</p>
	<p pid="b.1128.4/2">One suggestion for the Education Secretary that I have received is that she should change the locks at Sanctuary Buildings to ensure that the former Education Secretary and his adviser Dominic Cummings cannot sneak back in after dark. However, she could help less affluent pupils immediately if she reversed her predecessor&#8217;s political instruction to Ofqual to end the AS-level link, which research shows helps them to obtain good university places. Will she signal a fresh start by reversing that decision?</p>

	<p pid="b.1128.5/1">There are no plans to go down the route that the hon. Gentleman has suggested. We, as a Government, believe passionately that the final years of education for young people should be years in which they focus not just on examinations, but on learning. The problem during the most recent period of Labour government was that, in the last four years of education, too much time was spent taking exams rather than learning new facts.</p>

	<p pid="b.1129.2/1">I pay tribute to John and Louise Ravenscroft of the charity Family Voice for their wonderful work in Peterborough. What assurance can the Minister give that parent carer forums will receive core funding from the Department for 2015-16 and beyond, so that they can continue their work in facilitating parent participation?

	<p pid="b.1129.3/1">We recognise the important role played by parent carer forums. We have therefore increased the funding for each forum from &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000, which amounts to a total of more than &#163;2 million for 2014-15. As my hon. Friend will appreciate, we have not yet made any decisions about funding beyond that time frame, but, in his customary manner, he has made a strong case for support for their continued work by citing the work of his constituents.</p>

	<p pid="b.1129.5/1">The reasons why my hon. Friend is receiving correspondence about the current SEN system are also why, under the Children and Families Act 2014, we are bringing in substantial changes to introduce, from September, a single SEN system that puts families at the centre of decision making right at the start when they require extra support. Over and above that, we are also providing an additional &#163;30 million of new funding so that parents can have independent supporters to assist them in navigating themselves through the system, which, in the past, too many of them have found too difficult.</p>

	<p pid="b.1130.0/1">The hon. Gentleman, as the former Chair of the Select Committee on Education&#8212;which I had the pleasure to serve on during his tenure&#8212;is acutely aware of the importance of early identification in our schools for a whole host of reasons. That is why the new code of practice that underpins the Children and Families Act 2014 makes it clear throughout that early identification must be at the centre of the work that schools do on behalf of their pupils. We are providing additional funding to support those endeavours&#8212;I will be happy to write to the hon. Gentleman with more details&#8212;but many of the decisions will be made at a local level and will be made far more transparent through the publication of a local offer in every council.</p>

	<p pid="b.1130.2/1">The number of children with dyslexia in this country has grown, so it is even more important that we recognise how we can support the many excellent organisations that are out there. That is why we are funding the Dyslexia-Specific Learning Difficulty Trust to the tune of &#163;1.5 million over two years to help provide it with a range of special services so it can increase the support available to children and young people with dyslexia. We are also funding the British Dyslexia Association&#8217;s primary literacy project, which is training over 3,000 teachers who have obtained specialist dyslexia qualifications. Ultimately, however, it is the changes we are introducing in our SEN reforms that will make a difference to families.</p>

Of course every council will have to publish and review them, and to consult local families and young people so that they have an input into ensuring that the services they require are available when they need them. Ofsted also plays a role in trying to understand the impact of the reforms, and I am looking forward to seeing its response.</p>

	<p pid="b.1131.0/1">It is important to remember that the amount of money being made available to schools for SEN children is the same this year as it was last year, and so this is about how we allocate those resources. In addition, those on statements will in future be on education, health and care plans, whereby there are additional duties, not just on schools, but on health providers, where schools sometimes complain that there is less co-operation and less endeavour to ensure that the required support is made available. That extra duty on the health providers is a big step forward, and people have been calling for it for a considerable time.</p>

	<p pid="b.1131.2/1">I completely agree with my hon. Friend that those are key services for many families where there are children with SEN and disabilities. Through the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme, we have made much more money available&#8212;&#163;54 million, I believe&#8212;to provide better services. I also know that work is going on in the Department of Health to look more widely at the role of CAMHS, as we know that provision has been patchy for too long. Although there are good examples in places such as Liverpool, where it is functioning well, it is falling short in too many parts of the country. As I say, there are greater duties on health services to make sure that what is in an EHC plan is provided, but of course we need to ensure that that remains the case right across the board.</p>

He will know that the National Day Nurseries Association published research last year showing that the cost of child care had stabilised and was starting to come down.

This is not just about the affordability of child care; it is also about its availability, and the Government are failing on that, too. Figures from the Family and Childcare Trust show that the amount of holiday child care to help working parents has halved under this Government&#8212;for parents of disabled children the figure is even worse. Will she tell working parents in my constituency what real help this Government are going to give them, particularly as they face the reduction in summer holiday child care availability?</p>

	<p pid="b.1132.2/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that. As a working parent, I sympathise with all working parents about the availability and affordability of child care. This Government take that extremely seriously. I have mentioned tax-free child care, but we have also introduced shared parental leave and we are increasing child care support under universal credit. It should also be noted that the latest figures show that there are about 100,000 more child care places than there were in 2009.</p>

The Government&#8217;s tax-free child care policy will extend to children up to the age of 12&#8212;it will extend up to the age of 17 for disabled children.

May I take it from the fact that she is answering the questions that she is now the child care Minister as well as Secretary of State and that despite her expanding ministerial team she has taken on those responsibilities? I am all for flexi-working, but given the challenge our country faces with its child care system I hope that she can focus full time on this issue. As other Members have said, the Family and Childcare Trust and Netmums have shown that the cost and availability of holiday child care are damaging the economy, with 1 million working days lost because parents cannot find or afford holiday child care to fit their needs. What does the Secretary of State say to parents being forced to take time off this summer, during this Parliament, because they cannot get the summer child care they need?</p>

I look forward to continuing these debates with the hon. Lady, as does the Minister who will be taking on the specific responsibility for child care.

The new technical awards for 14 to 16-year-olds are one example of how young people can learn the practical skills needed for the workplace. Our revised statutory guidance on careers advice, effective from September, will strengthen the requirement for schools to build links with employers to give students an insight into a broad range of careers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1142.4/1">From September 2014, eight regional school commissioners, supported by head teacher boards, will ensure more local oversight of academies and free schools by highly respected local practitioners and leading sector representatives. We have also strengthened the guidance for local authorities on intervening in maintained schools, as well as ensuring that Ofsted inspections use a risk-based approach, with more frequent inspection for those performing least well. The chief inspector has the power to inspect any school at any time where he has concerns.</p>

	<p pid="b.1144.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right to say that educational standards on the Isle of Wight are unacceptably low. That is why, in July 2013, the previous Secretary of State issued a direction notice to Isle of Wight council to improve standards. My hon. Friend will know that Hampshire is now the island&#8217;s strategic partner, and that it is making good progress with the schools on the island.

	Ukraine (Flight MH17) and Gaza
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-21b.1149.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40665" speakername="David Cameron" speakeroffice="The Prime Minister"  colnum="1149"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140721/debtext/140721-0001.htm#140721-0001.htm_spmin17">
	<p pid="b.1149.1/1">This is the first time that the House has met since the tragic loss of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 last Thursday, and I think that it is right to make a statement about that and the ongoing crisis in Israel and Gaza.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/2">Flight MH17 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down by a surface-to-air missile over eastern Ukraine. All 298 people on board were killed. That includes 10 of our own citizens, as many as 80 children, and victims from nine other countries, including 193 Dutch citizens. It also includes members of an Australian family who lost relatives on Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 earlier this year. From Adelaide to Amsterdam, from Kuala Lumpur to Newcastle, we are seeing heart-wrenching scenes of grief as communities come together to remember their loved ones. I am sure that the whole House will join me in sending our deepest condolences to the friends and families of everyone affected. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;]</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/3">Alongside sympathy for the victims, there is anger. There is anger that this could happen at all; there is anger that the murder of innocent men, women and children has been compounded by sickening reports of looting of victims&#8217; possessions and interference with the evidence; and there is rightly anger that a conflict that could have been curtailed by Moscow has instead been fomented by Moscow. That has to change now.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/4">In the past few days, I have spoken to Presidents Obama and Hollande, Chancellor Merkel, and the Prime Ministers of the Netherlands, Malaysia, Poland and Australia. We are all agreed on what must happen. First, those with influence on the separatists must ensure that they allow the bodies of the victims to be repatriated and provide uninhibited access to the crash site to enable a proper international investigation of what happened to flight MH17. Secondly, President Putin must use his influence to end the conflict in Ukraine by halting supplies and training for the separatists. Thirdly, we must establish proper long-term relationships between Ukraine and Russia; between Ukraine and the European Union; and, above all, between Russia and the European Union, NATO and the wider west. Let me take each of those points in turn.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/5">The first priority remains ensuring that there is proper access to the crash site to repatriate the bodies and investigate what happened. The UK has sent air accident investigators and a police-led victim identification team to help the international effort. The Ukrainian Ministry of Emergency Situations has searched an area of 32 sq km around the crash site and recovered 272 bodies. The work has been made more difficult by the presence of armed separatists. The bodies sitting on a refrigerated train have still not been allowed to leave. The pictures of victims&#8217; personal belongings being gone through are a further sickening violation of the tragic scene. It is welcome that international experts have been able to visit the site, but this should not have taken four days, and even now they are still not getting the unimpeded access that they need.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/6">I spoke to President Putin last night and made it clear that there can be no more bluster or obfuscation. We expect him to help right now by using his influence with</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/7">the pro-Russian separatists to secure full access for international investigators, and to support the repatriation of the bodies by handing them over to the appropriate authorities and ensuring that they are treated with dignity. Families want information and answers, and we must make sure that they get them. The UK and Australia have tabled a joint resolution at the United Nations Security Council demanding proper access in support of a credible international investigation, and we expect that resolution to be voted on this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/8">Secondly, I also made it clear to President Putin that we expect Russia to end its support for the separatists and their attempts to further destabilise Ukraine. No one is saying that President Putin intended flight MH17 to be shot down&#8212;it is unlikely that even the separatists wanted this to happen&#8212;but we should be absolutely clear about what caused this terrible tragedy to happen. The context for this tragedy is Russia&#8217;s attempt to destabilise a sovereign state, violate its territorial integrity, and arm and train thuggish militias.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/9">Over the past month there has been an increasing amount of heavy weaponry crossing the border from Russia to separatist fighters in Ukraine, and there is evidence that Russia has been providing training to separatist fighters at a facility in south-west Russia, including training on air defence systems. Seconds before flight MH17 dropped out of contact, a surface-to-air missile launch was detected from a separatist-controlled area in south-eastern Ukraine. According to expert analysis, an SA-11 is the most likely missile type. In an intercepted conversation, a known separatist leader was overheard claiming that a separatist faction had downed an aircraft. Another separatist leader claimed on Twitter at about the same time to have shot down an aircraft, while a video on social media over the weekend showed an SA-11 missile system, missing at least one missile, travelling back towards Russia. Those who argue that the Ukrainians could be responsible need to explain all of this. In addition, there is no evidence that Ukrainian forces have fired a single surface-to-air missile during the conflict, and no Ukrainian air defence systems appear to have been within range of the crash. By contrast, pro-Russian separatist fighters have downed more than a dozen Ukrainian aircraft over the past few months, including two transport aircraft, so the picture is becoming clearer and the weight of evidence is pointing in one direction: MH17 was shot down by an SA-11 missile fired by separatists.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/10">Thirdly, this is a defining moment for Russia. The world is watching, and President Putin faces a clear choice in how he decides to respond to this appalling tragedy. I hope that he will use this moment to find a path out of this festering and dangerous crisis by ending Russia&#8217;s support for the separatists, but if he does not change his approach to Ukraine in that way, Europe and the West must fundamentally change our approach to Russia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/11">Those of us in Europe should not need to be reminded of the consequences of turning a blind eye when big countries bully smaller countries. We should not shrink from standing up for the principles that govern conduct between independent nations in Europe, and that ultimately keep the peace on our continent. For too long there has been a reluctance on the part of too many European countries to face up to the implications of what is happening in eastern Ukraine. It is time to make our power, influence and resources felt.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/12">Over the weekend I agreed with Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande that we should push our partners in the European Union to consider a new range of hard-hitting economic sanctions against Russia. We should take the first step at the Foreign Ministers meeting in Brussels tomorrow, and if Russia does not change course, then we must be clear that Europe must keep increasing the pressure. Russia cannot expect to continue enjoying access to European markets, European capital and European knowledge and technical expertise while she fuels conflict in one of Europe&#8217;s neighbours. We must do what is necessary to stand up to Russia and put an end to the conflict in Ukraine before any more innocent lives are lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/13">Let me now turn to the ongoing crisis in Israel and Gaza. The crisis was triggered by Hamas raining hundreds of rockets on Israeli cities, indiscriminately targeting civilians in contravention of all humanitarian law and norms. In the last fortnight, Hamas has fired 1,850 rockets at Israeli cities. This unprecedented barrage continues to this moment, with Hamas rejecting all proposals for a ceasefire, including those put forward by the Egyptian Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/14">I have been clear throughout this crisis that Israel has the right to defend itself. Those criticising Israel&#8217;s response must ask themselves how they would expect their own Government to react if hundreds of rockets were raining down on British cities today. But I share the grave concern of many in the international community about the heavy toll of civilian casualties. The figures are very disturbing. More than 500 people have now reportedly been killed in Gaza, and over 3,000 injured. The UN estimates that over 83,000 people have been displaced so far. Israel has also faced loss of life, with 18 soldiers and two civilians killed, including 13 soldiers yesterday alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/15">I spoke to Prime Minister Netanyahu again about this crisis last night. I repeated our recognition of Israel&#8217;s right to take proportionate action to defend itself, and our condemnation of Hamas&#8217;s refusal to end its rocket attacks, despite all international efforts to broker a ceasefire. But I urged him do everything to avoid civilian casualties, to exercise restraint, and to help find ways to bring this situation to an end. Prime Minister Netanyahu made it clear that Israel had been ready to accept each of these ceasefire proposals and had unilaterally implemented a temporary ceasefire in the hope that Hamas would follow suit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1149.1/16">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has spoken to President Abbas to welcome his support for a ceasefire and underline our wish to see the Palestinian Authority back in Gaza. The United Nations Security Council met in a special session last night and issued a call for an immediate ceasefire. The Council expressed serious concern about rising casualties, and called for respect for international humanitarian law and the protection of civilians. We strongly endorse that call. It is vital that Hamas recognises the need to enter into serious negotiations to end this crisis. In particular, we urge Hamas to engage with the ceasefire proposals put forward by the Egyptian Government. It is only by securing a ceasefire that the space can be created to address the underlying issues and return to the long and painstaking task of building the lasting and secure peace that we all want to see, and I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1152.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement and advance sight of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.0/2">The shooting down of MH17 over the skies of Ukraine was a tragedy that shocked the world. On behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, who is visiting Washington, I join the Prime Minister in expressing our heartfelt and deepest sympathy to the relatives of those who have lost their lives. All of us have been outraged by the images of the site left open for anyone to trample over, and the way that the bodies of the deceased have been handled with what looks like casual indifference. We have all been horrified, but what must it be like for the families of the deceased to see that?</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.0/3">Those families face not only grief and loss, but multiple practical issues. Will the Prime Minister identify a senior Minister to co-ordinate support for them? That role was performed by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40212" name="Tessa Jowell">the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood (Dame Tessa Jowell)</phrase> after 9/11, 7/7 and the tsunami. Will he ensure that his Government do everything they can to enable the international community to help secure the site, repatriate the bodies, and gather the evidence that shows who is responsible? Does he agree that as soon as the investigation of the disaster is complete, there should be an emergency meeting of European Heads of Government to consider what further steps should be taken? It appears that international civil aviation regulators imposed no restrictions on crossing that part of eastern Ukraine. In the light of the attack on flight MH17, is there now specific travel advice for British citizens planning to go abroad?</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.0/4">As the Prime Minister set out in his statement, evidence is growing that this was not simply a tragedy but a terrible crime. Surely this is a moment of reckoning for Europe. This is the moment for a strong and determined EU to step up to its responsibilities and confront the Russian actions. Europe must show its sorrow, but it must also show its strength. I welcome the Prime Minister&#8217;s commitment to seek a toughening of EU sanctions against Russia at tomorrow&#8217;s EU Council meeting. Will he tell the House what measures he wants to be considered? Will he support decisive steps to extend sanctions not just against specific individuals but against Russian commercial organisations, to dissuade President Putin from the supply of arms and the support for separatists that he is now providing across the Russian border?</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.0/5">Turning to the horror that is unfolding in Gaza, it is intolerable to see the harrowing images of hospitals overwhelmed, mortuaries overflowing and parents devastated as they cradle their dying children. Yesterday the world stood witness to the most bloodstained day. Since the start of this conflict, 20 Israelis have been killed, 18 of whom were soldiers. More than 500 Palestinians have been killed, including countless children&#8212;innocent young children whose short lives have been ended in the most brutal and horrific of circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.0/6">We cannot reduce this conflict to a ledger of casualties, but we must acknowledge the scale of suffering in Gaza, because the life of a Palestinian child is worth every bit as much as that of an Israeli child. Every death of a Palestinian child will fuel the hatred, embolden Israel&#8217;s enemies and recruit more supporters to terrorist groups such as Hamas. We stand up for Israel&#8217;s right to defend itself, but this escalation will not bring Israel lasting security.</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.0/7">Does the Prime Minister agree with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that we must continue to press for an immediate ceasefire, an immediate end to the Israeli military operation in Gaza, and an end to the rocket fire by Hamas; that all sides must respect international humanitarian law; and that Israel must exercise maximum restraint?</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.0/8">What is the Prime Minister&#8217;s view of the report suggesting that Israel is using flechette shells? Does he agree that the only way to avoid the cycle of violence and perpetual insecurity in the region is to address the root causes of the conflict and that there must be an immediate return to the negotiating table and talks on a two-state solution? As Ban Ki-moon said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1152.0/9">&#8220;Israelis, but also Palestinians, need to feel a sense of security. Palestinians, but also Israelis, need to see a horizon of hope.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.1153.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40140" name="Harriet Harman">the right hon. and learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase> for her response and also for her condolences for those who have lost loved ones. She is absolutely right to say that what has happened over the skies of Ukraine is a deeply human tragedy; that is how we should see it first and foremost. Our thoughts should be with the victims and their families and on the need to get those bodies off the site and to have that site properly dealt with. That is our first priority. She asked a number of specific questions and made some specific points. On the consular work that is being done, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40103" name="Mark Simmonds">the Member for Boston and Skegness (Mark Simmonds)</phrase>, is leading on that. In time, I will want to discuss directly with the victims&#8217; families how best we can take care of all their needs and concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153.0/2">The right hon. and learned Lady asked whether there should be an EU Heads of State/Heads of Government European Council emergency meeting. I certainly do not rule it out, but, in the first instance, we should task our Foreign Ministers, who are meeting on Tuesday night, to set out the tough measures that are necessary to show that Europe is heading on a different path. Then she asked about the travel advice to UK citizens. Of course, Eurocontrol is the organisation that sets the parameters for where aeroplanes can and cannot fly, whereas we give advice about individual countries to which people should and should not travel, and that information is regularly updated on the Foreign Office website.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153.0/3">The right hon. and learned Lady is absolutely right to say that this is a moment of reckoning for Europe, and I very much hope that the European Council will not be found wanting. She asked specifically about the steps that should be taken. As she knows, we have the tier 2 sanctions, some of which have already been put in place, but there is more that can be done, such as naming individuals and increasing the number of asset freezes and travel bans. I suggested at the European Council last week that that number should be broadened to include the cronies and oligarchs around President Putin and other leaders, even if there is not a direct link between them and Crimea and Ukraine. I made some progress on that on Wednesday night, and I hope to make some more progress. It is time to start to go into the tier 3 sanctions. For instance, future military sales from any country in Europe should not be going ahead. We have already stopped them from Britain. A number</p>
	<p pid="b.1153.0/4">of other suggestions were made about airlines and banks, particularly those connected with Crimea, which have not yet been acted on, so there is a whole set of things that needs to be put in train with a very clear message.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153.0/5">On Gaza, the right hon. and learned Lady is absolutely right that we cannot look at the situation in terms of a ledger of casualties. Again, this is a deeply human tragedy. Anyone seeing those pictures in Gaza of the children running across the beach before their young lives are snuffed out&#8212;as a father of three, I cannot help but be incredibly moved by that. What is happening in Gaza is absolutely heartbreaking. We have to be clear, though, about how this could most quickly be brought to an end: that is for Hamas to stop the rocket attacks on Israel. If they stop those, all the other things that we need&#8212;the end of the Israeli operation, and the ceasefire&#8212;would be in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1153.0/6">Again, I agree with the right hon. and learned Lady on the root causes of this. We need to make progress with the two-state solution. That is not going to happen while we do not have a ceasefire and while Hamas is subjecting Israel to rocket attacks. That is the root cause of this, and that is the thing that needs to change and change quickly in order to bring peace to the middle east.</p>

	<p pid="b.1154.0/1">Will the Prime Minister acknowledge that since visa controls and asset freezes have been introduced, President Putin has illegally annexed Crimea and sent in his special forces and so-called volunteers to fight with the insurgents to try to further dismember Ukraine? He has now been responsible for the missile launcher that brought down the international civil airliner. Is it not time to acknowledge that asset freezes and visa controls are useless as a way of influencing his policy, and that the only measures that will influence him are those that go for his Achilles heel?

	<p pid="b.1154.1/1">I think my right hon. and learned Friend, who speaks with great experience, is right. The point I would make is that there have been occasions when the relatively modest measures taken so far have had an effect on the Russian stock market, the Russian currency, Russian investment and Russian growth. Those issues have had an effect, but it is quite clear that we need to do more and we need to it rapidly.</p>

	<p pid="b.1154.2/1">Surely friends of Israel, like the Prime Minister and I, have a duty at this time to speak the truth? These attacks, despite the horrendous rocket assaults on Israel and the extremism of Hamas, are not &#8220;disproportionate&#8221;; in any other conflict they would be described as war crimes. That is the truth. The problem also is that there is no end in sight to this. What will happen, a moderate Palestinian leadership having been replaced by Hamas through the failure to succeed in negotiations, is that Hamas, as the respected former Israeli Government adviser Daniel Levy has suggested, could soon be replaced by ISIS in Gaza. We have to start, as the west, speaking the truth, acting and persuading the Israeli Government to negotiate seriously.</p>

But I think another element of the truth is that if Hamas stopped the rocket attacks on Israel, the Israeli operation in Gaza would end and there would be a ceasefire. The point that the Israeli Prime Minister makes, which I think is a legitimate one, is that there have been a number of occasions when he has unilaterally declared or agreed to a ceasefire, but Hamas will not follow suit. I absolutely agree that we need to speak the truth, but the truth must start with an end to these attacks.</p>

	<p pid="b.1155.2/1">My right hon. and learned Friend makes two extremely good points. First, we have to make sure that when tier 3 sanctions come&#8212;and they should come&#8212;they cover areas such as financial services, defence and energy. That will affect different countries in different ways, but we need to ensure that we are all effectively sharing in the burden. Britain has been clear that we are willing to do that. The second point he makes is that those who argue that the effect of sanctions will be to damage our own economies are missing the bigger point, which is that our economic future is bound up with our economic security. We will lose that diplomatic and economic security if we do not confront the fact that one country in Europe is now being destabilised by Russia, and if we let this happen, others will follow.</p>

It is a toxic mixture that has led to this tragedy, and if we do not do something it could happen again.</p>

That is what needs to happen, so that Russia knows what the result of these types of actions will be.

Yes, of course there will sometimes be some collateral damage to people who suffer because of sanctions, but in this case the only way to bring home to the Russians that their approach is damaging for them is for them to see that the Russian economy will suffer as a result.</p>

During debates on these matters in the European Union, it is often the countries that have the most to lose from economic sanctions that are the strongest supporters of them. The leaders of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland and Romania speak very passionately about the issue, even though their countries will suffer, because they are aware of the consequences of not standing up to a bully. In our EU debates, it tends to be Britain that backs those countries in favour of tough action, and I hope that we shall be able to make more progress in the future than we have made up to now.</p>

When we look at the challenge with Ukraine, we see that nobody is talking about deploying military assets into Ukraine; what we are talking about is using Europe&#8217;s combined financial resources and power to inflict on Russia an approach that means it has to change its course.

I think the only thing that will influence Russia&#8217;s strategic thinking about Ukraine is a sense that the rest of the world is actually going to team up and put in place sanctions that will damage Russia&#8217;s economy. As I said, in the end Russia needs Europe and America more than America and Europe need Russia, and we need to make the balance in that relationship show in order to change Russia&#8217;s thinking. It is not acceptable to destabilise Ukraine and instead the Russians should be seeking a civilised relationship with Ukraine.

I still believe that if the challenge came along where we were asked to serve alongside others to protect our national interests, this House and the country would answer the call. But in this case we are not talking about military intervention; we are talking about, with our partners and with like-minded countries, using our economic and financial muscle in the world to demonstrate what I have said, which is that Russia needs European markets far more than we need Russian markets, and we need to make that strength show.

Friend that it is what we have available&#8212;what is deployable&#8212;that counts, but I disagree with the suggestion that we do not have the sort of capability we need. When it came to providing additional air policing for the Baltic states, who was able to step up to the plate? It was Britain, because we have the relevant fighter aircraft and other aircraft. When it came to the conflict in Libya, who had the right capabilities for deploying the Typhoon, air-to-air refuelling and the other surveillance aircraft? I am not saying that everything is perfect, but by getting rid of mainland European battle tanks and bases in Germany and replacing them with deployable assets that can be used in modern conflict, I think that we have made some progress.</p>

Many of them are on the refrigerated train, and negotiations and discussions are underway right now about trying to get that to leave to go to a Ukrainian city. I will try to keep the House and the country updated.</p>

This has been a massive setback for it, not least because it was preceded by talks of Palestinian unity between Fatah and Hamas. Hamas launching these rocket attacks has not helped either that cause or the cause of a two-state solution.</p>

	<p pid="b.1174.2/1">The reason that there are two statements put together is that one of the hon.

I said in my statement that it looked increasingly likely that an SA-11 had been fired by a separatist, because of where the missile came from and because of the information and intelligence that have been shared. In terms of who trained the person, who was responsible and who knew&#8212;that is information that I am sure the Russians could make available, and I would argue that it is their responsibility to do so.</p>

We are not being particularly precious about who exactly leads the investigation. We are happy for it to be done by international experts with the backing of ICAO&#8212;the International Civil Aviation Organisation&#8212;which is an international body, so there is no excuse for a Russian veto.

	<p pid="b.1176.5/1">The Prime Minister rightly says that big countries should not bully smaller countries, and he rightly expresses concern about the 500 Palestinian dead and 3,000 injured. However, he stops short of accepting what I believe is the opinion of the majority of people in this place and in the country, which is that the Israeli response is not proportionate. What more can he do to express to Israel that that is the view in the UK?</p>

	<p pid="b.1176.6/1">I am sure that the Israelis will be watching the debates in this House and international opinion carefully. One point that I made to Prime Minister Netanyahu was that international opinion supports Israel&#8217;s right to defend itself, but that it is in danger of losing the support of international opinion if anything happens that shows a lack of restraint and a lack of</p>
	<p pid="b.1176.6/2">care about civilian casualties. At the same time, the message should go out from this House that there have been ceasefires called by the Israelis and not matched by Hamas. We must not wish that away or ignore it, because it is a crucial point.</p>

That is why the people who should be securing the crash site and making it available for investigation should be the Ukrainian Government&#8212;it is their country. To bring in UN forces in some way would be to accept that there is a legitimate case to be made for the separatists who are trying to break up the country through violence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1177.2/1">The Prime Minister is right to condemn utterly the downing of MH17 and the way in which the bodies have been dealt with. Does he understand why those who recall that the west supplied and encouraged the protesters of Maidan and held out to them the probably false prospect of the EU welcoming them into its bosom, and who saw the support that the west provided for the overthrow of Ukraine&#8217;s former President as a clear provocation of Russia, find it ironic that the Prime Minister now accuses Russia of being the party that initiated and fomented the tragic division in Ukraine?</p>

I believe that if a sovereign country in Europe wants to sign an association agreement with the EU, it should be free to do so and Russia should respect it. I have always said that Ukraine does not have to choose between a European future and a Russian future; it should seek to be a bridge between the two. Europe is prepared to let that happen, but apparently Vladimir Putin is not.</p>

I cannot exactly tell him that I feel the enormity of what has happened has got through to the Russians yet, not least because of the way their media operate, but the repeated calls by Prime Minister Abbott, Prime Minister Rutte, Chancellor Merkel, Fran&#231;ois Hollande, Barack Obama and myself must be giving some impression that the whole world is coming together in saying that what is happening in eastern Ukraine is absolutely unacceptable.</p>

	<p pid="b.1178.4/1">The Prime Minister will be aware that nothing happens in isolation. One of the reasons for what is happening is that in Gaza, in the past 60 years more than 6 million Palestinians have been forced out of their homes, forced to live in squalor while moving from one country to another, unlawfully imprisoned and treated really badly. All those people have legal documents to prove their ownership of their homes, yet we have done nothing. I am sure that if all those people were given back the homes to which they are legally entitled, the ceasefire would occur immediately.</p>

	<p pid="b.1178.5/1">I do not accept that we have done nothing. Britain is one of the largest donors to the Palestinian Authority, and we repeatedly meet and work with the Palestinian leadership. We have been staunch in our view that the settlement activity is illegal, and we have done a huge amount to try to bring about a two-state solution. But in the end, we cannot want it to happen more than the parties themselves want it to happen. They need to negotiate.</p>

On Ukraine, is the Prime Minister satisfied that western banks applied the proper criteria when money was being hollowed out of the finances within Ukraine and smuggled out of that country and into bank accounts in the west?

Seeking to understand a conflict is very different from justifying it, yet so often in the Israel-Palestine debate it suits some to conflate the two, which is both lazy and unhelpful.

	<p pid="b.1187.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read a Second time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1187.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">The Bill is about bringing back common sense to a part of our society that week in, week out frustrates many of us; about restoring balance to the health and safety culture that all too often goes beyond what is necessary to protect individuals; about tackling a culture of ambulance chasing that all too often is about generating opportunities to earn fees, rather than doing the right thing; about ensuring that people who do the right thing are confident that the law is on their side when they do so; about trying to protect those who act in the interests of our society; about protecting those who go out of their way to take the responsible approach; and about protecting those who take risks to try to help those who are in trouble. It does not rewrite the law in detail or take away discretion from the courts, but it sends a signal to our judges and a signal to those thinking about trying it on&#8212;by bringing a case in the hope that it will not be defended&#8212;that the law is no longer on their side.</p>
	<p pid="b.1187.2/3">We live in a society that is increasingly litigious. In a country where things are safer than ever, where our workplaces are less risky than ever and where safety standards on our roads are higher than ever, that should not be happening. Of course accidents happen; they always will. Of course people do dumb things; they always will. Of course unscrupulous people will cut corners and put others in danger; they always will. But there is no need for us to be suing more and more. In the last three years alone, figures for personal injury claims registered with the compensation recovery unit show that claims against employers have increased from around 81,000 in 2010-11 to more than 105,000 in 2013-14&#8212;an increase of 30%.</p>

	<p pid="b.1187.3/1">I very much support what the Minister is doing, because there are some people out there who genuinely need to sue when there is a problem, but there are many who have manufactured a situation, where they were probably at fault themselves, and then want to blame somebody else. There is a culture of blaming somebody else whatever happens. We need to take responsibility for our own actions as well as everyone else&#8217;s.</p>

	<p pid="b.1188.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for being pleased to see me still in my place. If he looks at the three elements in the Bill&#8217;s title&#8212;social action, responsibility and heroism&#8212;he will see that all are of great importance. However, when it comes to the responsibility piece in particular, which I am talking about now, those who try to do the right thing and take responsible decisions can still sometimes end up on the wrong end of the law. That is where I want to avoid being. I want those who do the right thing&#8212;in terms of responsibility, that means employers who go out of their way to have the right standards in their workplace&#8212;to feel protected against claims that can sometimes, frankly, be spurious.</p>

They are totally preposterous&#8212;we have seen them, we hate them, and we can all agree on that.

	<p pid="b.1188.2/1">I can absolutely give the hon. Gentleman that assurance, because this Bill is not about taking discretion from the courts. It is about deterring spurious claims and sending a message to the courts that we want them to focus on ensuring that they are on the side of the person who has done the right thing. Of course, where the wrong thing has been done, the force of the law is there to provide an appropriate remedy. However, all too often cases are brought that I think frankly should not be brought. If the hon. Gentleman talks to small businesses in his constituency, I am sure he will find many examples of firms that say, &#8220;Actually, when I get a case against me, it&#8217;s just too much of a hassle to defend it.&#8221;</p>

Come and launch a case.&#8221; He needs to recognise&#8212;I am sure he has constituents in this position as well&#8212;that there are very many responsible employers who fear cases being brought against them when they have done nothing wrong. There are people who volunteer in their communities and who are worried about the legal position in which</p>
	<p pid="b.1188.4/2">that puts them. There are people who, whenever they are faced with a spur-of-the-moment decision on whether to intervene in a crisis, are pursued by the fear that makes them ask themselves &#8220;If I do this, will I be doing the right thing?&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.1189.0/1">As my right hon. Friend may know, yesterday parts of my constituency experienced severe flash flooding from surface water, which affected pretty much the whole of Canvey Island. On numerous occasions, many public-spirited individuals stepped in. I am thinking of people such as Neal Warren and Simon Hart who spent all afternoon unblocking sewers and road drains in Hadleigh, at their own risk, and the neighbours of Bill Monk, a 103-year-old whose carers could not reach him because of the floods. Would the Bill make people in such circumstances more confident that they are safe and will be protected?</p>

I saw the television pictures of what happened in her constituency, and I am sure that we all send our good wishes to the residents of Canvey Island who have experienced such a sudden and unexpected turn of events. Considerable damage and great disruption were caused to the island, and I pay tribute to everyone who has been involved in trying to sort things out. Of course, such people should always feel confident that if they do the right thing by, for instance, trying to unblock a sewer, yet something goes wrong, it is not their fault but a result of their trying to do the right thing for the community. The balance of probability should be that the law is on their side, and that is what the Bill will achieve.</p>

	<p pid="b.1189.3/1">The key thing that the Bill does, in legal terms, is lay down a set of principles for the courts. As my hon. and learned Friend knows, there have been a number of examples over the years in which Parliament has set out principles and allowed the jurisprudence to evolve from them. However, this is not just about what happens in the courts; it is also about what happens outside the courts. It is about the decisions to sue that may or may not be made. It is about the small business that gives way to a spurious claim, believing that there is a risk in defending it. The Bill is designed to send a powerful message, inside but particularly outside the courts, that if someone is going to take legal action, there is clear visibility of the law, and the law will clearly not be on the side of a person who is trying it on. That is what we are trying to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.1189.3/2">Many of the claims that are represented by the 30% increase are doubtless valid, but at least part of that rise must be attributed to an increasingly litigious climate,</p>
	<p pid="b.1189.3/3">spurred on, as I have said, by personal injury firms that are quick to cash in by advertising their services on television and radio, through unsolicited and often deeply irritating and upsetting telephone calls, through posters on buses, and through other marketing techniques. We have focused firmly on ensuring that in future it will be much more difficult for spurious, speculative and opportunistic claims to succeed.</p>

	<p pid="b.1190.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that one way of deciding, in future years, whether the Bill has been a success will be to measure the number of unsuccessful claims for negligence that are being brought before the courts?</p>

	<p pid="b.1190.1/1">That is clearly one of the measures that could be used, but this is an area in which it is very difficult to collect statistics. All too often, these are cases that are conceded a long time before they come to the courts. A small business may be involved. Perhaps there has been an accident at work and it is not the employer&#8217;s fault, but the employee, backed by a firm that is operating on a &#8220; no win, no fee&#8221; basis, pursues the case anyway. All too often, the employer simply gives way. I think that every one of us, in our constituencies, could find a firm that had found itself facing a claim and had felt uncertain about the law: legal aid is expensive, the firm did not feel that the law was on its side, and it therefore did not defend the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.1190.2/1">The Secretary of State is being very generous in giving way. As I have said, I have great respect for him, but when I read about &#8220;social action, responsibility and heroism&#8221; in the Queen&#8217;s Speech, I thought that that meant qualities such as citizenship. I am involved in a campaign about citizenship, and about making educating young people&#8212;and older people&#8212;in good citizenship more of a reality. Listening to the right hon.

	<p pid="b.1190.3/1">The hon. Gentleman will have to let me finish my speech and decide in the round, but I can assure him that small businesses share the concerns I have been setting out. They believe the law needs to be more clearly on their side, but I will come back to the heroism piece and the social responsibility piece because these are important parts of the Bill as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190.3/2">We have focused on trying to ensure that we clamp down on the no win, no fee environment. In 2010 Lord Young published the &#8220;Common Sense, Common Safety&#8221; report, drawing attention to the fact that businesses were operating their health and safety policies in a climate of fear, and that the no win, no fee system introduced by the Labour party had given rise to the perception that there was no risk in starting litigation and it encouraged speculative claims. A whole industry had grown up around that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1190.3/3">Since that report was published, we have introduced a wide range of measures to tackle these damaging effects. We have transformed no win, no fee deals, so lawyers can no longer double their fees if they win at the expense of defendants or their insurers. We have banned referral fees paid between lawyers, insurance claims firms and others for profitable claims. We have reduced by more than half the fees lawyers can charge insurers</p>
	<p pid="b.1190.3/4">for processing low-level personal injury claims. We have banned claims management companies from offering cash incentives or gifts to people who bring them claims. We have changed the law to enable companies that breach claims management regulation unit rules to be fined. We have also helped remove the fear of being sued for breaches of strict liability health and safety duties by introducing changes last year through the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 to prevent claims for damages from being brought under health and safety regulations. In addition to these measures, we are currently taking action through amendments to the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill to extend the ban on offering inducements to include things such as iPads. I do not think they should be offered as a reward by those who drum up business in order to pursue personal injury claims. Together with other provisions in the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill requiring the courts to dismiss fundamentally dishonest claims, this will root out the insidious and damaging bad practice and unacceptable behaviour on the part of some claimants and their lawyers that has tainted personal injury claims in recent years.</p>

	<p pid="b.1191.0/1">I am probably being very obtuse, but everything my right hon. Friend has said over the last two or three minutes is undoubtedly true, yet what I do not understand is how clauses 1, 2, 3 and 4 change what is already in place.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-21b.1191.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40250" speakername="Chris Grayling" colnum="1191"  time="017:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140721/debtext/140721-0002.htm#140721-0002.htm_spnew84">
	<p pid="b.1191.1/1">They do two things. They consolidate the law, which exists in fragmented places around past legislation, so it is very clear what the law says, and they provide additional protection, particularly for volunteers, but, above all, they send a signal from Parliament to the courts, in the way that past legislation also has, and set out a series of principles off the back of which the courts will evolve a jurisprudence. They also send a powerful message to those who never get near the courts and who may give in to claims and currently do not feel the law is on their side&#8212;I can assure the House that they do not feel the law is on their side&#8212;that actually they can stand up and defend a claim in the knowledge that Parliament has very clearly said that the balance in the courts should be in their favour. So this is as much about sending a message outside the courts as inside the courts.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.1/2">Although this Bill focuses on three issues, as I have said I do think that clause 3&#8212;the responsibility piece&#8212;has a particular importance in ensuring we provide proper protection for small businesses. I have talked to countless business groups and employers who tell me how the compensation culture is tying their business in knots. Employers might do the right thing and put in place sensible procedures, but then someone does something daft and the employer still finds themselves facing a damages claim. Of course sometimes that claim will have a genuine basis, and of course sometimes it needs to be recompensed in the courts, but if we are to achieve our goal of supporting business and enterprise and ensuring we continue our success in creating new jobs, we have to make sure the law is properly balanced.</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.1/3">I recognise that worries about liability can arise in other circumstances, too, particularly in the voluntary sector, and let me now turn to the other clauses that address those concerns. In a survey carried out by the</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.1/4">NatCen Social Research and the Institute for Volunteering Research, worries about risk and liability was an issue cited by 47% of those questioned who were not currently volunteering. That study was carried out over the course of 2006-07, but the more recent insightful reports by Lord Young and Lord Hodgson concluded that this remains a real issue for would-be volunteers. Indeed, in the Queen&#8217;s Speech debate we heard from a number of hon. Members who reinforced that message from volunteering groups in their constituencies. It has been confirmed by Justin Davis Smith, the executive director of volunteering and development at the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, who said when we announced our plans that there is</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.1/5">&#8220;a great concern about risk&#8230;anything that can be done to break down barriers to people getting involved in their communities is very welcome.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1191.1/6">I say to my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40297" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier)</phrase> that it is precisely for those people that we are sending one of the signposts in this Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.1192.0/1">Obviously, I support the Government&#8217;s objectives and making things easier for volunteers. Have the Government made any study of what effect the Bill would have on the costs on insurance to protect people against strange litigation?</p>

	<p pid="b.1192.1/1">It is difficult to give an exact answer on that. We have not been able to quantify it exactly, but I believe the Bill will contribute to the downward pressure on insurance premiums coming from a range of measures we are putting in place. In itself, it will not necessarily make a massive difference, but together with the other pieces of the jigsaw puzzle we are putting in place on different aspects of insurance costs, ranging from the independent medical panels we are putting in place for motor insurance claims to some of our changes to the regulation of no win, no fee lawyers, it will have&#8212;we are already seeing this in some areas&#8212;a downward effect on insurance claims.</p>

	<p pid="b.1192.2/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that one constraint on getting more volunteers into organisations is the risks they perceive? Does he agree that these concerns and risks are stopping the growth of great organisations such as the Scouts and St John Ambulance, because they cannot get the volunteers? They cannot get young people involved, off the streets and doing positive things.</p>

	<p pid="b.1192.3/1">That is absolutely right. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase> has highlighted the case of a constituent of his who ran an outward bound organisation but has been hamstrung&#8212;he has seen his business almost disappear&#8212;because of pressure as a result of a claim that has been brought. That caused problems to his business when he was seeking only to do the right thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192.3/2">I want people to feel confident about participating in activities that benefit others without worrying about what might happen if, despite their best efforts, something goes wrong and they find themselves defending a negligence claim. Clause 2, on social action, provides valuable reassurance that if that does happen, the court, when reaching a decision on liability, will take careful and</p>
	<p pid="b.1192.3/3">thorough account of the context of the defendant&#8217;s actions and the fact that he or she was acting for the benefit of society.</p>
	<p pid="b.1192.3/4">The final limb of the Bill on heroism addresses another key area of concern. Unfortunately, it is often the case that people are unwilling to intervene to help in emergencies, and may stand by and do nothing when somebody collapses on the street, for example, because they are worried about the legal position if they do try to help and something goes wrong. Although many people do act spontaneously in such situations without giving a second thought to their own interests, we know that many people think it would be safer not to get involved.

Member for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter)</phrase>, in his usual chattering way, asks how I know. Let me refer him back&#8212;he probably was not here&#8212;to the debate following Her Majesty&#8217;s Gracious Speech, which yielded a number of examples of how those worries can manifest themselves. My hon.

	<p pid="b.1193.0/1">May I put the record right, Mr Deputy Speaker? As a Yorkshire Member of Parliament, I know that we have so many volunteers and so much spontaneous public action to step in to the fray when things go wrong. I would hate for that example the Secretary of State gave of someone from Yorkshire to stand, as we are second to none. I have never heard, as a Member of Parliament, of anyone being frightened to wade in and save someone or help someone if it is needed in Yorkshire. I am sorry, but I do not believe there is that much reticence.</p>

	<p pid="b.1193.1/1">All I can say to the hon. Gentleman is that if he were right, this move would not have been as widely welcomed as it has been by the voluntary sector, for precisely the reasons I gave. It has been widely welcomed by that sector, and I am sure that my hon. Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole would be happy to share his experiences with another Yorkshire Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.1193.1/2">Clause 4 therefore addresses these concerns by giving reassurance that heroic behaviour in emergencies will be taken into account by the courts in the event of a negligence claim being brought. The Bill will therefore apply in a wide range of situations in which employers or others have demonstrated a generally responsible approach towards the safety of others during an activity or in which people have been acting for the benefit of society or have selflessly intervened to help others in an emergency.</p>

	<p pid="b.1194.1/1">I am extremely grateful to my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor for giving way. Does he agree that clause 4 would be just as effective without the last 11 words thereof? I urge him to look closely at the clause and see whether the words are necessary.</p>

	<p pid="b.1194.2/1">I can certainly give that assurance to my hon. Friend. I do not think he is right, but we will debate the Bill in Committee and I am sure that he will have the opportunity in Committee and on Report to take a more detailed look at the wording. If there are ways to improve the Bill, we are certainly not closed-minded in that regard, although I believe that the wording is necessary to clarify when clause 4 applies.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194.2/2">What the Bill does not do is tell the court what conclusion it should reach. It does not prevent a person from being found negligent if all the circumstances of the case warrant it. It is important to be clear that it does not prevent medics who negligently injure their patients or others or who perform public services in a negligent way from being held to account. It does not do that. Nor does it have any bearing on deliberate acts of ill-treatment or harm that are inflicted on others and that might amount to criminal offences. In those instances, there could, as now, be repercussions in the criminal courts as well as the civil ones. What it does, as I said at the start of my speech, is drive out spurious claims, deter health and safety jobsworths and help to reassure good, honest and well-meaning citizens that if they act responsibly, do something for the public good or intervene heroically in an emergency, the law will be on their side. Businesses should not be deterred from providing jobs and contributing to our economy by a fear of opportunist litigation and individuals should not be deterred from helping their fellow citizens by a fear that they will somehow put themselves at legal risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.1194.3/1">I support the Bill, because I think it sends a valuable message of reassurance to volunteers and charities. Having knocked around the sector for six years now, I know that there definitely is an issue with people being afraid of being sued.

	<p pid="b.1194.4/1">I will certainly make that very clear. We value enormously the work done by volunteers. May I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my hon. Friend for his very good work with the voluntary sector, which rightly values the contribution he has made?</p>
	<p pid="b.1194.4/2">He has undoubtedly been one of the principal architects of a more favourable environment for charities to operate within.</p>
	<p pid="b.1194.4/3">I believe that the Bill strikes a fair, proportionate and sensible balance that will provide a clear and valuable reassurance to counter the fears that are proving such a deterrent, putting people off volunteering, and that cause anxiety to small businesses, which worry that they might end up at the wrong end of litigation, while ensuring at the same time that those who are genuinely injured through negligence or who suffer wrongs are not prevented from obtaining redress where appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1195.0/1">It is customary, after a reshuffle, to welcome to their places the new Ministers who have been promoted by the Prime Minister. I appreciate that there were a couple of days when the Ministry of Justice was without Ministers and I appreciate that the new ones are part time and unpaid, but I am surprised that they are not here to share the glory of this five-clause Bill. In their absence, I congratulate the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40557" name="Andrew Selous">the hon.

Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning)</phrase> to his new role. It is pleasing that there were finally some willing takers to take up the opportunities in the Ministry of Justice and I wish them luck in their jobs. They will need it over the next 10 months.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195.0/2">So here we are, on the final Monday before the summer recess, in the fifth year of this coalition Government, discussing a five-clause Bill which has been variously described as &#8220;complete gobbledygook&#8221;, &#8220;a turkey&#8221; and my favourite one, &#8220;the gallinaceous love child&#8221; of the Secretary of State and the Minister for Government Policy. Perhaps the most painful of all insults comes from the ConservativeHome blog. The editor of that site put the Bill on the list of those that should not be in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. That is how much the Conservative activists think of the Bill. It is hardly a glowing list of endorsements that herald its arrival.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195.0/3">In his own puff piece for the Bill on ConservativeHome, the Justice Secretary wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.1195.0/4">&#8220;SARAH has taken a while to bring to the fore, and she is now getting ready for her debut in the world.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1195.0/5">Given the rather flat reviews that SARAH&#8217;s debut has so far received, I cannot help but wonder whether she should ever have seen the light of day.</p>

	<p pid="b.1195.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman should give me a chance to complete my speech. Then we can discuss what we are going to do. He has been here for many Parliaments and he will know that we take the opportunity where we can to improve Bills, even five-clause</p>
	<p pid="b.1195.2/2">nonsense Bills, in Committee. I look forward to working with him to improve the Bill during the remaining stages of its passage through the Commons.</p>
	<p pid="b.1195.2/3">I have referred to the fact that the Bill has only five clauses, and I accept that we should not necessarily judge its quality by its length, but if we strip out the first clause, which sets the scene, and the fifth, which deals with extent and commencement, it is only a three-clause Bill. It is so small that the short title is almost longer than the Bill itself. Does the content really warrant a Bill of its own?</p>
	<p pid="b.1195.2/4">It goes without saying that we all support those volunteer. We want to see even more people contributing their time to good causes and to the vibrancy of civil society and communities throughout the country. We do not want to live in a country where there are unnecessary barriers in the way of those who want to donate their time to helping in the local community, nor do we want to live in a society where people feel unable to help out in an emergency because of a fear of litigation. But the premise of the Bill is built on sand. The Justice Secretary has stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1195.2/5">&#8220;All too often people who are doing the right thing in our society feel constrained by the fear that they are the ones who will end up facing a lawsuit&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1195.2/6">and he repeated that in his Second Reading opening speech. One might think that such a sweeping statement would be followed up with some concrete examples where that has happened, or perhaps some statistics to back it up, but no. Instead we are given generally wishy-washy scenarios where people and organisations might&#8212;I stress the word &#8220;might&#8221;&#8212;be put off by fear of litigation.</p>

	<p pid="b.1196.1/1">I am pleased that the Justice Secretary asks that question because the Ministry of Justice has confirmed that the number of civil cases is going down, not up. It would be worth his spending some time looking at his own statistics. He spent a great deal of time during his speech talking about all the progress that he has made in reducing the number of personal injury cases. Either his reforms are not working or the statistics from his Department are wrong. He must decide which it is.</p>
	<p pid="b.1196.1/2">During his 30-minute speech he gave us no hard facts, no proof and no evidence. We know he has previous when it comes to lack of evidence. We have seen the meltdown in probation that has come about because of his Government&#8217;s reckless and half-baked probation privatisation&#8212;all done, again, without any evidence, let alone testing or piloting; nothing to show it would work or would not risk public safety. The Justice Secretary said at the Dispatch Box that he trusted his instinct ahead of hard statistical evidence&#8212;the same instinct that brought us the Work programme and that delivered a prison crisis has now brought us SARAH.</p>
	<p pid="b.1196.1/3">The Justice Secretary tried to give the impression that there was a problem, and he referred to the impact assessment. I can imagine the fear in his officials&#8217; eyes when they were told to go and find some evidence&#8212;any evidence&#8212;to support the aims of his Bill. But the Justice Secretary should have been worried when all</p>

How can he use as evidence a survey done when the 2006 legislation, which many people think deals adequately with the problems that he says he wants to solve, had barely come into force? In fact, there is plenty of evidence out there, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40511" name="Nick Hurd">the hon. Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd)</phrase> said, that contradicts the Government&#8217;s claim. A Cabinet Office report from 2013 shows not a fall but a rise in volunteering, confirmed also this week by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations. Volunteering is going up, not down.</p>

	<p pid="b.1197.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is entirely right, and both sides of the House should celebrate that. It is in part the result of significant Government interventions to remove barriers and reform Criminal Record Bureau checks, and to invest in the opportunities to volunteer, not least the National Citizen Service. This is another milestone on that journey of removing barriers. Yes, volunteering is rising, but still, 20% of volunteers do 80% of the giving. There is so much potential to do more, but far too many people are put off by the risk of being sued, and this Bill aims to create a greater sense of reassurance on that fundamental point.</p>

	<p pid="b.1197.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention because it means that I can refer to the evidence on the barriers to volunteering. The biggest obstacle is a lack of spare time&#8212;60% of respondents said that this applied to them a lot and 23% said it applied little. Where does the Bill give people who want to volunteer more spare time? The second biggest reason given by the survey was bureaucracy. Where does the Bill deal with bureaucracy? Other barriers to people coming forward to volunteer include work commitments; looking after children or the home; looking after someone elderly or ill. The hon. Gentleman will know, if he is really honest, that this is a Bill without a cause. Fear of litigation is a very small factor&#8212;I think only 1% in the most recent survey referred to that.</p>

As I have said, there is no evidence to support the problem that he describes. There is no great health and safety beast suffocating the life out of those doing good deeds, petrified into inaction at the prospect of having to fork out compensation after being sued. Even if there was, the Bill provides no real substantive solutions anyway.</p>

	<p pid="b.1197.4/1">I think that many of us are of the view&#8212;I am a little surprised that this is not in the Bill&#8212;that certain volunteers, particularly</p>
	<p pid="b.1197.4/2">in cave and mountain rescue organisations, and even the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, are put in situations that are probably far too difficult and dangerous. In certain situations, for example when people seem to make a specialism of going on to mountains when they know there will be bad weather, the Government should be doing more to protect those volunteers.</p>

	<p pid="b.1198.0/1">If the Bill was really about social action, responsibility and heroism, those sorts of measures would be in it, but clearly it is not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/2">Let me remind the House of the conclusions of the Government&#8217;s own inquiry, which the Justice Secretary referred to, but not fully. Lord Young of Graffham, in his 2010 report, concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/3">&#8220;The problem of the compensation culture prevalent in society today is, however, one of perception rather than reality.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/4">There we have it, from the Government&#8217;s mouth: it is a perception, not a reality. The report goes on to highlight:</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/5">&#8220;One of the great misconceptions, often perpetuated by the media, is that we can be liable for the consequences of any voluntary acts&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/6">The report then refers to advice given to people in the winter of 2009 about not clearing snow from the front of their houses in case someone slipped and sued them. The Lord Chief Justice said that he had never come across someone being sued in those circumstances, yet the Justice Secretary has wilfully reported that old chestnut in articles he has written before today. I am happy to give way if he would like to intervene and list the occasions since 2010 when such incidents have occurred. No? Well, there we have it. His silence is telling, as he knows there are no such cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/7">If the Justice Secretary&#8217;s point was that the threat of litigation is putting people off clearing snow, the Bill will do nothing to address that. In fact, the MOJ&#8217;s own statistics show that the total number of money claims in civil courts has been following a downward trend in recent years, rather than going up. In any case, the Bill deals with cases that have already reached the courts, so nothing in it will reduce the prospect of being sued. It will not reduce, as he describes it, the &#8220;stress and strain&#8221; if someone is sued.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/8">Instead of preparing this Bill&#8212;the hon. Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner asked this question&#8212;the Secretary of State&#8217;s energies, and those of his officials, would have been better spent rebutting some of the myths about negligence and health and safety. That would have been a better way of tackling the fear of litigation, given that the likelihood of a negligence claim is pretty small. In fact, that was the advice of Lord Dyson, the Master of the Rolls. In a speech entitled &#8220;Compensation culture: Fact or fantasy?&#8221;, he argued that the perception of a compensation culture</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/9">&#8220;is not however as grounded in reality as had been suggested.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/10">He also suggested:</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/11">&#8220;All of this may also require a substantive educative effort on the part of government, the courts and the legal profession to counter-act the media-created perception that we are in the grips of a compensation culture. It may also require greater public legal education.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/12">Perhaps that education should have begun with the Justice Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/13">I have already welcomed the Minister for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims to his new post and congratulated him on his promotion. I am sorry that he</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/14">is not here to share the joys of the Bill with his line manager, because in his previous job at the Department for Work and Pensions he understood exactly the importance of exploding myths about health and safety. In January, in answer to a question from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40371" name="Steve Rotheram">the Member for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram)</phrase> on health and safety, he said that</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/15">&#8216;it is very important that health and safety is taken seriously in the workplace and in public areas. Right across the Christmas period, I went public about the need to ensure that Christmas was not spoiled by stupid comments, and stupid local authorities saying, &#8216;We shouldn&#8217;t do this or that&#8217;&#8212;throw snowballs, or have Christmas trees in certain areas&#8212;&#8216;because of health and safety.&#8217; That is wrong, and it has nothing to do with health and safety; it is an insurance risk.&#8217;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2014-01-13.579"><i>Official Report</i>, 13 January 2014; Vol. 573, c. 579</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/16">I hope that although the Minister is absent today he will be able to import some of his common sense into the current MOJ team. After all, as drafted, this Bill will not help. The Government are seeking to legislate to deal with how we perceive risk, real or otherwise. If he was serious, the Justice Secretary would tackle the misconceptions about the risk of being sued, but that is a trickier task that he has chosen to duck.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/17">In introducing this Bill, the Justice Secretary said a lot about how it will protect the responsible employer. That prompts this question: where are the dozens of examples of courts having had a case before them where an employer has done the right thing and an employee has not, and yet they have found for the employee? There are no examples of such cases. He talked about members of the emergency services not going to someone&#8217;s rescue in case they breach health and safety rules. Will he tell the House what representations he has received from the fire, ambulance, police and coastguard services in support of that contention? Silence again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1198.0/18">I would like to pick up an important legal point. The Bill seems to conflate health and safety and negligence cases. The former are usually strict liability and the latter are not. That confuses civil liability with criminal liability.</p>

	<p pid="b.1199.0/1">I think I know how the right hon. Gentleman will respond to this point, but, for clarity, I am going to put it anyway. There have undoubtedly been cases, have there not, where policemen have said, for example, that they were not prepared to pull an apparently drowned victim out of a pool for fear of not being suitably qualified to do so? Is he saying that some measure other than this Bill will try to prevent that in future? Such cases clearly do exist, as they are widely reported to a horrified public.</p>

	<p pid="b.1199.1/1">I have great respect for the hon. Gentleman, but he was not in the Chamber when I referred to the Master of the Rolls. We need to make sure that employees who do not know the position are educated and told the position, and that those who are not properly trained are properly trained. Debating a three-clause Bill today, and even passing it in the next few months, will not make a jot of difference. We need to make sure that the public and those who work in the emergency services are better educated and know what obligations and duties are placed on them, without the risk and fear of litigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/2">Let us be clear: this Bill is targeted at negligence and not at health and safety at all. When the Justice Secretary claims, as he does, that his Bill will</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/3">&#8220;finally slay much of the &#8216;elf and safety&#8217;&#8230;culture&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/4">he must be honest about the fact that he is being disingenuous, to say the least. If this Bill were really about health and safety, he would be telling the House about the conversations he has had with the Health and Safety Executive and its views on the necessity for such legislation. Again&#8212;I think for the seventh time&#8212;I will happily allow him to intervene on me to update the House on those conversations with the Health and Safety Executive. Silence again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/5">We will use the Committee stage of the Bill to scrutinise in more detail its ramifications, both intended and unintended, because it might end up having the opposite effect to that which the Justice Secretary wants. A single act or omission is all that is needed to be negligent. That act or omission might be so serious, causing injury, pain or even death, as to outweigh any amount of good behaviour. He likes talking about hypothetical situations, so what about this one? You are the parent of a child. Would you want them to go on a trip knowing that if they are injured owing to a fault on the part of the school, youth club or scouts, they will not get compensated? The Bill creates the impression that this is the Government&#8217;s intention. Or this one: the chairman of a local football team cuts corners when vetting volunteer coaches working with children in the belief that he is protected by the law because in providing coaching for children, he is, to quote clause 2,</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/6">&#8220;acting for the benefit of society&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/7">The ramifications of this Bill are that children risk being more exposed to risk. Is that the Government&#8217;s intention in introducing it?</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/8">If that is not the Government&#8217;s intention, this three-clause Bill will not make any difference to the current state of play, as the former Solicitor-General made clear in his intervention. When assessing negligence claims, courts already take into account whether somebody is doing something for the benefit of society, as is recognised by the impact assessment of the Ministry of Justice. That is why organisations have insurance. Although they may be defendants in a claim, they would not be financially liable and their insurer would pay out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/9">That leads me on to another point. It is interesting that the impact assessment states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/10">&#8220;Insurers and other defendants may gain from slightly reduced aggregate compensation paid and this may feed through to lower insurance premiums.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/11">However, there is no attempt whatsoever to quantify that, and nor is there any undertaking from insurance companies that it will be passed on to customers&#8212;all of which leaves us questioning whether any of that will actually happen in practice, or will insurance companies just end up with higher profits? We all know, by the way, that those companies have donated millions of pounds to the Conservative party&#8217;s coffers over recent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/12">The House must also steel itself for the inevitable last-minute tabling of a slew of Government new clauses and amendments. The Justice Secretary has a very bad habit of doing that. Such proposals get a cursory amount of scrutiny at best, but they are designed to get the good media hit he so craves and to raise a cheer from his beleaguered Back Benchers. We are very alert to the possibility of new things being added to the Bill at later stages.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/13">Short though today&#8217;s Second Reading debate will be, given the paucity of Government speakers, it would be helpful if the Justice Secretary could provide a number</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/14">of reassurances. Will he reassure us that the Government have no intention of watering down the duty on businesses, particularly small firms, to take out employers&#8217; liability insurance, and that there are no plans to make individual employees take out their own insurance as an alternative to employers&#8217; liability insurance?</p>

	<p pid="b.1201.1/1">I appreciate that the Justice Secretary is demoralised because he has not been moved from the Justice Department. When the Prime Minister asked Cabinet members to volunteer Bills and the Justice Secretary put up his hand and said, &#8220;Please, sir, I&#8217;ll put forward a Bill,&#8221; he thought he would have moved on by the time it came to Second Reading, so I am sorry that he has to deal with this pathetic and embarrassing Bill. Given that it is the Justice Secretary&#8217;s Bill, we expected dozens and dozens of his MPs to be present saying what a wonderful Bill it is, but they are not piling up behind him to say so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1201.1/2">The Justice Secretary has claimed that years of work&#8212;that is what he said&#8212;have gone into this pathetic and embarrassing Bill. It confuses important legal concepts and it is not properly thought through, so it could have negative knock-on effects as a result. It lacks an evidence base and seeks to legislate on the back of myths. It will not do what the Justice Secretary claims it will. It is UKIP-friendly, but it is more like something out of &#8220;The Thick of It&#8221;. It does not seem to do anything that the current law&#8212;section 1 of the Compensation Act 2006 &#8212;does not already do.</p>
	<p pid="b.1201.1/3">Members should not just take my word for it. Today&#8217;s briefing by the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, which was mentioned by the former Minister for Civil Society, who has now left the Chamber, says:</p>
	<p pid="b.1201.1/4">&#8220;NCVO does not expect this bill to significantly alter the current law, with similar provisions already made in the Compensation Act 2006.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1201.1/5">Therefore, the only people whom the Justice Secretary could pray in aid say that the Bill will not make a jot of difference. All three main aims of the Bill are covered by that existing legislation. In fact, the MOJ&#8217;s own impact assessment also notes that</p>
	<p pid="b.1201.1/6">&#8220;the courts are already very experienced in dealing with these cases&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1201.1/7">It is a sad indictment of this Government that this is the best they have to offer in the final year of this Parliament, when prisons are in crisis, probation is in meltdown and access to justice is under attack on a daily basis. If the Justice Secretary was told by the Prime Minister that he had to introduce a Bill in this Queen&#8217;s Speech, we would have thought that he might have chosen a better one. What about a victims&#8217; law? He could have used this window to put the rights of victims and witnesses into primary legislation. Instead, we have the SARAH Bill&#8212;a turkey of a Bill, a vacuous Bill&#8212;which, without doubt, is the most embarrassing and pathetic Bill that the Minister of Justice has published since the Department was first formed.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40511" name="Nick Hurd">the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd)</phrase> for his work as a Cabinet Office Minister, particularly on the voluntary sector. He worked extremely hard, with precious little thanks, and was content to do so, despite the fact that all he did achieved, sadly, very little public profile. At least on this occasion, we can thank him very much for all he did. I trust that it will not be long before he is back in government again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202.5/3">As I said at the outset, I am not hugely enthusiastic about this particular piece of legislation. I am concerned that what the Secretary of State said does not reflect the long title, which states that it is a Bill:</p>
	<p pid="b.1202.5/4">&#8220;To make provision as to matters to which a court must have regard in determining a claim in negligence or breach of statutory duty.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1202.5/5">Most of what he said had to do with sending out messages. We all need to send out messages from time to time&#8212;sometimes to ask for help, and sometimes to ask people to pay attention to what we are trying to do. In so far as it went, his speech was no doubt well intended, but it did not, if I may say so, condescend to deal with the Bill as a potential piece of law. If we are to pass or</p>
	<p pid="b.1202.5/6">make laws, they must be coherent. Although I entirely agree with all the sentiments that he uttered this afternoon about reducing the so-called health and safety culture, reducing the easy acceptance of the only answer to a problem being to sue and dissuading ambulance-chasing solicitors from doing this, that or the other, I regret to say that I do not agree that this particular Bill will achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202.5/7">I do not know how many people who are intent on bringing an action, if they are not lawyers themselves, think about pieces of legislation. Let us hope that I am wrong and my right hon. Friend is right, and that when the Bill is enacted, copies of it will be plastered all over doctors&#8217; waiting rooms and other public places, so that no citizen will be tempted to bring a spurious claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.1202.5/8">I would be interested to hear how many High Court or county court actions would have been decided differently had the Bill been in force. It is perfectly true to say that the Compensation Act 2006 covers many of the areas of conjecture that are covered by the Bill. I am not persuaded that the Bill covers any new territory.</p>

	<p pid="b.1203.0/1">The hon. and learned Gentleman is being very generous. I hope that my comments will be helpful. The impact assessment that accompanies the Bill states in paragraph 17:</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.0/2">&#8220;Both the possible reduction in case volumes and the size of any compensation payments are unknown, but are likely to be small.&#8221;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-21b.1203.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40297" speakername="Edward Garnier" colnum="1203"  time="018:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140721/debtext/140721-0002.htm#140721-0002.htm_spnew119">
	<p pid="b.1203.1/1">That is, no doubt, what the impact assessment says. Whether that justifies the bringing into law of the Bill, I rather doubt.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/2">I spoke about the Bill before having read it on the Thursday of the Queen&#8217;s Speech debate. I teased the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government rather rudely by inviting him to provide a definition of &#8220;heroic negligence&#8221;. He heroically tried to provide me with such a definition, but he did not do so. That is not surprising, because I am not entirely sure that there is such a thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/3">I was interested in what my noble Friend Lord Faulks, the Minister of State at the Ministry of Justice, said on <phrase class="date" code="2014-06-09">9 June</phrase> in the debate on the Queen&#8217;s Speech in the other place. He said that the Bill will not change the existing overarching legal framework or leave victims without protection, but that it will provide reassurance and send a strong signal to the courts. To quote directly, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/4">&#8220;They will still need to look at whether a defendant met the appropriate standard of care in all the circumstances of the case.&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/5">I say, in parenthesis, that that is what they do already&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/6">&#8220;Nor will it introduce blanket exemptions to civil liability. There is an important balance to be struck between encouraging participation in civil society and being mindful of the impact that careless or risky actions could have on the very people that the defendant was trying to help. The Bill is not about removing protection and leaving victims without proper recourse in those circumstances. However, it will give valuable and needed reassurance to a wide range of people and send a powerful signal that the courts will take full account of the context of a person&#8217;s actions when determining a negligence claim.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2014-06-09.132"><i>Official Report, House of Lords,</i> 9 June 2014; Vol. 754, c. 132</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/7">I do not think that anybody in either House knows more about the law of negligence than my noble Friend Lord Faulks, who has 40 years&#8217; experience at the Bar dealing predominantly with cases involving negligence</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/8">and public authorities, such as fire authorities. Reading between the lines of what he said&#8212;he will contradict me if I have got this wrong&#8212;he does not have a huge amount of enthusiasm for the Bill. However, I may have misread what he said.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/9">The Bill is more like an early-day motion than a proper statute. I say that because, as the Secretary of State admitted, it is predominantly there to send out a message&#8212;a strong signal. As I have had many opportunities to say in my 22, 23 or 24 years in this House, we should legislate not to send out signals or messages, but to make good black-letter law, so that the courts know what the law is and can apply it, and so that the legal professions know what it is and can advise the public on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/10">My concern is that the contents of the Bill have been within the common law and the ambit of the court&#8217;s appreciation for years and years. In 1954, in the case of Watt <i>v. </i>Hertfordshire County Council, Lord Justice Denning, as he then was, spoke about the balancing act performed by the court when people intervene to help in an emergency, which relates to clause 4. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/11">&#8220;It is well settled that in measuring due care one must balance the risk against the measures necessary to eliminate the risk. To that proposition there ought to be added this. One must balance the risk against the end to be achieved. If this accident had occurred in a commercial enterprise without any emergency there could be no doubt that the servant would succeed. But the commercial end to make profit is very different from the human end to save life or limb. The saving of life or limb justifies taking considerable risk, and I am glad to say there have never been wanting in this country men of courage ready to take those risks, notably in the Fire Service.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/12">What Lord Justice Denning said is as true now as it was in 1954, as I know from the emergency services in my own county of Leicestershire, be it the police, the ambulance service or the fire service. There are plenty of brave people who will risk their own life and limb to save others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/13">I rather agree what my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40134" name="David Nuttall">the Member for Bury North (Mr Nuttall)</phrase> said about the last words of clause 4, which refer to an action taken</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/14">&#8220;without regard to the person&#8217;s own safety or other interests.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/15">I suggest, and I think he agrees, that it is much more heroic to do something having had regard to one&#8217;s own safety or other interests, and to go on and do the brave thing&#8212;rescuing someone from a frozen lake, pulling them out of a burning building or whatever it might be&#8212;despite having thought about those interests. For goodness&#8217; sake, if the Bill is to become law, the least we can do is to remove those last few words of clause 4. Even if it were difficult to work out in law what heroic negligence actually was, we would at least have made that clause a little better.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/16">Nobody will be thanked, least of all a Government Back Bencher, for making a rude speech about a Government Bill, but from time to time, even on a hot day when I would rather be somewhere else, I find it necessary for this House to introduce a degree of common sense into a Bill before the other place gives it a thorough grilling. Far too often, the laws that we pass are the laws of the unintended consequence, and I have a horrible suspicion that if the Bill becomes an Act as it is currently drafted, it will be the subject of derision and confusion, or that even if that does not happen, it will fall into disuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/17">I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to take my remarks in the spirit in which they are intended. I really do share with him and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State the aims that the latter set out quite a few times&#8212; to prevent the abuse of the health and safety culture, to reduce spurious litigation and claims and so on. If I may say so, though, passing a Bill that has a hideous resemblance to an early-day motion rather than a proper Act of Parliament is not the way to do it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1203.1/18">I hope that the Bill will not be the subject of a Division this evening, because I cannot support it. If the Opposition seek a Division I will not join them in the lobby, because I found the manner in which the right hon. Member for Tooting made his speech unattractive, but that is a matter for him. We need to take the Bill away and give it a thorough scrubbing over the summer holidays.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-21b.1205.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" speakername="Jim Shannon" colnum="1205"  time="018:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140721/debtext/140721-0002.htm#140721-0002.htm_spnew120">
	<p pid="b.1205.0/1">It is a pleasure to say a few words about this Bill, and I congratulate the Secretary of State in his absence on bringing it before the House. I support the principle of the Bill. That may come as a bit of a blow to my colleagues in the Opposition and is probably unusual, but I feel that the principles behind the Bill are right, and its theme and thrust appropriate. I am aware that the Bill currently relates only to England and Wales, but I give it my full support and I am both hopeful and confident that in future it will extend to Northern Ireland so that protection is given and awarded to volunteers. I am reminded of the comedy programme back in the &#8217;70s&#8212;you will be much too young to recall it, Madam Deputy Speaker&#8212;called &#8220;Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width&#8221;: do not judge the Bill by the fact that it contains only five clauses; it is important that we judge it on its content.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.0/2">In 2007, a national survey of volunteering found that 47% of people who do not volunteer said that one of the main reasons for their not doing so was the fear of being sued. We are in a very litigious age in which people are sued for the smallest things, sometimes without justification. However, the number of people volunteering is increasing and it is estimated that about 15 million people volunteer every month. That is a fantastic number who contribute on a volunteer basis every month of the year to help very many people. As Members of Parliament, each one of us will be aware of the impact of those volunteers. That is great news, and it is even better that 28% of young people between 16 and 25 volunteer&#8212;something that I know in Northern Ireland is supported and encouraged by schools and universities. Volunteering gives those young people experience and discipline when it comes to making a contribution and giving time each day.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.0/3">I was speaking to my colleague, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40229" name="Gregory Campbell">the Member for East Londonderry (Mr Campbell)</phrase>, about the age of litigation, and I reminded him of a story from back home. It was the Christmas before last and there was terrible snow and ice in the streets in front of the shops. The shopkeepers said, &#8220;Should we clear the ice? We are afraid that if we do so we will find ourselves in a position where if someone falls outside the shop, we will be held responsible.&#8221; It turned out that those shopkeepers cleared the ice anyway and took the chance,</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.0/4">and everything worked out okay. However, their fear was that someone could fall and that they would be held responsible. I suspect that the Bill will address such cases.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.0/5">There are provisions in the Compensation Act 2006 for those caught up in litigation, but I completely support and agree with the aims of this Bill, which are to ensure that the good Samaritans out there, and the thousands of volunteers and charitable groups across the UK, are not put off helping for fear of getting into difficulties. Those thousands of volunteers and charitable groups&#8212;the good Samaritans of this world whom we all know&#8212;are those we need to help. The Bill will ensure that people receive what I believe is a &#8220;fair trial&#8221;, and those who have been acting for the benefit of society will not be punished for their actions or interventions. The Bill will also seek to protect those acting in an emergency.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40153" name="Rebecca Harris">The hon. Member for Castle Point (Rebecca Harris)</phrase> intervened at the beginning of the debate to speak about floods in the south of England and the people who react to emergencies. Will they be held responsible? I hope that the Bill will reassure such people and recognise that they were simply trying to help. Again, there is a clear issue there.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-21b.1206.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40229" speakername="Gregory Campbell" colnum="1206"  time="018:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140721/debtext/140721-0002.htm#140721-0002.htm_spnew121">
	<p pid="b.1206.0/1">My hon. Friend is outlining circumstances of deep winter and people clearing snow, or flooding in south- east England. Does he agree that when dealing with people who voluntarily try to help others, we need to see substantive evidence during the passage of the Bill that the situation will be dramatically different in future?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-21b.1206.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" speakername="Jim Shannon" colnum="1206"  time="018:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140721/debtext/140721-0002.htm#140721-0002.htm_spnew122">
	<p pid="b.1206.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. In his introduction, the Minister&#8212;and, to be fair, the shadow Minister&#8212;made the point that the Bill is trying to achieve much in principle, but will probably need to be firmed up. My hon. Friend is right, but that will come out through the Committee stage, and everyone will have the chance to contribute.</p>
	<p pid="b.1206.1/2">Helping someone in need seems like the natural response, and so it should be on every occasion, but everything has become so bureaucratic these days that people will often cross to the other side of the street&#8212;unlike the good Samaritan in the Bible&#8212;because they fear that they might become part of a conflicting or illegal situation. It is important that people do not turn a blind eye, or develop a Nelson&#8217;s eye, to what is going on. They should continue to have a compassionate interest in people and in what they can do to help.</p>
	<p pid="b.1206.1/3">I fully support this Bill, and believe that it will bring positive changes to the current system. Hopefully, it will encourage the 47% of people who are concerned about volunteering to do so. A number of people had expressed their concerns about volunteering, fearing that it could have an impact on them in the event of litigation. Hopefully, the Bill will address that issue as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.1206.1/4">This Bill will also protect those who are acting in a &#8220;generally responsible way&#8221; when an accident occurs. For example, there are youth leaders who organise numerous events and trips throughout the year for young people. People in such roles do fantastic jobs, which is why I think this is a worthwhile Bill to support.</p>
	<p pid="b.1206.1/5">I was disheartened to hear that some of my colleagues on the Opposition Benches have concerns about the Bill. Hopefully, they are frivolous concerns, and when it comes to discussing the contents of the Bill, they will come together to support it. This Bill is certainly not a waste of time; I believe it is something that people want to see. Given the importance that is placed on voluntary work in this economic climate, particularly for young people&#8212;the Prime Minister has talked about volunteers many times&#8212;it is a vital piece of legislation to introduce, and the benefits will be there for young people as well. The Bill will ensure that further checks and balances will exist for anyone making unmeritorious claims, and as an outcome we expect they will be deterred from making such claims. I hope to see the Bill introduced in Northern Ireland in the not too distant future. Given the large number of volunteers in Strangford, who do a really tremendous, worthwhile job, and whom we could not be without, I would certainly welcome its introduction.</p>

	<p pid="b.1207.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" name="Jim Shannon">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase>. He is right that I will not find the same value in the Bill that he does, but none the less I felt that his speech showed his usual good grace and spirit. He is the archetypal good samaritan in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/2">It is all change in the engine room at the Ministry of Justice, though the captain is still there steering manfully for the rocks as ever. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Where is he?&#8221;] He is rather more like Captain Oates today. I think it does show some disrespect for this House that he did not stay for any speeches, including that of the former Solicitor-General, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40297" name="Edward Garnier">the hon. and learned Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/3">May I, in true bipartisan spirit, congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40339" name="Jeremy Wright">the hon. Member for Kenilworth and Southam (Jeremy Wright)</phrase>, who is not in his place, on his promotion to the role of senior law officer? He will no doubt discharge it with the same calm and rational demeanour that was his hallmark at the Ministry of Justice. Let us hope that he also adopts the robust independence that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40065" name="Dominic Grieve">the right hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Grieve)</phrase> showed in that post.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/4">I also welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40557" name="Andrew Selous">the hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> to the justice team&#8212;it is a shame he is not in his place either. I understand that we are getting only a part of him as, along with being an unpaid Prisons Minister and an afterthought in the reshuffle, he will spend part of his time in the Whips Office. Of course it is an unalloyed pleasure to see the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" name="Shailesh Vara">the hon. Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr Vara)</phrase>, still in his place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/5">This Bill has been described as &#8220;a turkey&#8221;, &#8220;a complete waste of time,&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/6">&#8220;a solution in search of a problem&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/7">and</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/8">&#8220;an unnecessary and wholesale interference with the rights of injured people.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/9">It has been accused of</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/10">&#8220;shifting the blame to workers when they are injured.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/11">It is said to be, &#8220;an erosion of workers&#8217; rights&#8221;, &#8220;nonsense&#8221; and &#8220;gobbledygook&#8221;. It is said to cause confusion about</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/12">&#8220;who is protected from the law and to what degree.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/13">Surely it has some supporters? Well, no, it does not&#8212;not really. The Government pray in aid the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, but the NCVO says it is</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/14">&#8220;not expected to significantly alter the current law.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/15">It says it is &#8220;classic nudge tactics&#8221;. At best, it sends a message and is</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/16">&#8220;unlikely to be able to do any harm.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/17">But then that is the Government&#8217;s view as well. The explanatory notes say that the Bill would not change the overarching legal framework. The Lord Chancellor himself says it is</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/18">&#8220;a signpost from Parliament to the Courts.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/19">Do we really need legislation for that? It is only two stops on the tube to the Royal Courts of Justice. Where are the other representatives of civil society, defendant lawyers and even political allies speaking up for this Bill?</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/20">We heard a thoughtful speech from the hon. and learned Member for Harborough, who quietly but effectively proved there is no justification for the Bill. As we have heard, ConservativeHome described it as a Bill that should not be in the Queen&#8217;s Speech. The Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, is now charged, on behalf of the Lord Chancellor, with weeding out unnecessary laws that clog up the statute book. He could start with this one.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/21">There are only three short operative clauses in the Bill. They instruct a court considering negligence or statutory duty claims to have regard to whether a defendant was acting for the benefit of society, demonstrating a generally responsible approach or acting heroically. The Lord Chancellor claims the Bill will not fetter judicial discretion, but that is all it sets out to do. Fortunately, it is so poorly drafted that it will probably fail in that aim, but it will undoubtedly spark quantities of satellite litigation as the parties seek to define &#8220;benefit of society&#8221;, &#8220;a generally responsible approach&#8221; and &#8220;acting heroically&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/22">First, insofar as it is necessary at all, the purpose of the Bill has already been fulfilled by section 1 of the Compensation Act 2006, which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/23">&#8220;A court considering a claim in negligence or breach of statutory duty may, in determining whether the defendant should have taken particular steps to meet a standard of care (whether by taking precautions against a risk or otherwise), have regard to whether a requirement to take those steps might&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/24">(a) Prevent a desirable activity from being undertaken at all, to a particular extent or in a particular way, or</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/25">(b) Discourage persons from undertaking functions in connection with a desirable activity.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/26">This gives guidance to the court in less ambiguous and florid language than the instant Bill, while retaining discretion. If the Secretary of State disapproves of the Compensation Act, why is he leaving it on the statute book? If he thinks it ineffective, why is he repeating the mistake of legislating in much the same terms? If he thinks it is working, his own Bill must be otiose.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/27">Secondly, the Lord Chancellor has, as usual, adduced no evidence that a new law is necessary. He relies on a survey of 300 people from almost 10 years ago to say that some people are deterred from volunteering by fear of being sued. But the National Council for Voluntary Organisations says only 1% of volunteers stopped because they feared opening themselves to litigation. Last year, the former Minister for Civil Society, the hon. Member</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/28">for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd), issued a press release trumpeting that volunteering was at an all-time high.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/29">Let us look at the problems the Lord Chancellor purports to address in the Bill. The first is:</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/30">&#8220;the person who holds back from sweeping snow off the pavement outside their house because they are afraid that someone will then slip on the ice and sue them&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/31">No one, up to and including the Lord Chief Justice, can point to a case of this kind being brought, let alone succeeding. Indeed, the Government&#8217;s own website, Direct.Gov.uk, used to host a section debunking the snow and ice myth. It said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/32">&#8220;Don&#8217;t be put off clearing paths because you&#8217;re afraid someone will get injured. Remember, people walking on snow and ice have a responsibility to be careful themselves. Follow the advice below to make sure you clear the pathway safely and effectively. And don&#8217;t believe the myths&#8212;it&#8217;s unlikely you&#8217;ll be sued or held legally responsible for any injuries if you have cleared the path carefully.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/33">Curiously, this page was recently removed from the site, but we still have the words of the new Attorney-General, who in 2010 said that</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/34">&#8220;the courts are very unlikely to find the public-spirited domestic snow shoveller negligently liable for any injuries, in the absence of spectacular incompetence.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2010-02-02.171"><i>Official Report</i>, 2 February 2010; Vol. 505, c. 171</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/35">More seriously, the signal that the Government are sending to volunteers in clause 2 is misleading. It implies a lower standard of care is needed by those engaged in altruistic pursuits. Parents may face the fear that if their child is injured on a school trip due to fault with the organisers, they will struggle to get compensation. Parents may well take a dim view that because the negligent organiser failed to use the right safety equipment, they will not receive compensation to help them support their newly injured child. Alternatively, they may boycott the activities the school has arranged. How does that help the school, the parent or the child?</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/36">Secondly, the Lord Chancellor bemoans the</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/37">&#8220;member of the emergency services who feels they can&#8217;t come to the rescue of someone in difficulty because of the fear they will end up in trouble for breaching health and safety rules&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/38">If this is intended to give the green light to anyone, trained emergency service worker or public spirited bystander, to act with less care and a feeling of impunity, it is dangerous. The emergency services have vast experience in how and when to intervene. As the TUC has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/39">&#8220;There is not a shred of evidence that there is a problem. The police, fire and ambulance unions have worked closely with their employers and the HSE to develop guidance which ensures health and safety protection is compatible with emergency situations...There is not a case of anyone being prosecuted for trying to save someone in an emergency situation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/40">The few, but widely reported, cases of systems breaking down require better training and communication, not legislation. The everyday hero is not put off from helping out in a crisis by fears for his or her own safety, so why would they be by fear of litigation? Yet the Bill will give no more legal protection&#8212;so much for clause 4.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/41">Clause 3, while equally vacuous, has a more malign intent. The Lord Chancellor told <i>The Sunday Telegraph </i>yesterday:</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/42">&#8220;This is a Bill that&#8217;s out to&#8230;slay the health and safety culture. It is about trying to restore common sense to the kind of situations which happen all too often and very seldom get to court - where</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/43">somebody has an accident at work, it&#8217;s entirely their own fault, they have got a perfectly responsible employer who has the normal health and safety procedures in place but that person does something dumb, hurts themselves and sues the employer anyway.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/44">In that situation, the court would find against the claimant on liability or quantum. This is a further, though probably ineffectual, attack on the rights of employees, and an attempt to give the whip hand to employers, even in this sensitive area, and to please the Association of British Insurers, whose members are such generous donors to Tory party funds. They hope that claims will be suppressed and individuals driven to self-insure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/45">Once again, where is the evidence? The number of workplace claims has halved in the past 10 years; more than half of claims are for less than &#163;5,000; and 75% are for less than &#163;10,000. It is a myth that negligence cases are easy to bring, and now that the Government have all but abolished strict liability, who is the stronger party in workplace disputes&#8212;the employer, insured and in control of the accident site, or the injured employee, unable to earn their salary and plucking up the courage to sue their boss?</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/46">The case for the Bill is not made out. The Lord Chancellor said he did not need a Bill to dismantle criminal aid or embark upon his disastrous privatisation of the probation service, so why does he need one to tackle what has been overwhelmingly proven to be a matter of education, rather than enforcement? The Bill does nothing to tackle the growing crisis in British prisons or the hundreds of thousands of people going unrepresented in the family courts or lacking the most basic advice where social welfare legal aid has been taken out of scope. The Bill addresses none of the damage the Government have done to the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/47">Rather than stoking unjustified fears, the Government should be tackling the real crisis in our legal system: the steady erosion of our civil liberties and access to justice, which protects the strong and leaves the ordinary citizen without justice or redress.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-07-21b.1210.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40450" speakername="Shailesh Vara" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice"  colnum="1210"  time="018:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm140721/debtext/140721-0003.htm#140721-0003.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.1210.0/1">I thank all hon. Members who have contributed to this debate, whether with speeches or interventions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.0/2">As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Justice indicated in his opening speech, the core aim of the Bill is to ensure that people, especially employers, who generally take a responsible approach towards the safety of others during an activity, feel confident that the courts will take full account of this in the event that they are sued. Employers should not be prevented from growing their businesses by irresponsible employees who seek to harm them financially by bringing unfounded negligence claims. The fear of litigation can force businesses to go further than they need to when planning and managing for health and safety risks, which in turn can have a damaging effect on growth. The Bill should reassure employers who adopt a generally responsible approach towards the safety of others during the course of an activity that the courts will always take full account of the circumstances prior to making a decision on liability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.0/3">The social action clause is part of a wider package to fulfil a coalition agreement commitment. Figures published last year showed that the proportion of people volunteering at least once a year increased from 65% in 2010 to 73% in 2013. This is due partly to the initiatives that we have been backing to support people getting involved in their local communities. For example, the National Citizen Service programme for 16 and 17-year-olds saw 40,000 young people give more than 1 million hours in 2013 to socially useful activities. The Step Up to Serve initiative, launched last November by His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, aims to double the number of young people aged between 10 and 20 participating in social action by 2020. Earlier this year, in April, the Prime Minister launched a new volunteering award called &#8220;Points of Light&#8221;, which recognises outstanding individual volunteers who are making changes in their community and inspiring others.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.0/4">Those are only a few of the initiatives that are happening on a local basis all around the country. The commitment that people show to volunteering is something that they and we can be proud of, but we also know that volunteering rates could be increased further if barriers that deter people from getting involved are removed. That is where the Bill has another important role to play. We want people to feel confident about participating in activities that benefit others without worrying about what might happen if something goes wrong and they find themselves defending a negligence claim in the civil court.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.0/5">The same goes for good Samaritans who might be deterred from intervening to help somebody in an emergency in case they are sued for making the position worse. The perception of legal risk can be a bar to positive action. As the Secretary of State said in his opening remarks, the Bill should provide a valuable reassurance to people who are acting for the benefit of society or intervening in emergencies: that the court will take the context of the person&#8217;s actions into account when reaching a decision on liability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.0/6">As I have said, I am grateful to those who have contributed to this debate, although I must say that I am somewhat disappointed, but not surprised, by the tone adopted by the Front-Bench spokesmen for Her Majesty&#8217;s official Opposition. The hon. Gentlemen ask for examples; I suggest that they need only refer to <i>Hansard</i> to see an example given by their colleague, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40480" name="Alison Seabeck">the hon. Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck)</phrase>, who said in a debate:</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.0/7">&#8220;I once stepped off a bus and found a lady lying on the pavement in front of me. There was a group of people around her, but none of them had done anything. Some of them said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to be sued.&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2014-06-10.489"><i>Official Report</i>, 10 June 2014; Vol. 582, c. 489</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.1/1">The hon. Gentleman says I have given two examples. That is two more than the number of times he has repeated the same question, over and over again. I am sorry that he does not like the answer, but he will have to live with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.1/2">My hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40297" name="Edward Garnier">the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier)</phrase> was quite candid in his comments. I have to say that while I respect his distinguished career in the law and his legal brain power, on this issue I will respectfully disagree with him. What we are trying to do is consolidate the measures elsewhere in the statute book in one Bill. Also, as my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary made clear, we are seeking to send out a powerful message to public: that when they do the right thing, the law will take them into account.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.1/3">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" name="Jim Shannon">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase>, who spoke in support of the Bill. As he rightly put it, we should judge the Bill by its content, not by the number of clauses. He asked whether it would be extended to Northern Ireland. That is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly, as it is a devolved matter, but I will certainly be following with interest to see what progress is made by the Northern Ireland Assembly. It is comforting that he has put on the record his support for the measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.1/4">We need to be clear that there is nothing in the Bill to stop an employee bringing a negligence claim against an employer. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Clearly the paymasters of the Labour party, the trade unions, have been lobbying it hard, as was abundantly clear from the way Labour Members spoke about their friends in the trade unions. The Bill is not designed to reduce standards of health and safety in the workplace or to leave workers without a remedy where they have been injured by the negligent actions of an irresponsible employer. It will, however, provide valuable reassurance to employers who have taken a responsible approach to safety, but end up in court when, for example, an employee suffers an injury that simply could not have been foreseen by any reasonable person. The Bill will send the powerful message that the courts will always consider the employer&#8217;s general approach to safety in the course of the activity in question before reaching a decision on liability.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.1/5">The courts will, of course, need to consider in every case whether someone was acting for the benefit of society or adopting a generally responsible approach to the safety of others in the course of a particular activity. <i>[Interruption.] </i><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40610" name="Sadiq Khan">The right hon.

	<p pid="b.1213.3/1">Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am happy to continue, in a reasoned and measured way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1213.3/2">As I was saying, the courts will need to consider in every case whether someone was acting for the benefit of society or adopting a generally responsible approach to the safety of others in the course of a particular activity. However, as has already been pointed out, the Bill will not preclude them from considering any other relevant factors. It will not give medics, police officers, teachers or anyone else immunity from being found negligent if all the circumstances of the case warrant that. Nor will the Bill have any bearing on criminal liability. If a person&#8217;s conduct amounts to the commission of an offence such as gross negligence manslaughter, there may be criminal as well as civil repercussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.1213.3/3">I believe that the Bill will serve an important purpose in reassuring a wide range of people that the law will treat them fairly, and that they should not let worries over being sued deter them from making a valuable contribution to society. Again, I thank all Members who have contributed today. I simply say to Opposition Members that they should illustrate their observations by their actions.

	<p pid="b.1217.2/1">I am most grateful to have this chance to introduce this Adjournment debate shortly before the summer recess.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/2">Late one February evening five years ago my young constituent, Luke Bland, received a call from one of his closest friends, Ben Blackford. Ben&#8217;s car had been involved in a minor accident and he asked for Luke&#8217;s help to move it. Even though it was a dark night and the conditions were icy, Luke&#8212;a bright 20-year-old who was hoping to join the police&#8212;did not hesitate and went off to help him on the road between Uckfield and Lewes.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/3">At around 1.30 in the morning, having moved Ben&#8217;s car to a safe position off the main road into a side lane, the two young men were walking along the public footpath to meet the police officers who had arrived at the scene. At that moment, another car, a Lotus Exige, came round the corner, out of control. It hit both young men. Luke was hit so hard his body was knocked over a fence and into an icy pond 12 metres away. He died instantly. The Lotus then hit Ben and carried him underneath it, as it careered over the verge, went through a fence and came to a halt in the pond. Ben sustained injuries from which he has not yet recovered, and in all probability never will do.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/4">There are other matters which are not the subject of this debate but which should cause us disquiet, such as the fact that the driver&#8217;s insurers paid for him to have a new car, but there was no claim entitlement for the loss of a young man&#8217;s life. Indeed, in seeking justice Luke&#8217;s family had to spend thousands of pounds of their own money to take on the system.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/5">One could put this down as a tragic accident. For Luke&#8217;s parents, Sally and Peter, and his brother and sister, it was the loss of a much loved son and brother, but could it have been avoided on such an icy night? How could the driver have known that two people would be on the pavement that night? Indeed, that was the outcome of the trial, which found that the driver was not guilty of dangerous driving. However, the more I have looked into this case, the more evident it has become that there has been a terrible miscarriage of justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/6">The driver of the other car was an off-duty police traffic officer, Stewart Chalmers, who was back at work quickly and without a blemish on his record. His destroyed Lotus was replaced, by his insurance company, with a Porsche. His life was back on track. He was back at work as a road traffic officer, stopping other motorists who were breaking the law, perhaps without a valid MOT or insurance. But thanks to dedicated research by the parents of Luke and Ben we know now that that is exactly what Mr Chalmers had himself been doing prior to the accident: driving without a valid MOT or insurance. The issue in this debate is how crimes by police officers are handled and how the rights and interests of the victims can be lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/7">In my 13 years as MP for Wealden, I have met hundreds of Sussex police officers&#8212;we all do this in the course of our work. I have found them exactly as I would hope police officers to be: conscientious, decent, hard-working people who want to make their communities</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/8">safer. But for all those hundreds of good officers, every barrel has, as they say, some rotten apples. As soon as Stewart Chalmers had hit the two young men, those police officers who were already at the scene, having witnessed the accident, ordered him out of his damaged car. It is recorded in witness statements that they soon realised that the Lotus driver was a police officer, and he was ushered into a police vehicle. Had it been any ordinary member of the public involved in a death by driving incident, we would rightly have expected him to be questioned there and then, and indeed taken to a police station for further questioning. However, for reasons we have never established, he was not held for questioning and he was not taken to a police station. Instead, he was taken to be checked out at hospital and then allowed to go home.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/9">In the days following the accident, the inspector in charge went on holiday but, having read the eyewitness statements, he left instructions for Stewart Chalmers to be arrested and questioned. We know that the Police Federation made representations&#8212;&#8220;ferociously&#8221; was the word used&#8212;against his arrest; shockingly, it actually threatened the arresting officer that he would be sued personally if he proceeded. Mr Chalmers was not, therefore, arrested until the inspector returned from holidays and demanded it&#8212;two whole weeks later. That two-week delay allowed Mr Chalmers to come up with a range of explanations for what had happened and why he should not be held responsible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/10">On the night of the accident, Ben&#8217;s mother was called by the hospital where her seriously injured son was unconscious. Luke Bland&#8217;s parents were contacted in the middle of the night, not by the police but by a friend, to be told that their son may have been injured in the accident, too. They were only informed of his death when Mr Bland and his younger son went to the scene some four hours after the accident, fearing for Luke&#8217;s well-being.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/11">The police, and the county&#8217;s excellent new chief constable, Giles York, now readily accept that they should have done many things differently: they should have questioned Stewart Chalmers immediately; they should not have told Mr Bland in front of his 17-year-old younger son Josh that Luke had been killed; they should have given more professional support to the grieving family; they should have been more thorough in their search of the area&#8212;the roof of the Lotus was not even found until Mrs Bland pointed out that it was missing from the vehicle inspection, and she herself found it, still sticking out of the pond; and they should not have escorted Mr Chalmers to his trial in a police car or taken him away at the end, with his lawyer, in a police car with its lights and sirens blazing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/12">My principal concern today, however, is the failure to investigate properly Mr Chalmers&#8217; defence. I believe that the version he told the court was not the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. It has been left to Mr and Mrs Bland and Mrs Browning to unearth the true facts, and in this desperately sad and awful case they should have been able to look to the police to do that. Mr Chalmers said in his sworn police statement, which was referred to in court, that</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/13">&#8220;there had been no occasions when control had been lost&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/14">He explained that the vehicle was serviced two weeks before the crash and was &#8220;in good condition&#8221;. His statement stated he was a careful driver, and indeed his defence rested on that claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/15">Luke&#8217;s parents have discovered that that was not the case. On <phrase class="date" code="2008-10-28">28 October 2008</phrase>, four months before the accident, Mr Chalmers took his car to be MOT-ed at Kwik-Fit in Uckfield. It failed its MOT because its nearside front tyre was below the legal threshold. Had Mr Chalmers been the good custodian he claimed, then surely, especially as a police traffic officer, he would have checked on a regular basis that his tyres were legal, but apparently not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/16">Mr Chalmers was allowed to take the car away to get the tyres replaced, which he did&#8212;eventually. It was three weeks later, on <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-19">19 November</phrase>, that he took the car to Dream Machines in Heathfield to have the tyre replaced, by which time the car had been driven an extra 455 miles. That is 455 miles without a valid MOT and so, by definition, in a car without insurance; that is 455 miles of illegal driving. The car was then given a further MOT, which it passed but only with an advisory notice that that the rear tyres were close to the legal threshold. One might have thought that this time Mr Chalmers would have acted quickly, but no, he continued to drive the car without changing the tyres. By the time of the accident on <phrase class="date" code="2014-02-14">14 February</phrase>, three months later, those rear tyres were indeed below their legal limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/17">No one will ever know if the accident could have been avoided if the tyres had been in a roadworthy condition, but the court case would have been very different. If it had been established that, far from being the responsible driver he claimed, Mr Chalmers drove his car illegally, in an unroadworthy condition, and did not bother to check the legality of his tyres even when warned they were close to the limit, the main line of his defence would have fallen apart.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/18">Mr Chalmers did not tell the Court that he had been issued with an advisory notice and he allowed the assumption to be drawn that he had replaced the worn tyres in November when that related to the front tyre and not the rear tyres, which were the ones in question. After the trial, when this information eventually came to light through the persistence of Mr and Mrs Bland and Mrs Browning, I wrote to the police to ask them to reconsider the case. The response included the following paragraph:</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/19">&#8220;It is possible that the defective tyre was changed immediately on returning from the failed test on 28th October and the vehicle then driven for 3 weeks on legal tyres until its re-test. It is possible someone else drove the vehicle throughout this period. It is possible the additional mileage was driven on a private road or even outside of the United Kingdom&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/20">It went on:</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/21">&#8220;The officer himself denies committing any traffic offences and is unable to account for the usage of the vehicle stating that he cannot recall details from 5 years ago.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/22">It beggars belief that anyone could have written that. Even if Mr Chalmers had allowed someone else to drive his car&#8212;I think anyone with a Lotus would remember if they had lent it to someone else for a period of weeks&#8212;he would still have been responsible for its roadworthiness, or lack of it. We know exactly when Mr Chalmers had his tyre changed, and it was not immediately after the failed MOT, but rather 22 days later, on the very same day as it was retested. As a police traffic officer, how could Mr Chalmers not have known that he was driving illegally?</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/23">As for the suggestion that it could have been driven on private roads for 455 miles, or even taken abroad without Mr Chalmers remembering it, those comments</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/24">are so incredible that they would have been laughed out of court. The police investigation discovered none of this and now that this evidence has been presented to them, they still feel they cannot reopen the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/25">Mr Chalmers still went about his work, stopping and no doubt charging people for this same offence. His Lotus was replaced by a Porsche, and no doubt his insurance company, Elephant, believed him when he said he was a responsible driver. He has put behind him the accident that resulted in Luke&#8217;s untimely death and Ben&#8217;s lasting injuries. He is free to get on with his life.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/26">In the conditions that night, with tyres in perfect condition, the accident might of course still have happened. However, what remains for Mr and Mrs Bland and Mrs Browning is a searing sense that justice has not been done. Justice was not blind, as it seems to have been applied differently to a police officer than it would have been to any other member of the public. A police officer gave partial evidence in a court of law, with no action taken against him.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/27">Four things should happen now. Sussex police should review again the civil case to consider prosecuting Mr Chalmers, or they must explain how they can still have confidence in Mr Chalmers as a serving officer. The Home Secretary should set clear rules for how potential crimes by police officers are investigated to ensure that they are treated no more lightly than crimes by members of the public. Mr Chalmers&#8217; insurance company should instigate its own action to review his insurance claim, and it should award a payment to Mr and Mrs Bland and Mrs Browning for their loss and for the financial costs they have incurred in seeking justice. Also, Mr Chalmers should make a public apology to the families of Luke Bland and Ben Blackford and accept that his policing career is over. He has shown no remorse for what happened on that night or afterwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.1217.2/28">Mr and Mrs Bland have been through every parent&#8217;s nightmare. The strain and stress on them and their two other children, Josh and Lily, have been overwhelming. Together with Mrs Browning, they are three of the most courageous people I have ever met, but they have been ill served by the police and by the justice system. After more than five years, it is time to bring this matter to an end, so that their grieving for their much loved son Luke can begin.</p>

	<p pid="b.1220.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40639" name="Charles Hendry">the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry)</phrase> on securing the debate this evening. As an ex-fireman myself who regularly used to attend such instances, my thoughts and prayers are with the families and particularly with Ben. I hope that my hon. Friend is wrong and that Ben makes a partial, if not a full, recovery.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/2">As the new Policing Minister, I was very concerned when I saw that this debate was due to take place, so I have taken some time to look into the event. It is not for this House to retry the case. With that in mind, I will try to address some of the facts of the case, then the way that the case should have been treated, and finally the four points that my hon. Friend raised. Even though, as my hon. Friend rightly said, the family have since found</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/3">a lot of evidence, there is none to suggest that the accident would not have happened anyway. I think everybody accepts that. I am not responsible for the letter. That is a matter for Sussex police.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/4">Sussex police have acknowledged that their procedures could have been improved. That is right and proper. Interestingly, the Independent Police Complaints Commission carried out an investigation into the complaints made by the family about the conduct of the investigation by Sussex police, and I know that there was some concern about whether Sussex police or another force should have carried out that investigation. I shall come back to that in a moment. The IPCC found that although some of the complaints were well founded, there was no misconduct on the part of the officer. The IPCC is, of course, a completely independent body.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/5">The other fact that I should raise at this point is that the gentleman concerned was an off-duty police officer. Had he been on duty, what happened afterwards would have been completely different. I was not at the scene and I do not have some of the facts that my hon. Friend referred to in his comments, so I will stick to what I know and the information that has been passed to me. The IPCC said that the Sussex police investigation of the incident was conducted thoroughly and effectively, so that part of the complaint referred to by my hon. Friend was not upheld. It is important to note that.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/6">The operational independence of the IPCC from the Home Office and from Ministers is an integral part of our system and we should make sure that no Minister intervenes in its working. Nor should we as Ministers intervene in police investigations. At the heart of my hon. Friend&#8217;s concerns was the investigation of PC Chalmers by his own force. I reiterate that if he had been on duty, the matter may well have been dealt with by another force. In this case, as he was treated as an individual off duty, it was investigated in the same way as a case involving any other member of the public. The fact that he was an off-duty policeman should not, I agree, have precluded Sussex police from investigating the death of Luke Bland and the rest of the incident. The really serious injuries that occurred, in particular to Ben, were taken into consideration when the prosecution decisions were made.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/7">Sussex police&#8217;s criminal investigation led to the prosecution of PC Chalmers. The IPCC found that the case was investigated thoroughly and effectively by Sussex police. Therefore it would appear that the case was treated with at least as much integrity as an investigation of any other member of the public who had been at the wheel. It would also appear that even though prosecution was withdrawn, it was not because Sussex police&#8217;s investigation was at fault.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/8">My hon. Friend makes four suggestions. I think I understand all the points that he is trying to make, even if I cannot agree with them at the Dispatch Box today. The first point&#8212; that Sussex police review again the case&#8212;is clearly a matter for the police force. It is not a matter for a Minister or the Home Secretary. I may not be dealing with these points in the same order as my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/9">The second point is that the insurers should instigate their own action and review PC Chalmers&#8217; claim. That is clearly also a matter for the insurance company. I was</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/10">at the Department for Transport for many years. Insurance companies tend not to pay out unless they have to. They will hate me for saying that, but they do not. They like taking our premiums, but rarely pay out. It is clearly a matter for the insurance company whether to pay for the damage to the car and compensation to the families. It might also be a matter for civil litigation should the families wish to purse that course.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/11">The third point concerns whether the Home Secretary should ensure that police are investigated in the same way as the public. They are, should they be on duty. If they are off duty, they are civilians: they are not doing their job of work, so they are not investigated by the IPCC in the same way. It is right and proper that those who are off duty are off duty, and when they are on duty they are on duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.1220.0/12">Lastly, should PC Chalmers make a public&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1222.0/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for giving way, and I am particularly grateful to him for the sensitive and thoughtful way in which he is responding to the debate. Will he, however, look at the role of the Police Federation in this? When an instruction was left that Stewart Chalmers should be arrested, the Police Federation got involved in a way that was described as &#8220;ferociously&#8221; by the police themselves. They then suggested that if they went ahead and arrested Stewart Chalmers, the police officer doing that would himself be sued personally. That cannot be a level playing field, because that would not happen if it was not somebody who had been a police officer who had done it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1222.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. He must have read my thoughts on the point I was going to come to in my conclusion to this short debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/2">The fourth point&#8212;made, I am sure, on behalf of the family but through my hon. Friend&#8212;is that PC Chalmers should make a public apology. That is a matter for the gentleman concerned and for his own personal thoughts and conscience. I personally cannot in any way instruct the gentleman to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/3">However, because of the comments that have been made in this evening&#8217;s debate, I intend to go away and ask my officials to look into the conduct of individuals from the federation. I do not think we should smear the federation. It is going through a transitional period at the moment. I met the senior management of the federation earlier this afternoon; it was actually a very convivial meeting. They were very much standing up for their members, and in many ways I sympathise with some of the comments that they made, but they are really moving on, and I think in the right direction. However, I will ask my officials to look into the matter regarding the comments that my hon. Friend has made about what the Police Federation representative may or may not have said. I will ask my officials to look into that immediately. If I do not have the powers to do that, I will find someone who does.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/4">With that in mind, I am conscious that this has been a very difficult matter for my hon. Friend to bring before the House. If I was a Back Bencher, I would really have to rack my brains about whether to do so, not because I would have to decide whether standing up for someone was right or wrong, but because the courts have made a</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/5">decision, based on the evidence placed before them. That is the justice system we have in this country and that is the democracy we live in.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/6">With hindsight, and especially given the tone with which my hon. Friend has brought the matter before the House, I think it was right and proper that there was a Minister here to respond, even if on most of the points I do not have the powers to intervene, and nor would I wish to have them. With that in mind, I will take away</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/7">the comments about looking into the Police Federation, and I truly hope that the family can have some peace after the loss of their loved one and that Ben gets better soon.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/8" class="italic">Question put and agreed <i>to</i>.</p>
	<p pid="b.1222.1/9" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
