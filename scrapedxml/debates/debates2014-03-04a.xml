	<p pid="a.733.7/1">As the United Nations has found North Korea to be committing crimes against humanity on a scale unparalleled in the modern world, will the Government refer those responsible to the International Criminal Court and lobby the BBC to broadcast the World Service into North Korea, given the increase in demand for the so-called immoral devices of small radios, the ban on which eased last month?

	<p pid="a.733.8/1">I certainly agree with my hon. Friend&#8217;s last comment. On the International Criminal Court, in principle it could be an appropriate forum, although the DPRK has not signed up to it. We strongly agree that there should be no impunity for crimes of this sort, so we need to look at the most effective way of holding the DPRK to account.</p>

The commission will formally present its report on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-17">17 March</phrase>, so these are very early days. The annual resolution led by the European Union and Japan will then be taken at the end of the Human Rights Council and we will work with colleagues there to ensure that we have the best possible mechanism to hold the DPRK to account. Incidentally, I believe that when the curtain is finally lifted on that country, we will see evidence of human rights violations that surpass anything we have seen in any other country in the past 50 years.</p>

	<p pid="a.735.4/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for that answer and may I pay tribute to him for his extensive efforts during this crisis?

	<p pid="a.735.5/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. That is a very important point. Allegations have been made about threats to the Russian-speaking minority in Ukraine. I must say that I have not seen any evidence&#8212;no evidence has been presented of those threats&#8212;and I received very strong assurances from the Ukrainian authorities yesterday that they would not make any such threats. In any case, as he says, such matters should be resolved peacefully, and institutions such as the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe are always ready to assist with such matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.735.6/1">As a schoolboy, I took the bus from Cwmbran to Pontypool via the village of Sebastopol, a reminder of how long the Crimea has been of significance in our history.

It is of course the Government&#8217;s responsibility to frame this country&#8217;s policy and the Opposition&#8217;s job to hold us to account for that, as the shadow Foreign Secretary often reminds me. I hope that there will be very strong unity about the key aspects and key principles involved in this crisis.

	<p pid="a.736.4/1">I find the hon. Lady&#8217;s question ridiculous in the extreme, and I almost do not know where to begin to ridicule it. Certainly, Her Majesty&#8217;s Government would not be influenced by any such matters. I discussed with the Prime Minister of Ukraine yesterday our eagerness to assist with the return of stolen assets and their recovery for Ukraine. For the first time, the Ukrainian Government yesterday gave us a list of those involved; they had not done so previously. I have agreed with the Prime Minister of Ukraine to send a team urgently to Ukraine to advise the Ukrainians on the information they need to provide to us for us to be able to act on it. I think she can now see how utterly baseless her question was.</p>

Does he agree that it is difficult to take the protestations of President Putin seriously in the light of the incident recently reported about Russian soldiers firing warning shots over the heads of Ukrainian soldiers seeking to go about their lawful business and then threatening to shoot them in the legs if they did not desist?

	<p pid="a.737.0/1">My right hon. and learned Friend makes a very important point. It continues to be a serious risk that deliberate provocation, in particular, could give rise to a dangerous incident.

I urged them yesterday, when I was in Kiev, to maintain that posture through all circumstances and at all times. I believe that they are determined to do so.</p>

However, in the end, this situation will be resolved diplomatically or it will not be resolved, with terrible costs to the whole world. In that context, will he say now or later what his view is on Ukraine&#8217;s ability to have a free trade agreement with Europe, as well as a free trade agreement with Russia? Will that not be part of a diplomatic future?</p>

We believe that those agreements would benefit the economy and people of Ukraine, and the economy and people of Russia.

	<p pid="a.741.0/1">The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights concluded that Sri Lanka&#8217;s failure to address the allegations was fundamentally a question of political will. Was it not incredibly naive of the Prime Minister at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting to believe that President Rajapaksa had any intention of conducting his own inquiry? Given the time that has been wasted by setting a March deadline, what has the Prime Minister done to use the UK&#8217;s position on the Human Rights Council to push for an international investigation, which he should have pushed for many months ago?</p>

Having witnessed the bilateral meeting between the Prime Minister and President Rajapaksa, I assure her that there was nothing naive about it. The Prime Minister forcefully put the case for Sri Lanka to mount its own inquiry and forcefully made it clear that he would press for an international inquiry if it did not do so. That is what he is doing in his contacts with other Heads of Government around the world. I and the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for East Devon, are doing the same with other Foreign Ministers. I hope the Opposition concentrate on supporting that rather than trying to snipe about it.</p>

Whatever kind of Government then come about in Burma will, to my way of thinking, have to recognise some of the differences in the different parts of that country.

Some 13 foreign nationals were killed in the attack I think she is referring to, and it is a great tribute to them all that young people continue to go to Afghanistan and carry out that work.</p>

The offer that Lakhdar Brahimi made to both sides when the talks last ended was that they would discuss terrorism, as the regime describes it, and a transitional governing body, as the Opposition wanted, in parallel. The regime refused to do that, but it needs to become ready to so that for the talks to get going again.</p>

	<p pid="a.749.3/1">Of course the issue of direct flights between London and Ahmedabad is ultimately a commercial decision for airlines, but India hosts the largest UK diplomatic network in the world and we now have a British trade office there. I visited Gujarat and met the state&#8217;s Chief Minister Modi in March 2013, and we would welcome such direct flights because a huge section of the population travels to and does business with that thriving and vibrant part of India.</p>

	<p pid="a.750.5/1">The hon. Gentleman is right that the flow of narcotics from Afghanistan remains a very serious problem that has not been defeated, but of course many other things have been achieved in Afghanistan, and he is losing sight of that in his question. Terrorist bases that were operating for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan have been destroyed, the threat to the world from terrorism originating in Afghanistan is now much less than it was in 2001, and the Afghan people have been able to make</p>

	<p pid="a.755.1/1">With permission I will make a statement on the situation in Ukraine. The House will recall from my statement last Monday that, on <phrase class="date" code="2014-02-21">Friday 21 February</phrase>, former President Yanukovych and the opposition in Ukraine signed an agreement to end months of violence. Shortly afterwards, Mr Yanukovych fled Kiev, the 2004 constitution was restored, early presidential elections were called for <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-25">25 May</phrase>, and an interim Government were appointed.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/2">Last Wednesday, President Putin ordered military exercises involving a stated 38,000 Russian troops near the border with Ukraine. By Friday, unidentified armed men had appeared outside airports and Government buildings in Crimea. On Saturday, President Putin sought and received the approval of the upper House of the Russian Parliament to use Russian armed forces anywhere on the territory of Ukraine, without the consent of the Ukrainian Government, citing a</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/3">&#8220;threat to the lives of Russian citizens&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/4">Russian forces in Crimea went on to take control of Ukrainian military sites, including in Belbek, Balaclava and Kerch, and to establish full operational control in Crimea. Helicopters and planes have been deployed. The Russian Government have not ruled out military action in other parts of Ukraine&#8212;indeed, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence has reported Russian fighters infringing Ukrainian airspace over the Black sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/5">Her Majesty&#8217;s Government condemn any violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, which contravene Russia&#8217;s obligations under the UN Charter, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe Helsinki Final Act and the 1997 partition treaty on the status and conditions of the Black sea fleet with Ukraine. Under that agreement, Russia is entitled to station troops and naval personnel on its bases in Crimea, but not to deploy troops outside those bases without the permission of the Ukrainian Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/6">Moreover, Russia&#8217;s actions are in breach of the Budapest memorandum, signed in 1994. In return for Ukraine&#8217;s giving up its nuclear weapons, Russia joined the United Kingdom and the United States in reaffirming its obligation to</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/7">&#8220;refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine, and that none of their weapons will ever be used against Ukraine except in self-defence or otherwise in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/8">The Russian Government have argued that there is no legitimate Government in Kiev, but the incumbent Ukrainian President abandoned his post, and the subsequent decisions of the Ukrainian Parliament have been carried by large majorities, required under the constitution&#8212;including from members of the former President&#8217;s party, the Party of Regions. The suggestion that a President who has fled his country then has any authority whatever to invite the forces of a neighbouring country into that country is baseless.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/9">Russia has also argued that Russian-speaking minorities in Ukraine are in danger, but no evidence of that threat has been presented. Furthermore, international diplomatic mechanisms exist to provide assurance on the situations</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/10">of national minorities, including within the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Council of Europe. These mechanisms, not the breaking of international agreements and the use of armed force, are the way to secure assurances of protection of the rights of minorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/11">I commend the Ukrainian Government for responding to this extreme situation with a refusal to be provoked. The Ukrainian armed forces have been placed on full combat readiness, but the Ukrainian Government have affirmed that they will not use force, and I have urged them to maintain this position. However, there is clearly a grave risk of escalation or miscalculation and a threat to hard-won peace and security in Europe.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/12">This Government have been in constant contact with the Government of Ukraine, with the United States, with our partners in the European Union and with our allies in NATO and the G7&#8212;and, indeed, with the Russian Government themselves. Our objectives are, first, to avoid any further military escalation, and instead to see Russia return its forces to their bases and respect Ukrainian sovereignty; secondly, for any concerns about Russian-speaking minorities in Ukraine to be addressed by means of negotiations, not force; and thirdly, for the international community to provide Ukraine with urgent economic assistance, provided that it is ready to carry out vital reforms. I will briefly take each of these areas in turn.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/13">First, we and our allies have condemned Russia&#8217;s military intervention in Ukraine and warned against any further escalation. The Prime Minister has spoken twice to President Obama, and I have been in daily contact with my counterparts in the European Union, NATO and the G7. We have made firm representations to Russia. The Prime Minister spoke to President Putin on Friday, and I spoke to Foreign Minister Lavrov on Saturday, when the Russian ambassador to London was summoned to the Foreign Office. We have urged Russia to meet its international commitments and to choose a path out of confrontation and military action.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/14">At our request, the UN Security Council held an urgent meeting on Sunday. Members of the council called for international monitors to be sent to Ukraine to observe the situation and stressed the importance of Ukraine&#8217;s territorial integrity and the need to lower tensions. NATO&#8217;s North Atlantic Council met on Sunday, and called for Russia to withdraw its troops to bases and to refrain from further provocative actions in Ukraine, in line with its international commitments. The NATO-Ukraine Commission was also convened.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/15">Yesterday, at the Foreign Affairs Council, European nations strongly condemned Russia&#8217;s acts of aggression, called on Russia immediately to withdraw its forces to the areas of their permanent stationing, and without delay to agree to the request by Ukraine for direct consultations with Russia as well as under the Budapest memorandum. The council stated that in the absence of de-escalating steps by Russia, the European Union will decide about consequences for relations between the EU and Russia, such as suspending bilateral talks with Russia on visa matters, and considering targeted measures. Heads of Government will meet at a European Council on Thursday. As the Prime Minister and President Obama have said, there must be significant costs to Russia if it does not change course on Ukraine.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/16">EU member states have reconfirmed the offer of an association agreement with Ukraine, including a deep and comprehensive free trade area, and confirmed our commitment to support an international assistance package to support Ukraine, based on a clear commitment to reforms. The Council also agreed to work on the adoption of restrictive measures for the freezing and recovery of misappropriated Ukrainian assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/17">In terms of immediate steps to respond to Russia&#8217;s actions and acting in concert with the G7, we have withdrawn the UK from preparations this week for the G8 summit in Sochi in June. We will not send any UK Government representatives to the Paralympic games beginning this week, while maintaining our full support for the British athletes taking part.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/18">Secondly, we are urging direct contact between the Ukrainian and Russian Governments. We are willing to pursue any diplomatic avenue that could help to reduce tensions, so we have called for urgent consultations under the Budapest memorandum, or the creation of a contact group including Russia and Ukraine. We urge Russia to accept the invitation to attend talks under the Budapest memorandum in Paris tomorrow, which I will attend.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/19">The UK supports the powerful case for the deployment of UN and OSCE monitors to Crimea and other areas of concern in Ukraine given the grave risk of clashes and escalation on the ground. We are taking part in urgent consultations in Vienna. We welcome the Ukrainian Government&#8217;s support for such deployments and we call on Russia to follow suit.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/20">The Prime Minister and I have both spoken to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to urge him to use the UN&#8217;s authority to bring about direct contact between Russia and Ukraine, and to urge the peaceful resolution of this issue. I welcome the fact that the deputy Secretary-General is in Ukraine today.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/21">Thirdly, we are working to support the Ukrainian Government, who are facing immense political and economic challenges on top of the invasion of their territory. Yesterday, I returned from Kiev, where I encouraged Ukraine&#8217;s leaders to make a decisive break with the country&#8217;s history of pervasive corruption, failed IMF programmes and poor governance. I urged acting President Turchynov and Prime Minister Yatsenyuk to continue to take measures that unify the country and protect the rights of all Ukraine&#8217;s citizens, including minority groups. I welcome the steps they have taken, including the appointment of new regional governors in Russian-speaking regions, and the veto of recent proposed legislation affecting the status of the Russian language.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/22">In return for urgent commitments and reforms, it is vital that Ukraine receives international financial and technical assistance. The International Monetary Fund should be front and centre of any programme of assistance, an approach I discussed with the IMF in Washington last week, and it sent officials to Kiev yesterday. G7 Finance Ministers have issued a statement declaring our readiness to mobilise rapid technical assistance to support Ukraine in addressing its macro-economic, regulatory, and anti-corruption challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/23">The EU has also previously committed &#8364;610 million in financial assistance to Ukraine, which could be made available once an IMF programme has been agreed. In the longer term, through the European Investment Bank,</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/24">the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and neighbourhood funding, the EU will continue to provide significant support to Ukraine.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/25">For our part, as I informed the Ukrainian Government yesterday, we will provide immediate technical assistance to Ukraine to support elections and assist with reforms on public financial management, debt management, and energy pricing. We are exploring further UK expertise to assist with programmes to tackle corruption, reform the labour market, and improve the investment climate in Ukraine, and a British team is already in Kiev to co-ordinate these efforts. We have also offered assistance on asset recovery. I agreed with the President of Ukraine yesterday to send a team to assist Ukraine to provide the information we need to recover stolen assets, and to address this problem more widely.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/26">Over the past four years, the Government have sought and secured an improved relationship with Russia, and we continue to work with Russia on immense global issues such as the nuclear negotiations with Iran, and to try to make progress towards peace in Syria.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/27">The UK&#8217;s national interest lies in a free, democratic, unified, stable and peaceful Ukraine able to make its own decisions about its future. We will continue to do everything we can to support the diplomatic resolution of all the issues I have described, exercising our responsibilities as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and working closely with the nations of NATO and the European Union. We will continue to discuss the situation directly with Russia&#8217;s leaders.</p>
	<p pid="a.755.1/28">But we also have a direct national interest in the maintenance of international law, the upholding of treaty obligations, the sovereignty and territorial integrity of independent nations, and the diplomatic resolution of conflicts that affect the peace and security of us all. For that reason, it is important that there is a clear response to these events, and that they are not repeated, and that is what we will pursue with determination in the days and weeks ahead.</p>

	<p pid="a.758.0/1">I thank the Foreign Secretary for his statement and for advance sight of it this morning.</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/2">This crisis represents the most serious threat to European security in decades. Russia&#8217;s actions are a clear and unambiguous violation of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine. There can be no justification for this dangerous and unprovoked military incursion. None the less, the Ukrainian Government are indeed to be commended, as the Foreign Secretary has done, for their calm response to this severe provocation.</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/3">The immediate priority must now be diplomatic action to secure a de-escalation of the crisis. Achieving this requires the international community to show both unity and resolve in pursuit of a twin-track approach aimed at stabilising the current situation. First, the international community needs to alter the calculus of risk in the minds of the Russian leaders by developing a graduated hierarchy of diplomatic and economic measures that make clear to the Russians the costs and consequences of this aggression. At the same time, the international community must make it clear to Kiev that the new Ukrainian Government must be inclusive, protect the</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/4">rights of Russian-speaking populations within Ukraine, and make it clear to Russia that strengthening ties between Ukraine and the European Union should not be seen as a zero-sum game that will necessarily prejudice its own bilateral relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/5">The obligations on Russia are clear, but so too must be the consequences of inaction. Yesterday&#8217;s decision at the EU Foreign Affairs Council to suspend further talks on the EU-Russia visa liberalisation programme was an important initial step, but will the Foreign Secretary inform the House whether the UK was advocating further diplomatic measures beyond that?</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/6">It is right that the EU Council has called an emergency session for Thursday, but given yesterday&#8217;s events in Downing street, it is also right that there is more clarity from the British Government, ahead of that meeting, about the types of costs and consequences that they are willing to impose on Russia. So will the Foreign Secretary reaffirm specifically that for the United Kingdom not only all diplomatic but all economic options do indeed remain on the table going into the talks on Thursday? I am afraid that the United Kingdom&#8217;s words will count for little without more credence being given to these options and a willingness at least to countenance their use in the days and weeks ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/7">The House should understand that the costs and consequences to the European Union of not achieving unity and resolve at this time are clear: a Russia emboldened in its ambitions towards Ukraine; a central Europe fearful of future military intervention; and a United States increasingly concerned about Europe&#8217;s willingness to act, even diplomatically and economically, in the face of such threats. Therefore, as well as pulling out of the Sochi G8 preparatory meetings, will the Foreign Secretary specifically confirm whether the UK remains open to withdrawing from that June summit?</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/8">Alongside diplomatic pressure, it is also right that the international community gives appropriate assurances to both sides about the potential dividends of avoiding a descent into further violence. Recent estimates suggest that the Ukrainian Finance Ministry needs $35 billion of support over the next two years in order to avoid economic collapse. I welcome the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s announcement today of technical assistance for economic and political reform in Ukraine and, of course, he has previously highlighted the very serious and real concerns about ongoing corruption in Ukraine. However, given the acknowledged weakness of the present Ukrainian Government, will the Foreign Secretary confirm whether, in his judgment, the IMF will be able to respond in a timescale that avoids the present security crisis being rapidly followed by a financing crisis in Kiev?</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/9">Russia&#8217;s incursion into Ukraine was, of course, unjustified and illegal, but the Ukrainian Government none the less have a key role to play in helping to diffuse the situation by providing the appropriate assurances to Russia about their conduct, intentions and priorities. That includes being clear about the status of minorities in the country, the attitude to the Russian language and the conduct of fresh elections in the months ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/10">Will the Foreign Secretary set out what specific assurances he sought from the Ukrainian Government during his welcome visit to Kiev yesterday regarding the status of minorities and in particular the Russian language, given</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/11">the steps previously passed and then vetoed by the Ukrainian President? It is vital, as the Foreign Secretary has indicated, that these assurances are given as part of an open and direct dialogue between Kiev and Moscow. Indeed, a contact group may certainly have a constructive role to play.</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/12">The inviolability of Ukraine&#8217;s borders and territorial integrity reflects deeply held principles of the international system. The situation on the ground certainly remains tense, uncertain and, indeed, vulnerable to misunderstanding or misjudgment. That is why this is a time for cool heads and considered words.</p>
	<p pid="a.758.0/13">As upholders of that international order, the United Kingdom and our allies have responsibilities that extend beyond regard for each individual country&#8217;s bilateral relations with Russia. The Ukraine crisis is surely a moment of real geopolitical significance, so the United Kingdom must not now retreat into a new isolationism and should instead keep all diplomatic and economic measures open to us and our partners as we work to achieve unity and resolve in the international community&#8217;s diplomatic response, and so contribute to the de-escalation of the crisis.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.760.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40499" speakername="William Hague" colnum="760"  time="012:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0001.htm#140304-0001.htm_spnew110">
	<p pid="a.760.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman called for all diplomatic measures to be used, which, as he and the House will have gathered from my statement, is absolutely what we are doing. Indeed, I think from his questions that there is very strong agreement about the gravity of the threat and the principles that should guide us in responding to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.760.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman spoke, as I have done frequently over the past few days, about the violation of Ukraine&#8217;s independence and sovereignty. Like me, he commended the Ukrainian Government on their restraint. I certainly urge them to continue with that and to continue to do everything they can to show that they are being inclusive within Ukraine and that there is no threat to Russian-speaking or other minorities. Indeed, I put it to them yesterday that they could consider positively additional changes to language laws to give an extra assurance. I very much welcome the decision of the acting President not to allow any laws that infringe in any way on the Russian language to go ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.760.0/3">On the subject of the Ukrainian Government, the right hon. Gentleman asked whether I thought the IMF would be able to respond. I think there is strong recognition among the Ukrainian Ministers I met that they need to do something quite different economically and that they have to tackle the deep-seated issues that I described in my statement. I think it is entirely possible that the IMF will be able to respond, although possibly in a two-stage process, with the second stage following the elections on <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-25">25 May</phrase>. I met three of the likely presidential candidates while I was there&#8212;they are not in the Government, but they are likely to run for President&#8212;and I encouraged all of them to support economic reforms, including an end to corruption and much greater transparency in government in Ukraine. I think there is a reasonable prospect of agreeing a programme on the basis of such commitments.</p>
	<p pid="a.760.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman welcomed the initial step&#8212;I think that is the right way to describe it&#8212;taken at the Foreign Affairs Council. Certainly, the United Kingdom has strongly advocated that we need to be ready to take further actions. Those actions, however, must be on a</p>
	<p pid="a.760.0/5">united basis and, of course, be well judged and well targeted. Therefore, I do not think it would be helpful for different countries to announce ahead of the European Council what they want to see. It is important that the European Council agrees a united position and whatever measures it decides to take on Thursday.</p>
	<p pid="a.760.0/6">The right hon. Gentleman asked whether all diplomatic and economic options remain on the table, and the answer is yes, as we discussed during oral questions earlier. No partially photographed documents should be taken as any guide to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government&#8217;s decisions on these matters. Those options remain open.</p>
	<p pid="a.760.0/7">The right hon. Gentleman asked about the June summit. We have suspended the preparations for it. As I told the media yesterday, the G7 will be able to hold meetings of our own if that suspension continues and that, of course, is an option. It will be necessary not only to take well-judged measures in our response, but for there to be recognition across the European Union that Russia needs the EU economically just as much, or more, than the EU needs Russia. We need to have the common political will and to organise ourselves in a sufficiently cohesive way in order to have the political will and economic leverage in future to make that much clearer than it is today. I think that doing that may be one of the longer-term consequences of what Russia has done in Crimea.</p>

	<p pid="a.761.0/1">May I put it to the Foreign Secretary that Brussels is partly to blame for this Ukrainian crisis? If the already over-enlarged European Union is going to continue to try to extend its borders towards Mongolia, we will indeed finish up with a third world war. Every Russian knows that the capture of Crimea and Sevastopol was the greatest achievement of Catherine the Great&#8212;that is why she is called &#8220;Great&#8221;&#8212;and Potemkin. No Russian Government of whatever political complexion could ever give up Crimea or Sevastopol, and we can be absolutely certain that the Russian people are passionately in support of President Putin over this issue.</p>

	<p pid="a.761.1/1">I differ with my right hon. Friend a little bit on this. Russia gave Crimea to Ukraine in 1954 and followed that in the 1990s with a series of specific agreements, including the Budapest memorandum and the 1997 agreement on the Black sea bases, in which it forswore the use of armed force or intrusion on to the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Russia chose to do that and it must honour its international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="a.761.1/2">I assure my right hon. Friend that it is not the ambition of the EU, or of the UK for the EU, to extend its borders to Mongolia. What we are talking about is not Ukrainian membership of the European Union, but free trade; a free trade agreement&#8212;an association agreement&#8212;between the EU and a country that freely chose to enter into negotiations about it. It should not be possible for any other country to have a veto over any nation choosing to do that.</p>

	<p pid="a.761.2/1">May I commend the work of the Foreign Secretary, and the wise approach of my right hon. Friend the shadow Foreign Secretary? The Foreign Secretary will be aware that there is a very different narrative in Russia to justify actions that we all regard as completely unjustified. One issue on which</p>
	<p pid="a.761.2/2">the Russian Government have seized is the decision of the Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, to seek to change the law guaranteeing regional languages, including Russian. I welcome the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s commendation of the interim President&#8217;s veto of that law, but would it not be better to pressure the new interim Government into repealing the legislation altogether? As long as it remains on Ukraine&#8217;s statute book, it will be a running sore, and it will be used by the Russian Government as a means of justifying their intervention.</p>

	<p pid="a.762.0/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman. Just to be clear, the repeal of the law has not gone on to the statute book: the President vetoed it. However, I agree with the thrust of his question, which is that there may well be more that the Government can do to give assurances on that matter, and to make sure that they have language laws entirely satisfactory to all minorities in Ukraine. I put it to the Prime Minister yesterday that that should be one of the things they work on, and we will encourage the Government of Ukraine to do so.</p>

What those actions&#8212;there is a parallel with Transnistria as well&#8212;have in common is that they can be seen as attempts to impair and permanently obstruct the proper operation or the free and democratic functioning of those countries and of their co-operation with Euro-Atlantic structures. There has been a clear pattern of behaviour towards Moldova and Georgia, and it is now being repeated in Ukraine.</p>

However, is it not the case that a large majority of people in Crimea feel a strong attachment to Russia? We all know about Khrushchev&#8217;s impulsive action of handing Crimea over to Ukraine in 1954, when both places were part of the Soviet Union. If we want to de-escalate the crisis&#8212;surely we are not talking about a second Crimean war&#8212;is it not possible to find out through the democratic process, difficult as it is, what the people of Crimea want?

There is a Russian-speaking majority in Crimea, although it is of the order of 50% to 60%, but there are also important minorities, including the Tatar minority, and their rights need to be respected as well. It is too simplistic an approach to say that the majority in Crimea would like to be in a different situation from the current one. Any referendum that is held should be consistent with the constitution of the sovereign nation of Ukraine. That is not the current proposal.</p>

	<p pid="a.767.1/1">As I mentioned before, our options are open. I stress again that any measures must be well judged and well targeted, and that the European Union and the western world must be united. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40455" name="James Gray">the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray)</phrase> is right to point to what happened on the Moscow stock exchange and to the value of the Russian currency yesterday. There are major risks for Russia economically. I expressed the view a few moments ago that, in the medium to long term, Russia needs the economic co-operation of European nations just as much as or more than they need the co-operation of Russia. That has to become part of Russia&#8217;s calculations in the coming years.</p>

	<p pid="a.767.2/1">Given President Putin&#8217;s increasing international and domestic malevolence, is there not a danger that the west will get caught between saying strong words and taking no action on the one hand and, on the other hand, allowing Russia&#8217;s legitimate interests, such as its interest in the port of Sevastopol and its Mediterranean port, and its economic interests, to provide some spurious legitimacy for his actions? Is there not a case, therefore, for a new more global deal that addresses the legitimate Russian interests&#8212;although not the illegitimate ones&#8212;but protects self-determination around Russia&#8217;s border? That might provide some comfort to the President, and more importantly to the people, that NATO has limited ambitions around Russia&#8217;s border, because I think that that is part of the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.767.3/1">We must be alert to the dangers to which the right hon. Gentleman correctly refers, and we must be prepared to be imaginative about long-term frameworks and solutions. We have already made the argument&#8212;I made it only a week ago to Foreign Minister Lavrov&#8212;that we recognise those Russian interests and are not seeking a zero-sum strategic game, and that there will be ways for the Russian economy, as well as the Ukrainian economy, to benefit from closer ties to the European Union. However, the response to us and other countries making that argument has been what we have seen over the past few days. That does not stop our making it, but it shows how difficult it is to construct a global deal, as the right hon. Gentleman said.</p>

One is the deployment of monitors to try to avoid the flashpoint we have been talking about.

We are also working on the creation of a contact group to try to open a new diplomatic channel and a forum for Russia and Ukraine to discuss things together.

	<p pid="a.768.2/1">Given what the Foreign Secretary said about his recognition of the sensibilities of Russia in this situation, does he recognise that the EU&#8217;s ambitions for the Eastern Partnership and the association agreement over the past 18 months have borne some responsibility for the relationship between Russia and Ukraine? That is especially so given, for example, the express views of an EU diplomat last November, who stated&#8212;even threatened&#8212;that the Ukrainian leadership would have to come to the EU on their knees if they did not do what the EU wanted.</p>

	<p pid="a.768.3/1">We are talking about an association agreement that remains on the table between the EU and Ukraine, and a deep and comprehensive free-trade area. That is similar to something that Ukraine would willingly enter into. There is no requirement from the EU that it does that, and it is a very different thing to EU membership. It was being discussed with the Yanukovych Administration, because they wanted to discuss it with the European Union. I assure my hon. Friend that from everything I have seen in Ukraine, having been there on Sunday and Monday, there is strong political unity in that country that welcomes seeing the back of President Yanukovych, and that wants to enter into closer association with the European Union. That is its sovereign right and decision, and we should be prepared to defend its right to make those decisions.</p>

We are one of the few NATO countries that maintains spending of 2% of our GDP, and there are countries across NATO that need to re-evaluate that and increase their defence spending in the coming years.</p>

As we have heard, it invaded and still occupies a part of Georgia; after a few diplomatic rumblings around the world, everything went back to normal. That gave the Russians the impression they can go on doing that with impunity, which is exactly what they have done. Therefore, I urge my right hon. Friend to push for the toughest possible economic sanctions, particularly at Thursday&#8217;s European Council. That is the only lesson the Russians will learn.

	<p pid="a.771.4/1">My right hon. Friend makes his point well. That is why it is important that there are costs and consequences for what has occurred. I cannot add to what I said earlier on measures we can take and how they must be well judged and well targeted, but Russia&#8217;s action will lead, over the coming years, to European nations assessing their interests differently. It will have long-term consequences for Russia&#8217;s relationship with the rest of Europe. That should be of concern to the Russians, whatever measures we can take in the short term.</p>

Does the Foreign Secretary agree that the realities of the UK&#8217;s and Europe&#8217;s dependency on Ukraine and Russia make it crucial, as we set energy policy for the next Parliament, that, in addition to hitting the EU&#8217;s green targets, we put our energy security and the geopolitical implications of it at the top of the agenda?</p>

	<p pid="a.772.4/1">That is an important point and a difficult one for the Ukrainian authorities, because Russian state television is broadcast in many regions of Ukraine, where people therefore hear only one partial side of the argument. From what I could see, the Ukrainian authorities are taking every step to correct misinformation whenever they can and are giving maximum information to the world&#8217;s media. However, this is one of those occasions when it is important for people to use social media and listen to different sources of information, because they will not receive the truth from just one source.</p>

	<p pid="a.772.6/1">That too is important. It is one of the reasons we want Ukraine and Russia to be able to talk to each other about the diplomatic settlement of these issues. The position is very complex, given the range of minorities in Crimea. It is currently impossible for people to leave, because road and air access to and from Crimea is now extremely difficult. There could also</p>
	<p pid="a.772.6/2">be very serious medium-term implications. This is another strong argument for Russia to engage with a contact group, or in consultations under the Budapest memorandum, rather than allowing the problem to build up over the coming weeks.</p>

That is no doubt an emboldening factor, but I think Russian policy has also been driven by the imperative I referred to a few moments ago of trying to alleviate, or reverse in some way, the major setback for Russian foreign policy that took place only 10 days ago in Ukraine, and also possibly by the desire&#8212;which I referred to much earlier&#8212;permanently to impair the free and democratic operation of Ukraine and its Euro-Atlantic aspirations.

The reaction of the world over the long term will tend to diminish the influence of Russia in the world. This will also, of course, shed new light on Russia&#8217;s insistence on sovereignty in other international disputes.

	<p pid="a.781.1/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. On <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-05">5 November</phrase>, in a Westminster Hall debate, the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40156" name="Daniel Poulter">the hon. Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich (Dr Poulter)</phrase> stated unequivocally that hepatitis C is not a curable condition. It has been drawn to my attention by the Hepatitis C Trust and a number of others that the Minister may have inadvertently misled Parliament, because with current treatments the cure rates are about 70%&#8212;or even higher, according to the NHS Choices website. Hepatitis C is a hugely overlooked and under-diagnosed condition, and I seek your guidance, Mr Speaker, on how we can have the record corrected so that the public are not misled by the Minister&#8217;s comments.</p>

	<p pid="a.781.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point of order. My response to him, a persistent fellow, is twofold. First, all Members have responsibility for the veracity of the statements they make in the Chamber. In the event that an error is made, it is incumbent upon the Member, be they a Back Bencher or a Front Bencher, a Minister or an Opposition Member, to correct the record. Secondly, on the strength of what I have heard, and I use those words advisedly, it seems to me that this is, in essence, a matter of political debate.</p>

He asks my advice and my advice to him is that he should be persistent&#8212;I am not sure he needs this advice&#8212;and repetitive. Doubtless he will find other opportunities to raise his point, courtesy of the use of the Order Paper. He has been doing it for the past nearly four years and there is no reason to suppose that he will change the habits of what, thus far, has been his parliamentary lifetime.</p>

	<p pid="a.782.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to regulate the selling of tickets for certain sporting and cultural events; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/3">The Bill I am proposing today speaks to anyone who has loved something enough to want to see it live. For me, that is rugby. In 2015, this country will host the rugby world cup, one of the premier events in the sporting calendar. On the field, our teams will be doing their best to bring the cup to these shores, but who will be cheering them on from the stands? In an ideal world, the most committed fans will be rewarded with a chance to see a once-in-a-lifetime event&#8212;Wales becoming rugby world cup champions.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/4">Many fans will be forced to pay sky-high prices in a rigged secondary market. I used to believe that ticket buying was a fair lottery where a quick phone call or a mouse click would give someone the chance to see their heroes. Unfortunately, all too often, the true fans do not stand a chance. The touts have evolved from blokes in sheepskin jackets lurking outside stadiums trying to sell spare tickets to becoming sophisticated people, harvesting thousands of tickets just seconds after they go on sale. These people have been described as power sellers. Using multiple credit cards and sometimes computer programmes called &#8220;botnets&#8221;, they are able to make thousands of attempts to get tickets each second, manipulating the market and claiming large pools of tickets.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/5">This is a story that has been repeated across the country. Monty Python fans discovered that just three months ago. The much-anticipated comeback show sold out in 43.5 seconds. In 2012, the Rolling Stones attacked secondary sites after sky-high prices&#8212;up to &#163;1,300 a ticket&#8212;meant that their 50th anniversary tour was littered with empty seats. Even the Chelsea Flower Show is not immune. Prince Harry&#8217;s attendance in 2013 saw record ticket sales, with &#163;22 tickets going for as much as &#163;466.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/6">This Bill calls for two things. The rugby world cup should be designated an event of national significance, and it should be illegal to resell tickets for profit. For all other events, there should be a cap on the amount for which a ticket can be resold. We are letting down the fans by not giving them a chance of a fair deal. We must call time out, and stop new internet spivs fleecing honest fans.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/7">To see what sort of prices the secondary sites command, I took a look at the prices for a rugby world cup game that I will be watching with great interest&#8212;Wales&#8217; victory over England. Tickets are not even on sale yet, although the organisers have said that they will range from &#163;75 for the cheaper seats to &#163;315. However, a quick search on Google turned up a range of prominent secondary sites already offering tickets at prices ranging from &#163;920 to &#163;1,725. That kind of ticket touting is parasitic. It leeches off fans who are desperate to see their heroes and organisations that are charging fair prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/8">The Rugby Football Union tells me that it puts every earned penny back into the game. It has ambitions to grow the sport as part of the rugby world cup legacy, just as the Olympics inspired our next generation of superstars. However, these grossly inflated ticket prices will not result in a single extra ball for a school's kit bag.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/9">I have heard the argument that resales do not cost the event organisers a penny, as they have already earned the face value of the ticket. That could not be further from the truth. Kilimanjaro Live, an events promotion company, estimates its costs of policing resale of tickets to be more than &#163;100,000 a year. The National Theatre spends tens of thousands a year, as does the RFU. The misleading nature of online ticket touting means that many people buy tickets believing that they are coming from fellow fans. The first web page they come to may be a secondary sales site and the uninitiated could believe that they are buying from the only outlet or paying a fair price, when really they are being ripped off. Unfortunately, despite evidence of touting in the secondary market, the Government refuse to designate the rugby world cup 2015 as a competition of national significance as was done for the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/10">Designating the games in such a way would make it illegal to resell tickets for the tournament. It is urgent that the Government act to protect genuine rugby fans from being exploited by online rip-off merchants. Tickets for the rugby world cup 2015 will be sent to rugby clubs in May and go on general sale this autumn. Even at this late stage, if the Government were to bring forward legislation to make the rugby world cup an event of national significance, Labour would give them their support.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/11">Before I finish I would like to place on the record my thanks to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40636" name="Sharon Hodgson">the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)</phrase> and other colleagues in the all-party group on ticket abuse who are showing important leadership on consumer rights. Our concerns include the business practices by companies such as Viagogo. Just last night I pressed it on its supply of tickets from the power sellers and the public selling tickets they cannot use. It said there was none. We are also concerned that the secondary market and its exorbitant prices are the only game in town thanks to mass ticket touting, and that there are links to organised crime as identified by police Operation Podium.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/12">Like my hon. Friend, I believe we can only address the industrial ripping off of consumers with regulation. To deal with the power sellers, resale prices should be capped at say 10% or 20% of face value. Although that needs further discussion, our overall objective must be fairness to fans.</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/13">Fans need to know that they can buy a ticket in confidence without being gouged financially. When it comes to nationally significant events such as the rugby world cup, fans also need to know that if they cannot attend the event, they can sell their ticket back to the organisers and recoup the cost. The Bill would not stifle the right of the genuine fan to buy and sell tickets for most events at a fair price when they can no longer attend. Instead, real fans would get back the first-come, first-served fairness of buying direct. They would be protected from</p>
	<p pid="a.782.2/14">internet chicanery, crowding them out and ripping them off. We need to end the market manipulation for sporting and cultural events in this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.784.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" speakername="Philip Davies" colnum="784"  time="014:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#140304-0002.htm_spnew43">
	<p pid="a.784.0/1">I rise to oppose the Bill not just because of the delusional prediction that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40094" name="Nick Smith">the hon. Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith)</phrase> made about the forthcoming match between England and Wales but because of the nature of the Bill itself. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman starts off by looking at the report, which was produced in the last Parliament, of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee of which I was, and happily remain, a member. It found that the secondary ticketing market was perfectly legitimate. Furthermore, the Office of Fair Trading also concluded that the secondary ticket market worked in the interest of the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/2">The hon. Gentleman might want to consider the evidence given to our Select Committee by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40055" name="Margaret Hodge">the right hon. Member for Barking (Margaret Hodge)</phrase> when she was a Member of the previous Labour Government. She gave a particularly robust defence of the secondary market and why Labour did not want to interfere in it. He would be wise to read her evidence because it was compelling.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/3">One misapprehension is that ticket touts and people in the secondary market are guaranteed to make a substantial profit, but that simply is not the case. For example, 50% of tickets sold on Viagogo are sold at face value or below and people can make a loss. As far as I am concerned, this is a matter of clear principle. If someone buys a ticket, that ticket belongs to them and they should be able to do what they please with it, just as they should with any other commodity that they buy. For argument&#8217;s sake, there are times on the high street when designer handbags come out in limited edition. Some 30 or 40 may be available. It is first come, first served. People rush into the shops to snatch one. They then immediately put them on eBay to make a massive profit. I do not see what the difference is between that and those people who want to sell on a ticket at an inflated price if they think that demand outstrips supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/4">That also happens with toys. One Christmas, Buzz Lightyear was an especially popular toy, so people bought the limited stock and immediately sold the toys on eBay at a huge profit. I do not understand why tickets should be treated differently, but perhaps the hon. Gentleman wants to restrict people&#8217;s ability to resell any commodity above the price that they paid for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/5">The hon. Gentleman fairly made the point&#8212;he then disagreed with it&#8212;that a promoter or organiser does not lose anything as a result of the secondary ticketing market. If a promoter puts on an event for which there are 50,000 tickets and charges &#163;20 for each, they have decided that they want to realise &#163;1 million from that event. After all the tickets have sold, that &#163;1 million has been made, so whatever happens subsequently makes no difference to the event&#8217;s viability or that promoter. The hon. Gentleman talks about people spending money on policing the secondary market, but I suggest that they do not bother, because they then do not waste money doing so and can realise the amount that they get in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/6">It is absolutely essential that there is a resale mechanism for tickets for the rugby world cup. The supporters of the some of the successful rugby teams, such as the All Blacks, are likely to buy many of the tickets for the final in the expectation that their team will reach it. That might well be the case, but the All Blacks could equally find themselves knocked out in the semi-final and if that happens, surely it would be in the best interests of the competition for there to be a mechanism through which New Zealand supporters may sell on their tickets to the supporters of the teams that reach the final. If those All Blacks supporters are not allowed to resell their tickets in the way that I would like, we will have the ridiculous situation that the crowd at the final is full of people who do not support either team, yet the people who want the tickets cannot buy them.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/7">The hon. Gentleman talked about real fans, but I am not sure what the definition of a &#8220;real fan&#8221; is. I suggest, Madam Deputy Speaker, that if someone is prepared to pay &#163;1,200, &#163;1,500 or &#163;2,000 for a ticket, you can bet your bottom dollar that they are a real fan. I do not understand the suggestion that selling tickets at inflated prices stops real fans attending events because if people are prepared to pay such prices, the chances are that they are especially keen fans. There is a simple premise that if someone does not want to pay the price that a seller asks, they should not do so. No one forces someone to pay an inflated price for a ticket&#8212;it is a free choice. If I decide at the last minute that I want to attend a sold-out event, the secondary market is the only place I can go to access a ticket. I am not sure why the hon. Gentleman wants to remove that choice from people. If I think that the price being asked is too high, I will just walk away and not attend, but at least I will have had a chance to go to that event, although I would have had no such opportunity without the secondary ticketing market.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/8">The hon. Gentleman should be aware that the promoters of many events such as concerts do not offer people a refund if they buy a ticket but then find that they cannot attend. What on earth are such people supposed to do except the perfectly legitimate thing of selling their ticket to someone else?</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/9">If event promoters and sports organisers&#8212;perhaps the organisers of the rugby world cup&#8212;are so concerned about ticket touts and the secondary ticketing market, why do they not do something about it themselves? If they are worried, why do they put all the tickets on sale right from the word go meaning that they sell out in 43.5 seconds, to use the Monty Python example that the hon. Gentleman cited? Why do not they sell a few tickets each week so that tickets are still available at face value in the week before the game or concert, meaning</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/10">that no one would have to pay inflated prices through secondary ticketing? If this is such a big issue for the organisers of events, sporting fixtures and concerts, they could do something about it at the drop of the hat. However, they do not anything about it, which can lead us to conclude only that they are shedding crocodile tears and are actually rather pleased that they can sell all their tickets in 43.5 seconds because that is good for their cash flow and guarantees a sell-out. I do not think that organisers are as bothered about the situation as the hon. Gentleman would have us believe.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/11">It is often said that public opinion favours restricting the secondary ticketing market, but let me share the results of ICM polling with the House. ICM asked people to agree or disagree with the statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/12">&#8220;If I had a ticket to a sporting event, concert or other event that I could no longer use, then I should be allowed to resell it&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/13">and 86% agreed. Some 83% of people agreed with the statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/14">&#8220;Once I&#8217;ve bought a ticket it is my property and I should be able to sell it just as I can any other private property.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/15">Despite such agreement with that premise, the hon. Gentleman argues against it.</p>
	<p pid="a.784.0/16">I am extremely proud of the fact that when I worked for Asda, before I entered the House, it challenged and overturned the net book agreement, under which publishers set a book&#8217;s price and no one could sell it at a different price without the publisher&#8217;s agreement. Overturning that agreement has driven down the price of books for consumers throughout the country, but the hon. Gentleman wants a system such as the net book agreement whereby event organisers sell tickets at a particular price and no one can sell them at a different price, which would represent a massive retrograde step for this country&#8217;s free market. The Office of Fair Trading concluded that such an system would not work in the best interests of the consumer, but the current arrangements do, as was endorsed by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee. I do not intend to press the motion to a Division, but I hope that the Minister has listened to my objections and that the Government will not go down the route that the hon. Gentleman encourages, which is a rabbit warren that it would be best to avoid.</p>

	<p pid="a.787.6/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point, but it rebounds slightly on the Defence Committee because we have been told that we are responsible for applying for such debates and, I have to confess, we have not done so in recent months, so perhaps we ought to revisit that.</p>
	<p pid="a.787.6/2">The Defence Committee launched an inquiry into defence and cyber-security in January 2012, as part of a series of debates and inquiries looking into emerging threats. It was the first time the Committee had investigated cyber-security as a discrete topic, although in 2009 we had looked at Georgia and Estonia, and visited Talinn, as part of another inquiry. The UK Government had identified cyber-threats as one of four tier 1 risks to national security, and in November 2013 published a UK cyber-security strategy, updating its 2009 strategy and setting out four objectives: first, to make the UK one of the most secure places in the world to do business in cyberspace; secondly, to make the UK more resilient to cyber-attack and better able to protect our interests in cyberspace; thirdly, to help to shape an open, vibrant and stable cyberspace that supports open societies; and fourthly, to build the UK&#8217;s cyber-security knowledge, skills and capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.787.6/3">The programme is to be implemented via a four-year national cyber-security programme costing &#163;650 million, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced an extra &#163;210 million investment after the 2013 spending review. The funding is shared between the security and intelligence agencies, the Ministry of Defence, the Home Office, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Cabinet Office and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, but most will be spent by the security and intelligence agencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.787.6/4">During our inquiry, the Committee investigated whether the high profile given to the cyber-threat in the UK was matched by a coherent plan and a chain of command in the event of a major cyber-attack on our national infrastructure or our national interests. The complexity of the threat must be matched by an agile, many-layered response; accordingly, many different agencies are involved in the cyber-security effort, ranging across cybercrime, cyber-espionage and cyber-commerce. Cyber-security is therefore to some extent everybody&#8217;s responsibility, but we must avoid its ending up being nobody&#8217;s responsibility as a consequence. Someone has to be in charge.</p>

I understood from reading his Committee&#8217;s report that the Joint Forces Commander is currently responsible, but the intention is to have the Chief of Defence Intelligence involved as well, and perhaps to appoint a three-star Defence Chief Information Officer. The report did not make it clear to me where we intend to go. The Americans have a four-star in charge. Is my right hon.

	<p pid="a.789.2/1">I have heard of that work at the University of Cambridge, too, and I am in favour of it, but may I take my right hon. Friend back to his point on co-ordination? Surely the bottom line of the response to any major threat to this country, whether it is flooding or rioting and so on, is the armed forces. Does he share my concern that there seems to be no mechanism for referring problems in other sectors through to the MOD and, crucially, that there are no rehearsals taking place?</p>

	<p pid="a.789.3/1">I do, and I hope that in answering the debate my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces will take that point straight on the chin, because in many respects the armed forces are the resource of last resort, and cyber-security may be an area where the armed forces do not accept that responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.789.3/2">There is a necessary focus within the defence world on securing the systems and networks needed by the MOD and the armed forces from cyber-threats. It is not only contemporary civil society that is utterly dependent on network technology; our armed forces are increasingly reliant on such technology for the tools of warfare, and the next step must be to ensure that the supply chain for those systems and their components is secure. That will require a trusting, transparent relationship between Government and their suppliers, with full disclosure of attacks and possible vulnerabilities, which runs all the way down the supply chain. The UK has world-class expertise and facilities on which to draw, but will the Government be able, in competition with the private sector, to keep enough of that expertise and experience in the service of the state? Are there enough such people to serve both and how should we prioritise?</p>
	<p pid="a.789.3/3">The announcement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence in September 2013 about the establishment of a joint cyber reserve unit is a significant development, but that will rely on FTSE companies and other, smaller companies releasing key personnel to participate. Will my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Armed Forces tell us what progress has been made? According to the Government, the number of ICT and cyber-security professionals in the UK has not increased in line with the growth of the internet. Are there enough experts in industry willing to join a cyber reserve? Will technology experts&#8212;the geeks of our world&#8212;fit well within highly regimented military structures, or will a more flexible structure be required to facilitate their work?</p>

	<p pid="a.790.0/1">Like my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40144" name="Julian Brazier">the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier)</phrase>, the hon. Gentleman contributes so effectively to the Defence Committee and makes an interesting point&#8212;one I had not heard before. That is the value of these debates. We will all have to think about that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.0/2">We must seek to defend ourselves, but we must also, as has been suggested, expect to develop a capability to respond to threats in cyberspace. When doing that, we face some of the same considerations as when developing conventional military capabilities. Where does the balance lie between international collaboration and sovereign capability, for example? What sort of international arrangements will best suit our aims?</p>
	<p pid="a.790.0/3">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State also talked about how the UK was developing a full spectrum military cyber-capability, including strike capability. This is an interesting and novel declaration. Everybody knows it has happened but nobody has been prepared before now to announce it. Will this declaration act as a deterrent or will it make the UK a more likely target for hacktivists and foreign states? What about the legal implications of establishing a strike capability for the personnel involved? The necessary rules for engagement for cyber-attack need to be put into place, although of course we will not be told about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.0/4">Some maintain that cyber is just another military domain and that we can expect to do everything in cyberspace that we do in the air, on land or at sea to prevent, deter coerce or intervene. But has the distinctiveness of the cyber domain been fully grasped? It is not clear, for example, that deterrence is a concept that can apply to a domain where there are real difficulties in discovering quickly who has perpetrated an attack and for what purpose, or even that an attack has taken place. Neither is it clear that everyone has grasped how important it is to avoid a silo approach to the cyberworld. It is essential to break down the dividing lines between civilian and military, among Government Departments, between Government and the private sector, and between our country and other countries, and therefore to approach the issue in an holistic way. Paul Dwyer of Mandiant came to brief the Defence Committee and told us that it takes a network to defeat a network.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.0/5">Perhaps because the threat cannot be neatly categorised, it may be unrealistic to expect a neat categorisation of the responses. Everything we have been told in the UK emphasises that the armed forces have a very limited role, protecting their own systems and developing military cyber-capabilities. For other areas of activity, those in the lead are likely to be based elsewhere, particularly in the intelligence services. That is where the important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury comes in.</p>

	<p pid="a.790.1/1">My right hon. Friend makes a good point about the threat being so diverse as to be difficult to counter. None the less, the briefing we were given by Mandiant was very interesting: there are a large number</p>
	<p pid="a.790.1/2">of extremely serious attacks, not by a lot of people but by one or two groups. He even named Unit 61398 of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army as one of the main culprits. In other words, it would be reasonably easy for the British Government and the MOD to counter a specific attack such as that.</p>

	<p pid="a.791.0/1">I am sure that my hon. Friend is right in saying that the Government are well aware of where some of these attacks are coming from. I do not agree that it would be relatively easy to counter them, because these threats are developing at a frightening speed, as the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness said. The diversity and development of these threats is changing on a second-by-second basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.791.0/2">I am pleased to say that the Government are taking action to make the UK more resilient to cyber-attacks. It has established a new computer emergency response team in early 2014, CERT-UK, to improve the co-ordination of national cyber-incidents and to share technical information among countries. The Government set up a new cyber-incident response scheme in GCHQ to help organisations recover from a cyber-security attack. They have extended the remit of the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure&#8212;the CPNI&#8212;to work with all organisations that may have a role in protecting the UK&#8217;s critical systems and intellectual property. They have agreed with regulators in essential services a set of actions to make sure that important data and systems in our critical national infrastructure continue to be safe and resilient. As I have said, responsibility for cyber-security rests principally with companies and organisations themselves. Government agencies&#8217; roles will be limited by available resources and national priorities.</p>

His regret was that it had not been one of greater growth, and that that change had not been more exaggerated than it was.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.2/2">I ought to bring my remarks to a close, as others want to speak. Paul Dwyer told the Committee that the willingness of companies to share information about cyber attacks with one another and with the Government is critical to allowing an effective response to be developed and implemented but, while critical, it is far from easy to achieve.</p>

He said that the Committee visited Estonia.

	<p pid="a.792.4/1">The Committee visited Estonia in 2009. It has still not been conclusively established who precisely was responsible for the attacks that took down much of that country&#8217;s banking system, although we have our suspicions&#8212;they may have been marching around in unmarked uniforms. We discovered that the attack had been comparatively easy to achieve. It was a distributed denial-of-service attack that did real damage. We also discovered the international centre of excellence in Estonia, which at that stage the Government were not contributing towards in dealing with cyber-attacks. I am delighted that they have since decided, perhaps as a result of our incredibly effective report, to contribute to the centre.</p>

	<p pid="a.792.6/1">If there is evidence of that, I do not yet know of it. All I can say is that before the invasion of Georgia there was an extensive cyber-attack on its computer network that was very similar to the one on Estonia. I suspect that it is now a new method of fighting wars that we must all get used to.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.6/2">The need to share information is critical, as I have said, and important mechanisms for that exist, such as the cyber-security information sharing partnership, which is now open to companies beyond critical national infrastructure sectors, including small and medium-sized businesses. CISP analysts will be are expected to feed into CERT once it is fully operational.</p>
	<p pid="a.792.6/3">The Committee produced many recommendations, but our final conclusion was that the cyber-threat, like other emerging threats, has the capacity to evolve with almost unimaginable speed and with serious consequences for the nation&#8217;s security. The Government need to put in place&#8212;they have not yet done so&#8212;mechanisms, people, education, skills, thinking and policies that take into account both the opportunities and the vulnerabilities that cyber presents. It is time the Government approached the subject with vigour. I am pleased to see the actions that they have taken since we issued our report. Clearly there is much more to be done&#8212;in the cyber world it is a matter of constantly playing catch-up&#8212;but I personally have the impression that the Government are, at the very least, joining in the game.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.793.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40392" speakername="Dai Havard" colnum="793"  time="014:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#140304-0002.htm_spnew71">
	<p pid="a.793.2/1">I would first like to say something about the debate. I agree that the Defence Committee is perhaps remiss in not applying for debates more regularly. This debate is taking place on an estimates day. It is a really serious debate that should be taking place in the Chamber in its own right. Our report is now more than 12 months old&#8212;it was published in January 2013&#8212;which says something about how quickly these things move. The Government published their response in March 2013 and then made a series of announcements last September, but here we are today with the first opportunity to talk about it. That is an issue we need to look at.</p>
	<p pid="a.793.2/2">I will not repeat what my colleague who chairs the Defence Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the right hon. Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase>, said about structure, but I would like to say something about structure, about investment&#8212;we are talking about money, after all&#8212;and about accountability. The statement made in September was very interesting from two points of view. First, it set out a structure for how the Ministry of Defence, along with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, the Cabinet Office and others&#8212;this cannot be done in isolation&#8212;can start to look at its relationship with industry and at protecting itself through its relationships with the rest of the British community. I think that is hugely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.793.2/3">There is a lot of work being done on achieving proper standards. We took evidence from industry representatives on that, and they were all over the shop, frankly. For example, they did not want standards, or they wanted</p>
	<p pid="a.793.2/4">their own standards. The question of standards is absolutely at the guts of the whole issue of defining cyber, and not just for the Ministry of Defence. Industry must now have a compliance process with the Ministry of Defence, and I am sure that the Minister will say something about how that is to be done. That is hugely welcome, because it is vital. How we then do that in relation to our allies, NATO, the EU, the French&#8212;with our treaty&#8212;and others is a big issue that needs proper discussion. We need to have proper compliance and assurance mechanisms, as we do with our &#8220;Five Eyes&#8221; colleagues and many others, because we are all trying to understand the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.793.2/5">Most people go to Wikipedia when they do not know much about something, as I did with cyber-warfare, because the announcement in September also mentioned having some sort of offensive capability. Wikipedia states:</p>
	<p pid="a.793.2/6">&#8220;Not to be confused with Electronic warfare&#8230; Cyberwarfare refers to politically motivated hacking to conduct sabotage and espionage. It is a form of information warfare sometimes seen as analogous to conventional warfare.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.793.2/7">Well, that is terribly helpful. What we know is that there is no clear definition, either domestically or internationally. We are all fishing for something to help us understand this properly, and we should have some humility in that. However, we recognise its interconnectivity.</p>
	<p pid="a.793.2/8">Let me turn to the statement on having offensive capability. It was very brave of the UK Government to make that statement. We are the first country to come out and say that. I have spoken with some of our international allies about that, and they say, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s a very interesting statement for the Brits to make.&#8221; How we actually do that will be a matter for discussion. I am not necessarily against the investment or the capability, but I think that we need to be very clear about what we are saying and how we are going to do things. There will need to be a doctrine and rules of engagement. If we are saying that this is a new domain, I do not think that we can run away from some of these questions. If we do and we keep it too secret, we will lose legitimacy for the activities that we wish to undertake. That is a difficult balancing act, but it is absolutely crucial.</p>
	<p pid="a.793.2/9">If we are to weaponise the process, how will we do that? There is a lot of talk about countries using the Stuxnet virus in Iran. That was actually delivered physically on a memory stick. The programme then searched out the thing it wanted to destroy or debilitate. It was a hugely expensive exercise. I do not know how much it cost, because I am not supposed to know who did it. Well, we do not know who did it, or we all suspect that we know. Whoever did it, it was not a bunch of amateurs; it was someone who could put substantial investment into it. It turned out to be a one-shot weapon.</p>
	<p pid="a.793.2/10">If we are to weaponise this area, we must be clear that it will cost money. This sort of activity cannot be done by a boy working in his bedroom to come up with a fancy programme. We will have to invest in the process of weaponisation alongside all the other things we are talking about. How will we procure, what will we do with regard to research and technology, and how will we keep a sovereign capability in these areas? I suspect that those are big questions that Parliament will be discussing for many years to come.</p>

	<p pid="a.795.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making an interesting speech. Does he agree that the issue is about not only the technical side but the personal side? More medieval fortresses fell through the inside touch than through outside assault. In the high-tech area, as in everywhere else, people can be bought or suborned.</p>

	<p pid="a.795.1/1">The short answer is yes. The other aspect is who can be engaged to help to do such things. As the hon. Gentleman, who is on the Defence Committee, will know, the structuring of things to ensure a reserve capability is hugely important. The way in which the process is being put together is correct; there will be no monopoly on understanding in the areas we are discussing. We need as good a collaboration as possible. The delivery of the processes will not always be remote. Intelligence and knowing what is happening, where and with whom will be crucial. I shall come to that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.795.1/2">The other question that comes up is about the law&#8212;I mentioned legitimacy earlier. I am helping to lead a sub-study in the Defence Committee of the military and the law. That is coloured, obviously, by Supreme Court decisions, individual cases and all the rest of it. The issue raises questions about international law, humanitarian law, extra-territorial jurisdiction and other things. An argument is being put that says, &#8220;We don&#8217;t need anything to be separate. This is a different domain, but all the current legal constructs are good enough and we do not need anything different.&#8221; I come back to my earlier point. We need to be clear about doctrine. In large part, our doctrine is public. Some, however, may not be as public as we would like, but we need to be clear about how we do things.</p>

	<p pid="a.795.2/1">We seem to accept that cyber can be not just defensive, but offensive&#8212;we can use it offensively. Does my hon. Friend think that our domestic legal structure is sufficient to deal with cyber as an offensive weapon and to contain the power of the Executive to apply that weapon?</p>

	<p pid="a.795.3/1">I do not know, but in the sense that I think I do know, I think that our legal structure is not sufficient and needs revision. I might be wrong, but that debate has to take place and people more qualified than I am need to comment.</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/2">It is interesting to note where our allies are. The United States has and has not made all sorts of declarations. If we believe <i>The New York Times</i>, there was a secret legal review that concluded that</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/3">&#8220;US military forces could legally launch an attack on digital infrastructure located in a foreign country if it found evidence of a threat against its own systems&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/4">A rules of engagement debate then starts. That is the other difficult bit&#8212;we will have to have rules of engagement for such activity. The more we discuss legitimacy in law for these things, the better. If we do not have such a discussion, the issue will be forced on us. That is what we are seeing now in a lot of other areas, so we should structure how we wish to have the debate rather than having a structure imposed on us.</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/5">Proportionality is at the guts of the whole business of international law, human rights and legitimacy. We have to show that proportionality is there and that we have mechanisms and systems to ensure that it is. Simply claiming that it is there will not be good enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/6">We are not on our own. We need to be joined up not only internally within the United Kingdom, but internationally. We do not have time to go fully into this now, but it is interesting to see Russia&#8217;s current adventures in Ukraine. In September 2011, Russia and China said to a UN group that they wanted a code of conduct for cyberspace that would include requirements for co-operation in:</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/7">&#8220;curbing dissemination of information which incites terrorism, secessionism, extremism or undermines other countries&#8217; political, economic and social stability, as well as their spiritual and cultural environment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/8">Well, there we are&#8212;now we know. Translating that into current events will tell us a lot. That proposed code of conduct was about closing things down and giving legitimacy to the avoidance of dissent and to having systems that are less rather than more open. How we collaborate in this area will be important.</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/9">When he was Secretary of Defence in America, Bob Gates said that he could protect .mil, .gov, .org or .com, but that as the protection systems were put in, the public might not like what they saw on .com. That debate is not only to do with defence, but defence has a place in it. Whether there should be a code of conduct and the international arrangements are problematic issues, but there is a growing urgency around them.</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/10">At the end of the day, the issue can be about the collection of raw information and the sending of viruses to blow particular equipment up. That is the geeky stuff&#8212;the weaponisation and the sexy stuff that the press love. However, at the end of the day, those and other actions are only as good as the intelligence that exists to put them into effect. One area of investment that must not be lost in the question of cyber-issues is defence intelligence. In my opinion, we have the best intelligence analysts and they need to be developed.</p>
	<p pid="a.795.3/11">We can collect the raw information, but if we do not understand it we will go nowhere with it and make the wrong decision. Investment discussions should please not just be about technical toys, GCHQ and all the stuff about weapons; they should also be about intelligence analysts. Let us protect the capability. The issue is about a whole force, but also about a whole community. Those people are vital in that community and investment also needs to go to them.</p>

	<p pid="a.796.0/1">I welcome the chance to debate the UK&#8217;s cyber-security defence. Cyber-security is a particularly wide-ranging subject and cyber-attacks are a growing threat. Without stating the obvious, a cyber-attack could impact on everyone&#8217;s lives in so many ways. We are now all so reliant on technology and the internet; without our mobile phones or when our e-mail goes down, we almost cease to function.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/2">A major cyber-attack on any of this country&#8217;s main utilities, such as transport, energy or the banking system, would cause chaos. It would be, at the very least, very bad for the economy; it could, in the worst-case scenario&#8212;if we did not have the means to transport food and fuel, for example&#8212;cause social breakdown in a short time. South Korea, for instance, has suffered huge jamming attacks, launched by North Korea, against its GPS systems. They affected major airports and shipping</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/3">lanes. The travel of more than 1,000 ships and 250 planes was disrupted by North Korean jamming attacks in 2012.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/4">Cyber-security needs to protect us against so many threats: criminals attacking personal data, small-scale political activists&#8212;or &#8220;hacktivists&#8221;, as somebody said earlier&#8212;and state-sponsored hostilities. The Government&#8217;s cyber-security strategy is along the right lines and has led to the national cyber-security programme, which has clear objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/5">Cyberspace is often compared to the wild west and thought by some to be beyond the rule of law. However, our Government have made it clear that it is not and they have encouraged law enforcement teams to use the existing legal framework to prosecute. When cyber-crime emanates from overseas, the Government are working with the G8, the United Nations, NATO and the European Union to help shape the standards and norms of behaviour for cyberspace. Obviously, the solutions have not all yet been found but the discussions are ongoing and the work is slowly evolving. I am pleased that the work has started in earnest.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/6">Part of the solution is normal, sensible protocol for cyber-security on the domestic agenda and it can be addressed through simple best practice. There is a knowledge gap and the Government are addressing it in the long term via the development of education in cyber-security; teaching materials on cyber-security are being produced for GCSE and A-level students. Academic centres for cyber-security have been set up in 11 universities. Investment in education is far-sighted and will position the UK with experts in the cyber-security arena.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/7">The Government have also gone some way to engaging with industry by setting up the Cyber-Security Information Sharing Partnership. Furthermore, the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, or CPNI, is working with businesses to encourage them to make cyber-security a board-level responsibility. The current work on the development of an official cyber-standard will help stimulate the adoption of good cyber-practices among businesses. Given the risks to our infrastructure as a whole, the Government have highlighted the role of regulators in overseeing the adoption of robust cyber-security measures. The companies that supply essential services such as power, telecommunications, water, transport and banking, need maximum protection.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/8">I praise the many organisations that are tasked with upholding the Government&#8217;s cyber-defence plans. However, as has been said, the threat is so great that I worry that as a nation we are not doing enough, fast enough. An industry study produced by BT last month found that British companies are lagging way behind rivals in other major countries in addressing cyber-security risks. The survey found that only 17% of UK businesses see cyber-security as a priority compared with 41% in the US. Nearly 90% of directors and decision makers in the US are given IT security training, but in the UK it is only around 37%.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/9">On defence, our armed forces are among the most technologically advanced in the world, and I am sure we are all proud of that. In theory, that allows us to put fewer of our people in harm&#8217;s way and their lives at risk. However, as the Under-Secretary of State for Defence, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40378" name="Philip Dunne">the hon. Member for Ludlow (Mr Dunne)</phrase> said recently, it makes every aspect of our military capability vulnerable</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/10">to cyber-attack. Obviously, there is no point spending millions in developing leading-edge technology without the cyber-security to stop it being felled by a single cyber-attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/11">The Defence Committee noted that the Army has between 35% and 40% too few corporals and sergeants to man its cyber-capabilities. The Government have rightly set up a joint cyber-unit for the reserve forces, which was going well towards the end of the year, and others have said that the reserve forces will play a crucial role in our future capability. The Government have instigated broadly sensible long-term solutions such as apprenticeships to fill the staff-skills gap in industry and business, but how can we attract more trained staff immediately, especially in the defence reserve?</p>
	<p pid="a.796.0/12">A further concern is that the threat is so wide and imminent that the command structure is not resilient. I understand that the global operations security control centre at Corsham has been empowered to take rapid action without direction from above to defend the MOD&#8217;s own networks from attack. That is great, but with the many groups set up to implement the UK cyber-strategy, how will one section know what the others are doing when an attack has happened?</p>

The GOSCC is in my constituency, and does an outstanding job in providing cyber-security for the MOD.

	<p pid="a.798.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention. He is absolutely right. Within the chaos of a potential attack, I am not sure how the disparate groups would communicate with one another, how there would be a uniform chain of command and how it would work in practice. GCHQ seems to be in charge, but in other countries the matter would fall under the Ministry of Defence. It is fine that the MOD seems to be still developing its own basic cyber-security techniques with the armed forces setting up separate units, but it is the responsibly of the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure to take the lead in co-ordinating a UK response to a major cyber-security incident.</p>
	<p pid="a.798.1/2">An extremely clear command structure will be needed to deal with a cyber-attack, which may come from a political group such as the group that claimed that the Sochi games were being held on the graves of millions of people who had been murdered and who were, according to the US Government&#8217;s computer emergency readiness team, threatening companies financing or supporting the Sochi winter games with cyber-attacks.</p>
	<p pid="a.798.1/3">The response would be different if an attack was state-sponsored, but it would be extremely difficult, especially in the first day or so, to determine where the threat came from and whether it came from an individual or a country. The internet is worldwide and even if we knew where the attack came from geographically, it would be difficult to identify who was behind it.</p>

	<p pid="a.798.2/1">I am pleased to be able to give my hon. and gallant Friend a pause to think what he is going to say next. When Mandiant briefed us last week, we were told by Paul Dwyer that 66% of our</p>
	<p pid="a.798.2/2">companies take about 243 days to realise that they are subject to what he called an advanced persistent threat, and that some companies have no idea that they are being attacked and will never find out.</p>

	<p pid="a.799.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his helpfully timed intervention. He is absolutely right. Sometimes it is difficult or impossible to determine that an attack has taken place.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.0/2">On offensive cyber-capability and action, a recent article published by the Royal United Services Institute said that Stuxnet, the malware supposedly used to attack Iran&#8217;s nuclear weapons capability, was not successful in delaying Iran&#8217;s technical progress. With hindsight, some have seen Stuxnet as a hindrance to diplomatic solutions. I am not sure I entirely agree with that analysis, but it is interesting. Cyber-space is being described as the fifth domain of warfare, so its defence and protection from attack is integral to the operation of our nation&#8217;s defence infrastructure.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.0/3">My last point is whether we are spending enough, which is not an easy subject in a time of fiscal austerity. Last week, Chuck Hagel, the US Secretary of Defence, outlined a vision for a leaner US defence posture with reductions in the US army to a pre-1942 position. However, at the same time, he rightly proposed increased spending on cyber-defence.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.799.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" speakername="Madeleine Moon" colnum="799"  time="015:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#140304-0002.htm_spnew84">
	<p pid="a.799.4/1">I apologise, Madam Deputy Speaker, for not standing up. I thought <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40260" name="Jack Lopresti">the hon. Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Jack Lopresti)</phrase> had sat down to take an intervention, but slowly it came to my mind that he had finished his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.4/2">It is an honour to follow the hon. and gallant Gentleman. I share his concern about an attack on our national infrastructure, but we sometimes focus on things such as banking and transport when we should perhaps look at our food supplies or our hospitals. The impact of such an attack on the civilian population and the country&#8217;s morale would be huge. We must address resilience to a cyber-attack and we must engage the civilian population in understanding and preparing for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.4/3">T he Chairman of the Defence Committee and I were given a book for holiday reading: &#8220;One Second After&#8221;. That delightful read, which probably wrecked my summer,</p>
	<p pid="a.799.4/4">was a description of the United States after an electro-magnetic impulse attack had taken out all its computer-based systems. Everything went. No cars could go on the road and nothing would work. It was a scary prospect and I now understand why the Defence Committee&#8217;s Chairman runs a car that does not have a computer in it. I am sure the book was a great influence in the decision to purchase that car.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.4/5">The book also made me aware of the very narrow issue of who is the enemy. In traditional warfare, we tend to know who we are fighting, but in future we may be fighting criminals who are holding the country to ransom. We could be fighting terrorists, because a state is not needed to manufacture a cyber-attack, or activists or anarchists. It has been suggested that some of the attacks in Estonia were by third-party actors. At the bottom of the list is the potential for a state to attack, because states like rules and the rest do not follow rules. That is why they must be our focus, our worry and our concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.4/6">A statement made in 2012 informed us:</p>
	<p pid="a.799.4/7">&#8220;Our cyber defences blocked around 400,000 advanced, malicious cyber threats against the government&#8217;s secure intranet alone&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.799.4/8">On the whole, we do not know where those threats are coming from. We do know that the Government have given a commitment to having full-spectrum capability in dealing with cyber-attacks. In fact, in response to the growing number of cyber-attacks, the Secretary of State said that</p>
	<p pid="a.799.4/9">&#8220;we are developing a full-spectrum military cyber capability, including a strike capability, to enhance the UK&#8217;s range of military capability. Increasingly, our defence budget is being invested in high-end capabilities such as cyber and intelligence and surveillance assets to ensure we can keep the country safe.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.799.4/10">I was very interested in that statement, so it sent me off on a little tangent, as such things often do. As the Minister, who has received many of my quirky little requests for information, will know, I sent off a parliamentary question to every Department asking them how many specialist IT staff they employed who had a PhD in computer science, who had a master&#8217;s degree in computer science, and perhaps who even had just a basic bachelor&#8217;s degree in computer science. It did not bode well, I have to say. The Ministry of Defence can rest on its laurels; it came second to the Department for Work and Pensions, with 1,625 such members of staff. None of the Departments could break the information down by qualification across Departments, which could explain why Government are not very good at commissioning cyber-capability and improved computer networking capability. Only 5,088 people, in total, held a degree-level capability in computing. It was depressing to note that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport had only three people with such a qualification, so we should watch out for its contracting.</p>

	<p pid="a.800.0/1">Given the logic of Government, did my hon. Friend also ask whether the people with a computing degree actually worked in such areas beforehand or did something completely different?</p>

	<p pid="a.800.1/1">I did, and most Departments responded that they worked in specialist teams, as we would expect.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/2">Interestingly, the response from Her Majesty&#8217;s Treasury told us that a total of 48 people are employed within its centralised IT department, or teams. Those staff provide</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/3">IT services to the Cabinet Office and to the Treasury. That compares with 57 people in 2008 who worked exclusively within the Treasury. So the numbers are going down, and that has to be a matter of concern. As people with these skills are increasingly highly valued in the marketplace, can Government stay ahead of the market in being able to recruit them?</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/4">I was worried about the budget and looked into that aspect. We have heard about the figure of &#163;650 million over five years, which is a mere fraction of the figure for the annual economy, which is set to lose &#163;27 billion every year to criminal activity in the cyber-realm. In contrast, the US Department of Defence has outlined a $23 billion spend on cyber operations in the financial year of 2018 alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/5">I thought that I would then have a look at how well we were doing in this area. I discovered, rather alarmingly, that the Government had withdrawn from a new cyber-warfare project called Project Cipher, which was intended to scrutinise fully complex programmes to ensure that they had the potential to meet our needs. After thorough assessment, it was decided that Cipher would not meet the full defence capability required to offer long-term value for the taxpayer, and so the programme was not taken forward. The costs of the stalled project, in the assessment phase alone, had been &#163;66 million, so we have lost a large percentage of the money set aside for cyber, and they were &#163;47 million above the original budget. Overall, this was a major disaster. IHS Janes has said that the project was</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/6">&#8220;intended to renew the MoD&#8217;s cryptographic inventory and automate its crypto-key management systems by replacing obsolete current systems to prevent encoded communication links being compromised.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/7">I understood half that sentence. The important bit is that it was intended to replace obsolete current systems, because Departments are not good at replacing obsolescent systems. They tend to work things for the length of a Parliament, which is now five years when we all know that these computers are dying on their feet after about the first two years.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/8">IHS Janes continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/9">&#8220;The delays in bringing Cipher online are creating capability risks, says the NAO, because the ministry&#8217;s existing crypto capability lacks the flexibility to deliver the flagship Network Enabled Capability project, which aims to link up a wide range of military communication networks. This means efficiency savings relating to the automation of crypto capability has been delayed, leading to increased demands on military manpower.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/10">It explained that the problems with Cipher&#8217;s design first emerged during an assessment phase and that they were the result of the lack of suitably qualified experienced civil servants&#8212;you will be surprised to hear that, Madam Deputy Speaker. One of the essential things that we must do if we are to be responsible in looking to the defence of this country is to find the way to employ and retain the capability that we need within government to provide the skills and oversee the systems that we operate to keep this country secure.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/11">There has been considerable discussion about having a cyber reserve. I have had conversations with a number of companies that have told me that they are very worried about their employees joining the reserves because they fear for them when they have to travel abroad. Many international companies work around the globe, and they worry about someone who has been in our cyber reserve and transfers to work in another country,</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/12">or merely travels through a country perhaps on business or on holiday, being prone to personal attack because of the information they would hold not only on their company but on the UK&#8217;s cyber-defence capability. I hope the Minister is aware of that concern and will address it.</p>
	<p pid="a.800.1/13">This is perhaps one of the most urgent and pressing issues affecting this country. We have to take it seriously across every Government Department, but we also have to alert our citizens of the fact that they are also now on the front line, because the attack may come from their personal computer, which could be hacked and used for an attack not only on this Government, but on other Governments.</p>

	<p pid="a.802.2/1">I will do my best, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.802.2/2">I agree with the conclusion of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" name="Madeleine Moon">the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon)</phrase>: this is an extremely important issue and addressing cyber-security rightly sits at the top of our national security agenda. Cybercrime and cyber-attacks are not only tomorrow&#8217;s dangers; they are a very real and growing threat today. As others have already made clear, Governments, business and members of the public come under sustained attack from cyber-criminals and foreign powers. There were an estimated 44 million incidents in 2011 alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.802.2/3">As we become ever more reliant on the internet, our vulnerability increases. Cyber-threats take two primary forms&#8212;cybercrime and cyber-attack, although sometimes the distinction is blurred. Cybercrime was estimated by the Association of Chief Police Officers to have cost &#163;57 billion globally back in 2009, while Detica estimated that the 2011 figure for the United Kingdom alone was &#163;27 billion. It is difficult to believe that that there has not been a geometric increase since then.</p>
	<p pid="a.802.2/4">Large-scale cybercrime is an issue of national security. Cyber-attack and cyber-espionage also present a serious threat both to the state and to the community, and the state should be acting to protect both. As we know, cyber-attacks have had real-world effects, as exampled by the denial-of-service attacks in Estonia in 2007 and the Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear development capability, although there appear to be disagreements about the degree of its effectiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.802.2/5">Cyber-espionage and theft of sensitive information is another major concern, so addressing the danger of cyber-threats today is real, not academic. The Security Service estimates that at least 20 foreign intelligence agencies currently operate to some degree against British interests. That threat merits our immediate and strong attention, which is why I welcome this debate and the attention the Defence Committee has given to the subject.</p>

	<p pid="a.803.0/1">Given the amount of time I have left, I hope my hon. Friend will forgive me if I do not give way to him. If I have time at the end, I will come back to him.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/2">What is being done and developed in the strategy? In 2009, the previous Government produced Britain&#8217;s first cyber-security strategy, which, though laudable for initiating a centralised approach to cyber-security, I as the then shadow Minister critiqued as being a shallow copy of the then American strategy. I said:</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/3">&#8220;Minimal or no attention is given to key areas such as co-ordination of the new cyber-structures with existing agencies, response to a cyber incident and information sharing between government, industry&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/4">and international action. I also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/5">&#8220;There is no consideration within the strategy of how we would respond to a cyber-attack. No mention can be found of a framework for response or who would lead it. There is no discussion of issues such as back-up communications networks for security and emergency personnel.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/6">All of those were given coverage in the United States review at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/7">Given the severity of the threat, the then Opposition felt that the strategy was an inadequate response, so before the general election we produced our own paper on cyber-security and keeping Britain safe in the digital age. I am pleased to say that much of it found itself in the Government&#8217;s 2011 cyber-security strategy, which is currently being co-ordinated by the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.0/8">The strategy is far more detailed than its predecessor and offers a more thorough, co-ordinated and ambitious programme to enhance our cyber-security. The recent progress report from the Cabinet Office highlights the successes in implementing the strategy and the progress made towards achieving its objectives by 2015. I commend the strategy for its scope and ambition, incorporating everything from changes to law enforcement to greater co-operation and information-sharing with the private sector and enhancing our cyber-resilience. That the strategy also balances the attainment of security with civil liberties is reassuring.</p>

	<p pid="a.803.1/1">Everything my hon. Friend says is absolutely right. The Ministry of Defence, of course, has no responsibility whatsoever for this. Is my hon. Friend therefore proposing that the things he is describing perfectly adequately should now become part of a defence cyber-strategy, or is he talking about something other than the topic of this debate?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.803.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40496" speakername="Crispin Blunt" colnum="803"  time="015:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#140304-0002.htm_spnew93">
	<p pid="a.803.2/1">My hon. Friend, in his usual perspicacious way, has identified precisely what I am moving on to, but before I finish on the wider cyber-security issue, I want to recognise the contribution made by the noble Lady, Baroness Neville-Jones in pulling this strategy together and much improving our country&#8217;s response.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/2">No strategy, however, is incapable of improvement and the Government still appear to preside over a patchwork muddle of agencies and mandates responsible for cyber-security. In 2011, the Intelligence and Security Committee identified 18 different actors with responsibilities for cyber-security, which raises concerns about duplication, cost-effectiveness and confusion. I note the counterpoint expressed by the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General, who said in evidence to the Defence</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/3">Committee that although the arrangement is untidy, it is effective, given the need for a cross-Government approach. I must say that, in the absence of a personality as strong as Baroness Neville-Jones, there remain issues about co-ordination and leadership, as was also mentioned by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40260" name="Jack Lopresti">the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Jack Lopresti)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/4">We must recognise that the updated cyber-security strategy is a major step forward, but, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40455" name="James Gray">the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray)</phrase> has made clear, defence is only one small component of the pan-Government effort and by no means the most important. I wonder whether the bracketing of cyber-security and defence is in fact wise, given the MOD&#8217;s relatively limited role. The MOD has only two formal responsibilities: to ensure that armed forces operability is maintained both at home and abroad by securing its networks, and to enhance military operations by developing future cyber-capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/5">Cyber-capability is immensely important for the armed forces: it is a battle-winning asset. In the same way that military operations become difficult if not impossible without air supremacy, cyber-superiority if not cyber-supremacy is required. What differentiates cyber-security is that it also applies to nearly every aspect of modem civil life. Not many businesses need to worry about the effectiveness of the F-35 and the Eurofighter in their daily operations, but the defensive cyber-capability is a daily national necessity for our financial system. Defence against most high-end cyber-threats, including those to critical national infrastructure, is the responsibility of other Departments, not least GCHQ and the Centre for Protection of National Infrastructure. Given that fact, the conflation of cyber-security with defence is possibly misleading, in that it obscures a complex and much bigger picture. However, we are debating cyber-security in the context of defence, so I shall focus on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/6">Other hon. Members have outlined the threat, so I simply want to say that the armed forces are increasingly vulnerable to highly targeted forms of cyber-attack, given the networked nature of modern military systems and the increased use of unmanned aerial vehicles and robots on the battlefield. Adversaries may seek signals interception to distort intelligence, disrupt logistical supply chains or, most worryingly, render major platforms and systems, such as ships and aircraft, dysfunctional. If we now regard cyber as a fifth domain of warfare, we must expect other countries to do so too. Britain is a world leader in defence technology, but we must expect emerging powers to be keen to shrink the development gap by stealing what they cannot easily or quickly develop for themselves. The need to protect the operability of our armed forces and the integrity of our defence establishment is thus abundantly clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/7">Of the &#163;650 million set aside to transform Britain&#8217;s national cyber-security capabilities over the next four years, the MOD will receive &#163;90 million. That funding is not intended to secure MOD networks, because that is assumed to be business as usual, but I know that the Department is securing its supply chain against cyber-attack. The point has already been made about the importance of the need for a resilient industrial base, which must form part of the goal of the national cyber-security strategy. The MOD has responsibility to help to manage the security of its suppliers, and I note the work that has been done to that effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/8">I also note the emphasis on reserve forces, which other hon. Members have mentioned, and I welcome the establishment of a joint cyber reserve unit. That is exactly the sort of imaginative use of civilian-qualified reservists in the armed forces that we will want in times of need, but we must bear it in mind that if the armed forces need them at a time of crisis, so will their host employers. On a separate point, I am encouraged by the assurance that spending on cyber will automatically be increased in the budgets of future programmes.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/9">Cyber is part of how our armed forces will wage war in future, so the Department must be able to continue to enhance its military cyber-capabilities. I therefore want to touch briefly on cyber-attack. Inevitably, developments in technology will always be highly classified because the possessor of the latest technological advance is likely to have a battle-winning capability. I therefore understand why information in this area is restricted. However, I emphasise to the Minister that the military should understand that this House expects them to possess cyber-attack capability alongside the ability to defend their own networks from cyber-attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/10">This area is highly sensitive because such technology can be applied against other states&#8217; non-military assets in a way that makes it difficult to be clear about whether the laws of war apply. I will finish by discussing this international aspect. This area sits in the grey area between espionage and conflict. That is why, in 2009, I called for us to co-operate internationally on cyber issues to regulate the relations between states in respect of cyber-conflict. I am delighted that that is recognised in the 2013 statement on aspects of state behaviour in cyberspace. We must try to identify the future international rules of the road that will govern relations between states in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/11">I will end by reiterating three questions. First, by bracketing cyber-security with defence, are we in danger of misleading ourselves about where the main effort needs to be? Secondly, can the lead responsibility for cyber-security be made clearer? Thirdly, are we affording enough resources to research and development in this vital area?</p>

	<p pid="a.805.2/1">The growth of the internet has, without question, transformed our everyday lives. I say that as someone who spent many years working for a multinational corporation that introduced every home to the personal computer and introduced the business world to the speed of the e-mail. The importance of the internet is underlined by the part that it plays in our economy. The internet-related market in the UK is estimated to be worth &#163;82 billion a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/2">However, with greater openness, interconnection and dependence on technology comes greater vulnerability. To put that in perspective, cyber-attacks have been categorised as a tier 1 threat to the UK&#8217;s national security, which puts them up there with international terrorism, military crises and natural disasters. The threats to our national security from cyber-attacks are therefore real and growing.</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/3">Terrorists, rogue states and cyber-criminals are among those who are targeting computer systems in the UK. That is highlighted by the fact that 93% of large corporations and 87% of small businesses have reported a cyber-breach in the past year. Performing an attack need not be expensive. With minimal equipment in the right hands, a lot of damage can be done. However, protection against such attacks does not come cheap. The cost of a cyber-security breach can be between &#163;450,000 and &#163;850,000 for a large business and between &#163;35,000 and &#163;65,000 for small and medium-sized businesses, which are not insignificant sums. The UK faces a staggering 1,000 cyber-attacks every hour, at an estimated annual cost of &#163;27 billion.</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/4">In cyberspace, power can be exerted by states, non-state organisations or individuals, or by proxy. The boundaries are blurred between the military and the civilian, and between the physical and the virtual. The threats to security and information in the cyber-domain include state-sponsored attacks, ideological and political extremism, serious organised crime, low-level individual crime, cyber-protests, espionage and cyber-terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/5">Some of the most sophisticated threats to the UK in cyberspace come from other states that seek to conduct espionage, and some states regard cyberspace as a way to commit hostile acts &#8220;deniably&#8221;. That is why, alongside our existing defence and security capabilities, the UK must be capable of protecting our national interests in cyberspace.</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/6">&#8220;Advanced persistent threat&#8221; is the term used most often to describe threats that are unlikely to be deterred by simple cyber-hygiene measures. Acts of aggression or malice in cyberspace differ from those in other domains. Cyberspace is regarded as an asymmetric domain, which means that even adversaries of limited means can pose a significant threat to military capabilities. We will all agree that cyberspace is a complex and rapidly changing environment.</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/7">The British Security Service estimates that at least 20 foreign intelligence services are operating to some degree against UK interests in cyberspace, and their targets are in the Government as well as in industry. The Government have pledged &#163;650 million for cyber-security over four years&#8212;0.6% of the cost of attacks. It is therefore essential that the MOD works alongside other Departments and the Security Service to ensure that there is no duplication or inefficiency, given budget constraints. We believe that the Government must ensure that every company working with the MOD, regardless of its size or the scale of its work, signs up to a cyber-security charter. That will ensure that hackers cannot use small suppliers to get into the systems of major defence companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/8">With the armed forces now so dependent on information and communications technology, should such systems suffer sustained cyber-attack, their ability to operate could be fatally compromised. Because events in cyberspace happen at great speed, there will not be time in the midst of a major international incident to develop doctrine, rules of engagement, or internationally accepted norms</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/9">of behaviour. That is why the Defence Committee recommended that the MOD make the development of rules of engagement for cyber-operations an urgent priority, and ensure that the necessary intelligence, planning and co-ordination functions are properly resourced.</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/10">The rapidly changing nature of the cyber-threat demands that a premium be placed on research and development to enable the MOD to keep pace with, understand, and anticipate that threat. The Government should make it a priority to develop robust protocols for sharing information with industry to allow expertise to be pooled. A cyber-threat has the capacity to evolve with almost unimaginable speed, with serious consequences for the nation&#8217;s security.</p>
	<p pid="a.805.2/11">In conclusion, I repeat our call for the Government to ensure that every company working with the Ministry of Defence, regardless of its size or the scale of its work, sign up to a cyber-security charter.</p>

	<p pid="a.807.0/1">I should declare an obvious interest as the MP for Cheltenham, since GCHQ is based in my constituency. This is also a topical day to debate cyber-security, because this morning the Deputy Prime Minister made a speech in which he talked about the balance that needed to be struck between digital freedom and national security. He praised GCHQ for its continued expertise and its role in defending us all against cyber-attack.</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/2">Although there is currently no cold war in the old sense&#8212;I hope that is not the wrong thing to say; perhaps events in Ukraine are making us worry a little about that, but there is no active cold war in the way there used to be in the 1960s and 1970s&#8212;we are in effect at war in cyberspace. Ongoing attacks are taking place against this country and its institutions and businesses, and it is right that in 2010 the national security strategy identified cyber as a tier 1 threat alongside international terrorism, military crises and major accidents or natural hazards. Although the &#163;650 million committed to the national cyber-security programme in 2011 sounded like a great deal of money, considering it against the billions being committed to Trident, for instance, which does not address any of those tier 1 threats, should give us some pause.</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/3">Trident addresses a theoretical and perhaps quite real future risk, and there are different views on that, but the cyber-security programme is defending us against current ongoing attacks. As hon. Members have pointed out, they are taking place at the rate of thousands an hour. It is almost like attacking an onion&#8212;Russian dolls would be the topical way of describing it. The core is the Government, the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces. We know that malicious e-mails are being blocked at the rate of 33,000 a month at the gateway to the Government secure internet. The next layer is defence contractors and the supply chain which, as other hon. Members have rightly pointed out, are just as critical to the successful operation of the armed forces and our defences as the Government core.</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/4">Critical infrastructure is the next layer. Hon. Members have rightly referred to banks and food supplies as part of that wider layer. The next layer is the wider economy</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/5">and society. The threat to business is a threat to our national security; 93% of large businesses and 87% of small businesses have reported cyber-attacks in the past year, potentially costing thousands, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40688" name="Iain McKenzie">the hon. Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie)</phrase> mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/6">The Defence Committee rang the alarm bell in 2013. It said that the risk of military operations being fatally compromised continued despite all the effort, and that we perhaps needed more resource and focus on cyber-security. It is right that we commit spending, and look at structures and process, but spreading the culture and practice of cyber-security matters at all levels, and across Government, business and society.</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/7">We have talked about the various units. I am pleased to say that GCHQ is in the lead, but the Global Operations Security Control Centre plays a vital role, as do the cyber-security information sharing partnership and various cyber-units in various places across Government. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40496" name="Crispin Blunt">The hon. Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt)</phrase> offered criticism of that proliferation of different units, but I believe the network approach is the right one. We need attention and focus in different places across Government. The last thing we want is for cyber-security to be silo-ed. We need the culture and practice of cyber-security to spread across Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/8">That was brought home to me recently when I visited Bletchley Park, and the brilliant National Museum of Computing, which was celebrating 70 years since the Colossus machine, arguably the world&#8217;s first programmable computer, started breaking the Geheimschreiber codes at Bletchley Park. A lot was said about the technical expertise of the Government code and cipher school, which became GCHQ, and the genius of Alan Turing and Tommy Flowers, the great engineer who led the Colossus team&#8212;I proud to say that my father was one his Post Office engineers. However, it was emphasised that human error allowed many of those codes to be broken. It was not just human error in the sense of mistakes that gave away code keys, but the fatal underestimation of Bletchley Park&#8217;s capabilities on the part of Hitler and the German high command. Right up until D-day, Hitler held back Panzer divisions in the Pas de Calais because he simply did not believe that the Normandy landings were the real deal&#8212;he believed the misinformation and the false intelligence that was being fed to him. It never occurred to him that the Geheimschreiber codes were being broken and that our side had that capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/9">I am pleased that GCHQ is in the lead on cyber-security and that it provides that technical expertise, but we need to spread the culture and understanding. By way of justifying the supplementary defence estimates to support that and other defence work, having that expertise has benefits for the UK economy. GCHQ has enormous links to academia, business and other parts of Government, but it supports cyber-skills at all levels, including encouraging maths, science and engineering in schools. I saw that at the Cheltenham science festival, although it encourages those subjects in many other ways. It also recognises academic departments that specialise in cyber-security. As has been said, they are now present in a large number of universities. That focus on high-tech skills, and research and development, could, and should already, make the UK a centre of global importance in cyber-security skills. In turn, that builds resilience, not just in Government but in businesses, making Britain a</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/10">safer place to do business in cyberspace. All those things have economic benefits and more than justify the spending we are considering.</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/11">There is a slight sting in the tail. GCHQ and its expertise are widely recognised now, which may be one of the benefits that it has inadvertently gained as a result of Mr Snowden&#8217;s recent activities. Business recognises that expertise and skill, and is able to poach very expert people from GCHQ and, perhaps, from the Global Operations Security Control Centre as well. The Government need to value the people in GCHQ and GOSCC, and others across Government, who have those extraordinary skills, and&#8212;sometimes, I am afraid, in material terms&#8212;try to ensure that we hold on to the best people, and the real skills and expertise. We need to value those skills in all sorts of different ways, but I hope that Ministers will not take it wrongly if I say, on behalf of my constituents, that that way would also be appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.807.0/12">We are facing a global threat. The United Kingdom is under current attack, and, while I think that the Government have got the strategy broadly right, I also think that they should not let up in defending us against this new and very 21st-century threat.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.809.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" speakername="Jim Shannon" colnum="809"  time="015:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#140304-0002.htm_spnew98">
	<p pid="a.809.0/1">Our society relies more and more on cyberspace in activities ranging from internet shopping to internet banking. More and more of our lives, and consequently our details, are online, and our constituents are affected by that every day. It is only right that the Ministry of Defence has a cyber-system that provides security, can be updated, and can be foolproof.</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/2">The national cyber-security programme puts in place &#163;650 million over four years to transform the United Kingdom&#8217;s cyber-security capability, of which the MOD&#8217;s defence cyber-security programme is part. The cyber-threat has a capacity for almost unimaginable speed, which could have serious consequences for the nation&#8217;s security. The nation therefore needs to do what it has not yet fully done, and provide the mechanisms, people, education, skills, thinking and policies that will make it possible to take into account both the opportunities and the vulnerabilities that cyber presents. If a reason for action were ever needed, that would be a very clear reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/3">All of us, both inside and outside the House, will have watched films on television in which Governments are brought down by computer networks. I remember thinking that that was science fiction and that it could never actually happen, but all of a sudden, in our own lives as elected representatives dealing with constituents, we have found ourselves relating to some of the issues with which they have had to deal in connection with, for instance, banks. There is a real, definite possibility, for which we must be prepared.</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/4">We have heard more and more about hacking skills. Businesses and livelihoods now depend on cyber-security for protection, and we have a duty to protect ourselves, to protect Government Departments, and to protect our constituents. Currently, 91% of UK businesses and 73% of UK households have internet access, and &#163;47.2 billion was spent online in the UK alone in 2009. The Minister has said that exact figures are hard to pin down, but a recent study by the Cabinet Office suggests</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/5">that cybercrime now costs the UK &#163;27 billion a year, with a cost of &#163;2.2 billion to the Government, &#163;3.1 billion to individuals in the form of fraud and identity theft, and far the largest proportion&#8212;&#163;21 billion&#8212;to industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/6">Cyberspace is a continually evolving environment, and if we are to defend ourselves from the threats that emanate from it, we must keep pace with that change. However quickly a threat is identified, 10 more will have been dreamt up by those who have the capability to do so. We must ensure that our constituents are protected, and, if necessary and if possible, educated as well. One cyber-security chief has pointed out in one of the national papers that even a simple password is better than no password at all, and that many people are frightened of terminology.</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/7">I was pleased to learn that the new cyber-security programme essentially seeks to build on the centralised approach established by the last Government, and to tackle some of the emerging gaps. It seeks to establish new cyber-security institutions and education and skills initiatives, with the aim of locating and addressing the weaknesses in existing cyber-measures, anticipating future threats, and building good working relationships across UK sectors, both public and private, as well as within nations. That certainly requires, and is worthy of, the funding support proposed in the motion. I hope that the Minister will be able to give us some indication of how, while the investment is taking place, all the regions of the United Kingdom&#8212;including Northern Ireland&#8212;can benefit from it. I am keen to understand how we in Northern Ireland can gain some direct advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/8">I understand that protection and security are essential for individuals and also for the Government and the Ministry of Defence, and the money must be used to maximise protection and education. The information provided by the Commons briefing stated the following, which determined my support for what has been proposed here today, because these facts and figures are horrendous. Some Members have mentioned them already. The director of GCHQ has described how cyberspace is contested around the clock. In the United Kingdom there are over 20,000 malicious e-mails on Government networks each month, 1,000 of which deliberately target that very department. The Security Service estimates that at least 20 foreign intelligence services are operating to some degree against UK interests in cyberspace. Again, that illustrates the scale of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/9">The US estimates that the Pentagon&#8217;s computer systems are probed 250,000 times an hour, with more than 140 foreign spy organisations trying to infiltrate US networks. During the 2008 Olympic games, Beijing alone experienced 12 million cyber-attacks per day. That underlines the magnitude of this problem and the importance of our being prepared and ready to combat it. I again ask the Minister to comment on the collaboration aspect of that. The report mentions our collaboration with the United States, as other Members have. Can the Minister explain exactly what that entails, and can he assure us that we will not be exploited by the United States of America and its Government?</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/10">On the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence, will Parliament be fully apprised of any decisions regarding participation in that and other international co-operative arrangements? It is important that everyone understands exactly what is proposed and what will happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/11">These attacks are happening around the world and in the UK and we must protect ourselves. I am therefore very happy to support the proposals, and I ask the House to support them too, while also ensuring that ever pound is spent effectively and enhances the skills of those in Government dealing with these threats. Other Members have stressed the importance of having skills in the MOD at corporal, sergeant and private level, so we can address the many pitfalls that may arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.809.0/12">While cyber-terrorism may not be physical terrorism of the sort that some of us in this Chamber have faced personally, and whose effects can be seen in blood and tears, the effects of cyber-terrorism can bring a nation to its knees and we must ensure we are not the ones who are brought to our knees, but are instead able to withstand any such attack.</p>

	<p pid="a.811.0/1">The greatest threat of electronic attack continues to be posed by state actors. Russia and China are suspected of carrying out the majority of assaults, but other countries&#8212;North Korea, Iran and even Syria&#8212;run very effective attacks too. The targets are in Government as well as in industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.0/2">Let me give an example of a cyber-attack. On <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-23">23 April 2013</phrase> the American stock market dropped 1%; it lost $136.5 billion in a matter of seconds because of a false tweet posted on the Associated Press Twitter account. That tweet apparently came from Syria.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.0/3">Let me give another example of a possible danger to this country, and here I will use information from a paper written for the Defence Committee by the distinguished academic Chris Donnelly. Huawei, a Chinese company strongly suspected of having close links to the Chinese Communist party and Government, is now providing crucial equipment for our national telecommunications system. The company has been debarred from doing that in the United States because it could not prove that it did not have strong links to the Chinese leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.811.0/4">Chris Donnelly&#8217;s paper highlighted three areas where Huawei could present a security risk. First, the company could insert undetected malware into its equipment, either to disable the system at will or at least to monitor it. Secondly, there is a possible security risk from the Chinese managers and technicians who man the system. Thirdly, allowing Huawei to dominate the field takes away our sovereign ability to deal with matters ourselves. Recently, there has been growing concern that our national cyber-security systems might not be able to detect whether malware has been inserted into the system.</p>

	<p pid="a.811.1/1">My hon. Friend is right to be concerned about the possibility that companies of all sorts might act against the interests of this country, but it is also right to record that Huawei is a major employer in the United Kingdom and is a multi-billion-pound multinational company. The suggestion that it is, in some way or another, an agent or a foreign force in the way he describes may of course be true, but it is worth saying that there is no evidence that that is the case.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.812.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" speakername="Bob Stewart" colnum="812"  time="016:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#140304-0002.htm_spnew101">
	<p pid="a.812.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that, but I am not sure that he is right. Huawei has been involved in setting up our cyber-security evaluation centre. It offered its services at knock-down prices&#8212;no western firm could match them, and our economy was and is in a poor position to resist the temptation of accepting what looked like a very good deal. So we could be setting a thief to catch that same thief. Of course the suspicions I voice may be erroneous and our cyber-security services could be totally on top of this one, but without access to classified information I have no way of checking. Members may recall that Huawei offered to provide a mobile phone system for the London underground during the 2012 Olympics&#8212;was it not free or close to being free? If I recall it correctly, that offer was turned down on security grounds.</p>
	<p pid="a.812.0/2">As Chris Donnelly highlighted, state security requirements and gaining commercial advantage are two sides of the same coin in China. We should be under no illusion about the Chinese&#8217;s willingness to put huge efforts into understanding and, if necessary, harnessing all sorts of systems in the UK to advance the Chinese national interest. Already there is a mass English learning programme in existence, which Chris Donnelly suggests involves 300 million people in China, and a similar mass programme to teach computing. In 2012, China conducted what it called its first &#8220;digital technology exercise&#8221; in Inner Mongolia, when an entire division of hackers in the uniform of the Chinese liberation army was deployed. These cyber warriors went to war across the whole spectrum of western activity, not just against western military communications. We are wasting our time calling on China to stop hacking into our systems. Of course the Chinese will deny they are doing it until they are blue in the face&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.812.2/1">Forgive me, my hon. Friend is absolutely right. He always stands up for the infantry, so he would use the word red, and I accept it; red is the colour of the infantry.</p>
	<p pid="a.812.2/2">We had better wake up to the fact that systematic and state organised hacking is a massive Chinese industry. I am pretty sure that our security services are well aware of the threat, but the public must also be made aware of it. We need the funding to do what we can to counter the threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.812.2/3">Let me be clear: hacking can be more deadly than a gun. Cyber-warfare, taken to its logical conclusion, could bring our society to its knees. Almost nothing works without electricity. I am talking about light, energy, traffic control&#8212;on the ground and in the air&#8212;hospitals, police and even sewerage. Undoubtedly, the national grid would be a No.1 priority target for someone wishing to reduce us to our knees. Von Clausewitz stated that war is an extension of politics by other means, but systematic hacking is also war, by new, subtle and probably very effective means.</p>

	<p pid="a.812.3/1">In a hands-free, wireless, bluetooth enabled world, how would any of us cope without access to our mobile phone or computer data for any duration of time? Our lives and livelihoods depend on those assets, and they would</p>
	<p pid="a.812.3/2">change fundamentally if they did not work. The recent flooding in Dorset affected electricity and caused some households to reach for the candles. What a new experience that was for a generation of people who perhaps take our world a little bit for granted. They believe that all these things that we enjoy are there and will not be challenged.</p>
	<p pid="a.812.3/3">I welcome this debate, and I commend the Defence Committee and its Chair for their report. My concern is that we are debating something that is changing almost daily and yet the report was printed on <phrase class="date" code="2012-03-26">26 March 2012</phrase>. In answer to my interventions at the start of the debate, the Minister made it clear that changes have been introduced, but even they will be out of date given the pace of change in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.812.3/4">As we move into an ever more digital and virtual world, we are increasingly exposed to attacks not just on personal data and intellectual property, but on state operations from air traffic control systems to electricity grids. Cyber-attacks are simpler and cheaper than a dirty bomb. We no longer see robbers running in to rob a bank; it is all done electronically. This is the world that we now need to recognise.</p>
	<p pid="a.812.3/5">Two years ago, I attended a course at Harvard university on national and international security. A cyber-security expert borrowed a laptop. He then purchased and downloaded $16 of software, and managed to tap into Boston&#8217;s traffic light systems. Had he taken it one step further, he would have been traced and got into trouble. None the less, he showed how easy and quick it would have been, with just $16 of software, to cause huge disruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.812.3/6">Let me place this issue in perspective. In the development of warfare, there are occasionally seismic leaps in capability as new systems are introduced, and they force all of us to adapt. Going back in history, the longbow changed the outcome of the battle of Agincourt. The introduction of the cannonball changed the way in which ships attacked one another, preventing the need to go on board. The introduction of the submarine, the tank, the plane and the aircraft carrier all changed the conduct of war. As has been said again and again in this Chamber, cyber-technology will provide a new dimension, which we all need to understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.812.3/7">I am a little saddened that the Chamber is so empty. I hope that it is not because I am on my feet.</p>

	<p pid="a.813.1/1">Thank you! The fact is it is the usual suspects who are here today, by which I mean those who are interested in defence matters. However, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> said, this issue does not affect just defence. It covers the business arena, the Home Office and the Ministry of Defence, yet we are not familiarising ourselves with the structures and processes so that we are at the front end of this capability. The speed of attack, if it happens, will be phenomenal. We have not yet seen anything on a scale that would fundamentally affect our lives, but there will be no build-up to such an attack. There will be no arms, tanks or ships mustering on the border; our lives will suddenly change when our computer systems no longer work.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.1/2">The UK&#8217;s military equipment is increasingly vulnerable because of the complexity of its IT. What would happen if we lost the global positioning system? How would anything operate and could we cope? When I was at Sandhurst, we were taught how to use a compass. I am not sure whether that happens any more, but if the systems go down, that is what will be required.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.1/3">Today&#8217;s statement on Ukraine reminds us of our involvement in the Crimean war and the charge of the Light Brigade. That infamous event took place because of a breakdown in communications, as by the time the orders reached Lord Cardigan, he had the wrong idea of what his mission was. Goodness knows what would happen today if we had insufficient resilience to communicate using our usual systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.813.1/4">Knowing a little about Joint Forces Command, I understand the logic of placing cyber-security in that domain&#8212;it is wise that it is fed into the command&#8212;but cyber-security should have its own distinct command with its own expertise, as is advocated by some in the United States. Additionally, the relationship between the Global Operations Security Control Centre and the defence cyber operations group needs to be clarified for those of us who were unable to participate in the Committee&#8217;s inquiry. Will the Minister update us on bringing together disparate groupings and organisations within various Ministries through the GOSCC?</p>
	<p pid="a.813.1/5">I support the call for the use of reservists. Banks and other financial services businesses are at the high end of ensuring that they protect their capabilities, so we need to determine how we attract people with the skill sets to do that job to work in the Ministry of Defence as well. Will the Minister tell us what is being done to encourage our NATO allies to improve joint capabilities? That subject might be suitable for discussion at the 2014 NATO summit, which will take place in this country. Given the damage and disruption that a cyber-attack might inflict, would a full-scale attack on another country be subject to article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty? Have rules of engagement been determined for offensive and defence cyber-operations?</p>
	<p pid="a.813.1/6">I welcome this debate and I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40455" name="James Gray">the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray)</phrase> that we should have defence debates more regularly. The House needs to understand this emerging threat that faces us all, as it is only a matter of time before a major strike takes place. I welcome the huge progress that the Government are making, but there is clearly much more to do.</p>

	<p pid="a.814.0/1">Labour Members welcome the increased focus that cyber-defence is receiving. The report by the Defence Committee is evidence of that focus, so I congratulate its members on their excellent work. Cyber-attacks are at last properly acknowledged as a serious threat to our national security and are rightly prioritised as a tier 1 risk in the Government&#8217;s 2010 national security document. As the Committee&#8217;s report says, the threat is liable to grow and evolve at &#8220;almost unimaginable speed&#8221;. Indeed, the pace of technological change is faster than traditional Government structures and time lines can cope with. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40058" name="John Woodcock">the Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)</phrase> said, five years is a long time in the cyber-world</p>
	<p pid="a.814.0/2">and the threat from cyber-attack is rising exponentially. The number of global web users in 1995 was 16 million; it is estimated that by 2015, there will be more interconnected devices on the planet than there are human beings.</p>
	<p pid="a.814.0/3">As communications technologies spread and as the UK critical infrastructure networks become even more heavily based on IT networks, cyber-defence becomes an increasingly pressing security concern. There will be even more attacks. According to the Government&#8217;s own national security strategy document, the UK faces up to 1,000 cyber-attacks every hour, which is estimated to cost the UK &#163;27 billion a year. Cyber-attacks are now a constant reality, with the Government, the private sector and private citizens all under sustained cyber-attack from both hostile states and criminals, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" name="Madeleine Moon">the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon)</phrase> articulated so well.</p>
	<p pid="a.814.0/4">I have no doubt that the Government take the threat of cyber-attack seriously, although perhaps not seriously enough. The report makes it clear that Ministers have not yet put in place the infrastructure to deal with that real threat properly, or approached the problem with vigour or sufficient robustness. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the right hon. Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase> said, the problem is agile and many-layered&#8212;I think it has been likened to an onion, and the Opposition would agree with that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.815.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" speakername="Bob Stewart" colnum="815"  time="016:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#140304-0002.htm_spnew108">
	<p pid="a.815.0/1">It is not an onion, because that implies that one peels away a layer to get at it; actually, it is an attack on all institutions&#8212;every single part of our society&#8212;simultaneously. I therefore disagree with the onion analogy.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.815.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40384" speakername="Yvonne Fovargue" colnum="815"  time="016:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0002.htm#140304-0002.htm_spnew109">
	<p pid="a.815.1/1">I will not be tempted to go further into vegetable analogies. I think the multi-layered approach is the one we are dealing with here.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/2">The Government have committed &#163;650 million over four years to the cyber-security programme, which seems like a significant sum, but only 14% of that was allocated to the Ministry of Defence, while the total investment equates to only 0.6% of the &#163;27 billion that the UK loses through cybercrime every year. In its report, the Defence Committee questioned whether enough was being done to secure the supply chain and the industrial base. We know that supplies of armed forces&#8217; equipment are increasingly being targeted, and are especially vulnerable to cyber-attack. In their response, the Government say they are working closely with industry on matters such as information sharing and incident reporting, but give precious little detail. The Government need to go further, and Labour is calling on them to ensure that every company working with the Ministry of Defence, regardless of its size or the scale of its work, signs up to a cyber-security charter. That will ensure that hackers cannot use the small suppliers to get into the systems of the major defence companies. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40688" name="Iain McKenzie">the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie)</phrase> said, the risks from cyber-attacks are huge and growing; we need to do everything we can to protect against them, and the MOD and its contractors should lead by example.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/3">The Government also refer to progress on the joint cyber reserve&#8212;an initiative to involve reservists in the delivery of cyber-security&#8212;but give little detail. Will</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/4">the Minister say what progress has been made in that important matter? I would particularly like to hear his thoughts on recruitment. The cyber reserves are not likely to be a traditional military outfit: the skills are entirely different. Is it essential that those reservists meet the usual fitness standards of the armed forces? A senior US officer said it was not essential that they were able to march 3 miles with a pack on their back, and I think most people would agree. It would be interesting to hear the Minister&#8217;s thoughts on the requirements for the new force and how its personnel will fit into the military model.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/5">What is the Minister doing to attract recruits? We have heard that a lot of the top universities are running cyber programmes with top computing graduates. Is the Minister attending those events or approaching careers fairs? Is there a career path that will be attractive to young graduates&#8212;we need not only to recruit but to retain those graduates. A recent study by the Army Families Federation shows that large numbers of married Army personnel want to leave the service. That will be all the more problematic with cyber personnel, as there are many lucrative private sector jobs tempting them away. But of course many of the skills and experiences required for this are prevalent in the defence industry. What steps is the Minister taking to encourage firms involved in Government contract work&#8212;not just in the defence but throughout Government&#8212;to encourage their staff to become reservists? What responses are there from such firms?</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/6">The new joint cyber-force is described by the Secretary of State in terms of its offensive rather than defensive capabilities, enhancing our ability to strike back in cyberspace against enemies who attack us. But as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40392" name="Dai Havard">the Member for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr Havard)</phrase> said, what are the rules of engagement? Land, sea and air have been the traditional theatres of war. Cyberspace is new and untested. What constitutes a cyber act of war and, equally important, what would be a proportionate response to an act of aggression? For example, if all London&#8217;s systems were knocked out by an electromagnetic pulse device, would that be an act of war? What would we do about it? As my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend said, how would we know who did it? In short, what are the rules of engagement?</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/7">It would also be interesting to hear whether the Minister believes that the concept of deterrence applies to cyber-defence as it does to conventional defence as perhaps those with the most ability to attack our cyber-capabilities have the least reliance on their own cyber-capabilities. What role does he envisage offensive cyber-capabilities playing in this? Do we work alone or in concert with others? The Secretary of State has made much of cyber-security being a sovereign capability but we have been working with other nations in supranational bodies for some time; for example we are a member of the &#8220;Five Eyes&#8221; group, which includes the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and we have also been working with NATO. The report cites the important work of the NATO cyber-defence centre of excellence. Of course this is based in Estonia and was created as a direct consequence of the cyber-attacks on that country in 2007. There is excellent work undertaken there and I am glad that the Government are committed to participation in the centre, although some may doubt whether the contribution of &#163;20,000 per annum will</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/8">have much impact. But the lesson to be learned here is that we cannot afford to wait until an attack happens before we act. We have to be proactive.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/9">Since the publication of the report, we have seen developments within the EU&#8217;s common security and defence policy. The European Council meeting on 19 and <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-20">20 December</phrase> last year led to a call for the development of an EU cyber-defence policy framework in 2014. I would be interested to hear what talks have been taking place about this. Working with, and within, bodies such as the &#8220;Five Eyes&#8221;, NATO and the EU is vital, not only for intelligence sharing but for developing common rules of engagement. We must be aware of the threat and how best to counter it. That is why we need all the organisations to work together.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/10">A further point is public trust. The public have to have trust in what we are doing to protect them and that is why accountability is so important. The USA has FISMA,the Federal Information Security Management Act,of course. What research has been done into how this might translate into our own system? We must also ask what role should Parliament and the Intelligence and Security Oversight Committee have in this new era of cyber-defence.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/11">Currently we are accustomed to thinking of security in terms of three forces; army, navy and air force. But in many ways cyber does add a fourth strand. Just as the creation of the RAF in 1918 demanded a whole new way of thinking about defence and war, the increasing cyber threat means that we need to do some fresh thinking now. We have to think seriously about how we can combat this new threat because one thing is certain; it can only grow. Conventional borders will have less and less impact but the impact on civilians and the military will be greater and greater.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.1/12">When the internet and electronic communications were first devised it was thought that they would impact only on academics in ivory towers. They have developed in ways that were never imagined then and have become an everyday part of our lives. Imagine a world without banking, power, communications systems, computers, control of our weapons. It absolutely does not bear thinking about, which is why we have to think about it and ensure that the MOD and the military are ready to take on this threat, and that they know their part, and play their part, in protecting our country and its citizens from this new and fast-evolving threat.</p>

	<p pid="a.817.0/1">I am sure that the whole House will wish to join me in recognising and thanking those members of the armed forces, both regular and reserve, who have been engaged in preserving lives and protecting property in those communities across the United Kingdom that have been struck by the recent storms and floods. They have provided very good service and we are immensely proud of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/2">May I also welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40384" name="Yvonne Fovargue">the hon. Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue)</phrase> to the Dispatch Box? Although she has been on the Opposition&#8217;s defence team for a while, this is the first time we have debated together directly, so I would like to welcome her to her post formally. I will do my best to answer at least some of the questions she asked in her speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/3">I would also like to thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40439" name="James Arbuthnot">the Member for North East Hampshire (Mr Arbuthnot)</phrase>, the Chair of the Defence Committee, for introducing the debate so ably and the 11 right hon. and hon. Members who have taken part so constructively. I have read the Committee&#8217;s report, which was published early last year, and the Government&#8217;s response. I will seek to address some of the Committee&#8217;s concerns and report to the House on our recent progress in this important field.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/4">It might interest Members to know that the term &#8220;cyberspace&#8221; is usually credited to the 1980&#8217;s science fiction writings of William Gibson. He used it as a buzzword to describe an all-pervasive virtual realm. Although there are many interpretations, we generally use the term to mean the interdependent network of IT infrastructures and the data that move therein. Cyberspace has become an essential part of most of our lives, from communications to shopping, and from life saving to war fighting. In 2013 some 21 million households in Great Britain had an internet connection. That degree of connectivity clearly has security implications that we cannot ignore.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/5">Although the MOD runs its own cyber-defence programme&#8212;I will say more about that later&#8212;the defence of our national cyber infrastructure begins within central Government, with the Cabinet Office playing a key role, as it does with all potential crisis management situations. All public and private sector organisations have a stake in addressing the threat, across international and domestic boundaries. To co-ordinate that effort, the Government created the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance within the Cabinet Office, which runs our national cyber-security programme. Alongside the Cyber Security Operations Centre, OCSIA works with other lead Government Departments and agencies, such as the MOD, the Home Office and GCHQ&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40163" name="Martin Horwood">the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood)</phrase> rightly paid tribute to his constituents there and the skills they have.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/6">The national cyber-security programme is backed up by &#163;860 million of Government investment from 2011 to 2016. That comprises an initial &#163;650 million allocated across Government at the time of the strategic defence and security review and an additional &#163;210 million investment announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer following the 2013 spending review. Moreover, given the seriousness with which we treat the cyber threat, since the Committee&#8217;s report the Minister for defence equipment, support and technology, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40378" name="Philip Dunne">the Member for Ludlow (Mr Dunne)</phrase>, announced in July 2013 that, on top of the money allocated to the MOD from the national cyber-security programme, the MOD has allocated a further &#163;70 million over the next four years from within our own budget for improving our cyber-defence capabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/7">The MOD&#8217;s key priority is to keep our own networks and systems defended and operational, so that if a crisis occurs we can continue to operate with the same efficiency and professionalism required on the battlefield. That does not mean that we cannot help in other ways, but the situation prevailing at the time will dictate how, when and if military assistance would be called upon.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/8">A number of hon. Members asked about MOD structures, as indeed did the Committee&#8217;s report, so perhaps I can provide some clarification. Since the</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/9">Committee&#8217;s report was published, the Chief of the Defence Staff has issued direction to the four-star commander of Joint Forces Command to empower him as the defence authority for cyber. On a day-to-day basis, that responsibility is delegated to the three-star Chief of Defence Intelligence in his unifying role to plan and develop cyber capability. Under CDI sits the joint forces cyber group, stood up formally in May 2013 to deliver that capability. The joint forces cyber group plans and directs the activity of the joint cyber units at Cheltenham and Corsham, including the reserves.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/10">The senior responsible owner for the defence cyber programme is the two-star director for cyber, intelligence and information integration, currently Air Vice-Marshal Jonathan Rigby, who gave evidence to the Committee&#8217;s inquiry in 2012, and remains accountable to the Chief of Defence Intelligence for those responsibilities. I hope that that helps provide absolute clarity about the chain of command.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/11">Our armed forces use some of the most sophisticated equipment in the world. The downside of the capability we possess is the potential exposure to emerging threats from our adversaries. We have to see those as an intrinsic part of modern military operations and put measures in place to mitigate or deal with them. The Global Operations and Security Control Centre, or GOSCC, is a key part of that protection, with its mission to ensure that we can operate and defend our networks.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/12">I was pleased to read in the report that the GOSCC&#8217;s performance impressed the Defence Committee, which said that it should be held up as &#8220;a centre of excellence.&#8221; I agree. I visited the centre recently and was struck both by the ability of the personnel and the interplay with the embedded industry professionals whom they work alongside.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/13">The Committee also rightly identified the importance of promoting good cyber-security practice. I fully accept that technology is only one part of the equation; we need the right people to do the right things. As cyber professionals often say, the majority of the threat that we face could be overcome by good practice on the part of our people. That point was well made by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40260" name="Jack Lopresti">the Member for Filton and Bradley Stoke (Jack Lopresti)</phrase>; we Front Benchers are also pleased to see him back here on good form.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/14">At the time of the Government response to the Committee&#8217;s report, we had already recognised the need for good practice and had included a specific cyber module in our mandatory training for defence personnel. Since then, we have gone further and developed a cyber primer&#8212;an easy-to-read, unclassified book that introduces personnel to the subject of cyber, particularly in a defence context, and is provided for all defence personnel to use.</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/15">In its report, the Committee noted the importance of exploring options to develop military capabilities. Since then, the Secretary of State for Defence has announced, on <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-29">29 September 2013</phrase>, that Britain will build a dedicated capability to counter-attack in cyberspace as part of our full-spectrum military capability. As we set out in the strategic defence and security review, the UK views cyberspace as a domain in which we can carry out military operations to support national objectives, as we would on land, at sea or in the air. The hon. Member</p>
	<p pid="a.817.0/16">for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr Havard) asked questions about the legality of that. I reassure him and the House that we are looking to develop a range of cyber capabilities that would be used in accordance with the well-understood laws of armed conflict and, more generally, would comply with domestic and international law. Any capability that we develop must be used legally. We are mindful of that.</p>

	<p pid="a.820.0/1">The Minister is making an extremely interesting and useful speech. In the context of the offensive use of cyber, does he believe that there can be such a thing as deterrence in the cyber world? Is there a way of finding out who the enemy is and deterring them by threatening the use of cyber-warfare ourselves?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.820.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40491" speakername="Mark Francois" colnum="820"  time="016:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#140304-0003.htm_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.820.1/1">A complicating factor is that it is not always immediately apparent where an attack may have come from. Sometimes it is possible to establish that a little later, but it cannot always be done instantly. That needs to be taken into account. However, I believe that the possession of a cyber capability that allows us to strike back could act as a deterrent to potential adversaries&#8212;not only in cyberspace but potentially against more traditional threats.</p>
	<p pid="a.820.1/2">A number of Members have asked about how industry fits in, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40496" name="Crispin Blunt">the Member for Reigate (Mr Blunt)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40688" name="Iain McKenzie">the hon. Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie)</phrase>. Private industry is and will remain a key partner in cyber-security. A secure supply chain is vital for the business of all public sector delivery, and that is no less the case in defence. Our armed forces depend on a wide range of equipment and services provided by industry. As part of the NCSP, the Government are working closely with industry to ensure that it is aware of the changing nature of the threat and has effective counters in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.820.1/3">The hon. Member for Makerfield asked for something specific to the Ministry of Defence. I am pleased to say that in addition, in July 2013, the MOD launched the defence cyber-protection partnership. That bespoke initiative aims to meet the emerging threat to the UK defence supply chain by increasing awareness of cyber-risks among our contractors and suppliers, sharing threat intelligence, and defining risk-driven approaches to applying cyber-security standards. In short, we already have something that is designed specifically for military and defence contractors and they are entering that programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.820.1/4">Technology is only one part of the equation. People are essential. We know that the number of deep specialists and experts in this field is limited, and that all organisations, both public and private, are looking to recruit from that supply. However, defence can offer an exciting opportunity for experts to put their skills to use for the nation through the formation of the joint cyber reserve. Some hon. Members asked about that, and I will provide an update.</p>
	<p pid="a.820.1/5">Recruitment to the joint cyber reserve commenced in October 2013, and there has been healthy interest. I cannot tell <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40117" name="Madeleine Moon">the hon. Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon)</phrase> how many of the applicants come from the Department for Work and Pensions, but I respect her assiduous work, as ever, in collecting statistics, and I have often been on the receiving end. I assure her and the House that we have recruited the first cohort of cyber reservists, and their training will commence in the spring.</p>
	<p pid="a.820.1/6">On the basis of the healthy interest so far, we believe that within the next two years the cyber reserve will be fully operational with reserve personnel recruited, trained and operating alongside their regular military and civilian colleagues in the joint cyber-units at Corsham and Cheltenham, and in the information assurance units.</p>

	<p pid="a.821.1/2">The cyber reserve offers individuals the opportunity to be part of the proud history and ethos of our reserves while working in a cutting-edge, technological field. The hon. Member for Bridgend asked about the effect on reservists if they travel to other countries. I will look into the good point she raised, and will return to her on that.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40066" name="Bob Stewart">the Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> made clearly, and so too must our view of this new domain. It is, therefore, essential that we work with our allies to ensure that we are not only able to operate with one another, but are aware of common threats. We are already working closely on cyber with our long-standing international partners, particularly through a defence cyber-contact group that includes the US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and ourselves&#8212;the traditional &#8220;Five Eyes&#8221; partners.</p>

	<p pid="a.822.0/1">This is a wonderful opportunity to recruit IT specialists from the civilian world to the reserves, but we have learned that this is a specialised area of work and we are looking at ways of extending the careers of people who work in cyber. For example, in the military, people might normally do a tour of two or three years and then move to a different position. We are looking at options for allowing people who work in this field to do longer tours of duty so that we can fully exploit the detailed expertise that they develop. We are looking at the matter carefully.</p>

The UK is proud to be part of the NATO co-operative cyber defence centre of excellence in Tallinn, and the MOD has already seconded a member of our cyber team to work there. I should tell the Chairman of the Select Committee that the Committee cannot take all the credit for that, but it can certainly take part of it. Furthermore, we have increased our co-operation with the NATO computer incident response capability based in Brussels by joining the malware information-sharing platform and the multinational cyber-defence education and training project.</p>
	<p pid="a.822.0/3">I assure the House that we are taking cyber very seriously in our defence planning. We are integrating cyber scenarios into our cross-defence exercise programme and combining it with the other domains of operations as part of full-spectrum planning, alongside land, air and sea. The cyber piece is becoming integral across the spectrum of military activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.823.2/1">It is a pleasure to speak about the report on the private rented sector by the Communities and Local Government Committee&#8212;its first report of the 2013-14 Session. The report was produced through the Committee taking formal evidence in a number of sittings. Some of those featured more informal discussions and some involved landlords and tenants together, which was interesting. There was a visit to Leeds to look at how the council was operating with regard to the private rented sector, and a visit to Germany to look at the sector in a very different sphere of housing circumstances. On behalf of the Committee, I particularly thank Christine Whitehead, who was the Committee&#8217;s special adviser for the inquiry, and Kevin Maddison, the lead specialist from the Committee staff working on the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/2">We chose the subject of the private rented sector not because of any particular initiative that the Government were proposing at the time but because of the sector&#8217;s increasing importance to our constituents. According to the latest figures for 2012-13, 18% of households now live in the private rented sector. That growth did not suddenly happen following the banking crisis of 2008; it had been taking place before that over a period of time. Indeed, it has been the only growing housing sector since 2002, when owner-occupation started to fall as a percentage of households. That is an interesting fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/3">The Committee saw the growth of the private rented sector not as a short-term issue but as something that is likely to continue in the longer term. We also observed that it is changing in that it is home to a wider range of households, particularly families with children who might, in other times, have chosen to be in a different sector but are now looking for a different housing experience, and particularly for more security. When people with children change their home, that often means changing schools, and that creates substantial disruption to family life.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/4">When we went to Germany, we saw a very different situation that we are probably not likely to get to any time soon. People literally have tenancies for life; many of us could not quite get our heads around that. Someone with a tenancy in Germany has it for life and can pass it on so that their family members can succeed to it. We learned that there were good standards in the private rented sector that we ought to seek to emulate in this</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/5">country. Tenants and landlords had an awareness and understanding of rights and responsibilities that is perhaps not always shared in this country. There was an equilibrium between demand and supply to which we aspire but recognise realistically that it will take some to achieve. Those factors create a very different market indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/6">We identified five main areas to concentrate on in our report: awareness of rights and responsibilities; the standards of properties and of how they are managed; effective regulation of letting agents, which we received an awful lot of evidence about; new tenancy models looking for longer-term agreements and greater security; and, in passing&#8212;because we had already done a report on this the previous year&#8212;increasing the housing supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/7">When it came to taking evidence, the then housing Minister&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk)</phrase>, who is in his place&#8212;was, as usual, very open to ideas and he welcomed, both in his initial statement in the House and in the Government&#8217;s response, many of our recommendations, as indeed did the then shadow housing Minister, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" name="Jack Dromey">the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)</phrase>. May I place on record the Committee&#8217;s thanks to the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford for the courteous, assiduous and highly knowledgeable way in which he always approached us and our deliberations?</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/8">There was a great deal of consensus right from the beginning. The Government have subsequently produced their &#8220;Review of property conditions in the private rented sector&#8221;, which includes many of the Committee&#8217;s ideas. Indeed, having initially dismissed our recommendations for mandatory carbon monoxide and smoke alarms in private rented homes and for five-yearly checks of the electrical installations, the Government are now consulting on them. Of course, consulting does not necessarily mean agreeing, but at least it is a step in the right direction, which we should recognise and welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/9">There are two areas on which we have not reached agreement and to which we need to pay more attention. The first is the flexibility of local authority powers to raise standards and to deal with rogue landlords in particular&#8212;I will say more about that in due course&#8212;and the second is the regulation of letting agents, on which the Government have not gone as far as the Committee wanted them to. I will explore that as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/10">On raising awareness, in Germany it struck me and, I think, other Committee members that tenants and landlords seemed to understand the rules and their responsibilities. That is not always the case in this country. Our report notes that there is a bewildering array of legislation and regulation relating to the private rented sector. Different Acts of Parliament are cross-referenced in new Acts and it is very difficult for any professional, let alone any lay person, to get their head around the situation. A professional landlord might understand some of it, but small landlords and tenants probably do not.</p>
	<p pid="a.823.2/11">We therefore called for a review on the potential consolidation of legislation, but the Government rejected that, which is disappointing because I think it would have helped to simplify things. We were not asking for more regulation; we were asking for simpler regulation. There is a difference. The Government could have scrapped some regulations if they had gone about it in a different way and that may have earned some brownie points for Ministers past and present.</p>

	<p pid="a.825.2/1">The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s opening comments are very much in tune with the views of the Committee. Does he agree that we recognised that the rented market is a relatively immature market and that, while we encouraged positive changes, one of the reasons why we were a little cautious in our approach was that we also recognised that we had to allow the market to develop and mature in its own way?</p>

	<p pid="a.825.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right and I thank him for putting that clearly on the record. That is exactly what the Committee agreed. Some of the changes will be incremental and there will be opportunities for either this or a future Government to come back and look at the totality of regulation and legislation, which I think would be helpful for everyone involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.3/2">On raising awareness, the Government have accepted some of the recommendations. The Committee called for easy-to-read fact sheets and model tenancy agreements. The Government have already produced a draft tenants charter and we look forward to their model tenancy agreement. That is entirely in line with what the Committee recommended, which was to try to make things easier, particularly for people who do not easily understand legislation and regulations, and to have something that is easy to operate. We felt that that would really help not only tenants, but many landlords, particularly non-professional, occasional landlords who have a few properties and would welcome such an approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.3/3">We asked for a review of the housing health and safety rating system. Again, it is valued by many professionals, but it is very difficult to understand for many landlords, let alone for tenants. I do not think that the Government are prepared to go so far as a wholesale review, but we note that they are now trying to produce guidance for tenants and to update the methodology. There are problems in relation to local authorities wanting to act against a property if the tenant is elderly, but not if they are young, and landlords can get confused about an authority requiring them to do work simply because they have changed tenants. It is certainly worth looking at that complication in the new guidance and new methodology.</p>

	<p pid="a.825.4/1">Years ago, we had what was called a rents officer, which would surely be one of the better ways of enforcement whether in relation to private landlords or higher rents in general. Rents are now escalating because the supply of housing is very low. Did my hon. Friend and his Committee consider that?</p>

	<p pid="a.825.5/1">We did, but I will come on to rents later, if I may, because that is a separate issue. We did refer to that matter, but the main point of our report concentrated on standards, which is what I am trying to address now.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.5/2">As we all know, the reality is that some of the worst standards in housing are in the private rented sector. That does not mean that every such property is bad and we should not give all private landlords a bad name, but as well as some of the worst properties, the sector has</p>
	<p pid="a.825.5/3">some of the most vulnerable occupiers, and that juxtaposition should really worry us. Some landlords simply want to sit and do nothing, while others blatantly break the law and think that they can get away with it, and we particularly want to bear down on them. There was general agreement about how to bear down on the really bad landlords without putting extra burdens on the good ones, and about how, at a time of financial constraint for local authorities, to enable them to take action against such private landlords and ensure that they can use their resources and recover their costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.826.0/1">I would add long-distance landlords to the list of problem landlords. I had a letter from a lady in west Sussex complaining about the condition of properties and various other things in the area of Church in Accrington. Many landlords in that area do not live there and have never visited it, and their properties are not in a particularly good condition. That is not necessarily for nasty or unpleasant reasons, but because landlords generally live too far away, and because they are amateur about making such an investment, rather than professional in housing management. Will my hon. Friend add long-distance landlords to his list?</p>

	<p pid="a.826.1/1">I do not want to say that every landlord who lives at a distance is a bad one&#8212;that would be wrong&#8212;but living further away can clearly make it more difficult for tenants to contact landlords and get instant responses about problems, particularly if they do not use a reputable agent to help them manage the property on the spot. We will come on to agents a little later. The issue is about local authorities having the powers to act against not merely individual properties, but areas with collections of properties in poor condition, which is probably the sort of area to which my hon. Friend refers.</p>

	<p pid="a.826.2/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his very generous remarks earlier. Houses in multiple occupation are a subset of the private rented sector on which there needs to be a real concentration. I certainly attempted to do that as a Minister, and I am sure that my successor is also seeking to do so. Does the Chairman of the Select Committee agree that we should often focus on HMOs in relation to the worst behaviour?</p>

	<p pid="a.826.3/1">Absolutely. The Committee was very supportive of the legislation on HMOs, particularly local authorities&#8217; use of article 4 powers to try to restrict the growth in their numbers in areas where there were so many that they had begun to dominate, as well as of the Government&#8217;s position.

	<p pid="a.826.5/1">Yes, certainly. One of the messages right the way through the report is that there is good practice among local authorities. As with many things that we</p>

The powers that are available to local authorities in respect of houses that are not in a fit state of repair are already quite extensive.

	<p pid="a.827.5/1">The Committee received evidence of concerns in some local authorities that the squeeze on their resources was affecting their abilities in respect of the private rented sector. We tried to look at how authorities could deal with the challenges that they face most effectively with the resources that they have. One thing that we looked at was licensing.</p>
	<p pid="a.827.5/2">On balance, the Committee did not come down in favour of a national licensing scheme. That is essentially because, over a number of reports, we have tended to be localist and to believe that local authorities should be allowed to make such choices for themselves. We went to Leeds, which has a very good accreditation scheme, under which there is good training and advice for landlords, which the landlords really appreciate. However, we were told by landlords and tenants that the problem is that it is the good landlords that join such schemes. They said, &#8220;It&#8217;s those landlords down the road you want to get hold of and they&#8217;re not going to volunteer.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.827.5/3">The selective licensing approach tends to be cumbersome, time-consuming and bureaucratic, and the criteria are very restricted. The Committee therefore asked whether we could relax the criteria and make them more flexible so that local authorities could engage in selective licensing if they wanted to. We also asked whether, in a more general sense, a local authority could have an accreditation scheme that was mandatory, so that it would include all landlords, including those who do not want to join.</p>
	<p pid="a.827.5/4">Unfortunately, on both issues, the Government&#8217;s response was not as helpful as we would have liked. They said no to mandatory accreditation schemes and no to a review of the flexibility of selective licensing. The Government&#8217;s recent consultation document does include changes to selective licensing, but they are talking about tightening the criteria, rather than making them more flexible. That seems to be a retrograde step. All our evidence suggested that that was too cumbersome and does not work, and authorities that want to make it work find it difficult to make it happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.827.5/5">We are apparently consulting on a landlord-specific, rather than property-specific, licensing or accreditation scheme, which the consultation document refers to as a suggestion from the Communities and Local Government Committee, although it was not. It has clearly come from somewhere, however, and it may not be unwelcome if it gives local authorities another set of powers and another way to deal with rogue landlords who are causing problems. If those landlords who persistently cause problems with individual properties have to become part of a mandatory registration scheme, that could be perhaps not a complete response to the Committee&#8217;s request, but at least a helpful step in the right direction, as we suggested.</p>

	<p pid="a.828.0/1">All the evidence from London suggests that the problem is not low demand as the criteria state, but high demand. Surely all that evidence leads us to believe that we need greater flexibility in licensing, otherwise we will not get to the heart of the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.828.1/1">Precisely, and the Committee&#8217;s view was very simple. These arrangements are&#8212;or at least should be&#8212;for local authorities to determine. Local authorities know their own areas and there is a big difference between one local authority and another. Even within London and within local authorities themselves there are big differences, so we hope the Government will recognise the value of giving a local authority a range of powers to tailor requirements to the needs of a particular area.</p>

	<p pid="a.828.5/1">My hon. Friend must be aware that in areas of high housing demand such as London, the six-month shorthold tenancy means that any tenant who has the temerity to complain about conditions to</p>

	<p pid="a.829.0/1">Yes, and the Government are consulting on retaliatory evictions as part of their consultation document, which is to be welcomed. One other issue that the Committee report dealt with that we must consider is how to encourage longer term tenancies. Families in particular want greater security. They may not want to be in the private rented sector, but if they are there and have a property they like, they probably want to be there for five years rather than six months. Considering how we can change the culture&#8212;that is what it is, as much as anything else&#8212;to get landlords and tenants to understand that there are possibilities within the framework of the existing assured shorthold tenancy for a tenancy longer than six months or a year, is a step forward. We must also consider how to get letting agents to recognise that they should be advising on that&#8212;letting agents often have a vested interest in regular reviews of tenants and tenancies because they make a profit and receive a fee every time they do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.829.0/2">We must also deal with the fact that many lenders prevent landlords from having a tenancy of more than a year. Nationwide is now, I think, prepared to accept a three-year tenancy, which is a good step forward, and the Government are trying to bring lenders together to try to make that change happen. I entirely accept the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North about retaliatory evictions when tenants complain. However, if landlords are to accept a tenancy period of three or even five years, they must have a way of getting the tenant out, rather than waiting until the end of the tenancy period. Shelter has accepted this and the Government have established a working party on it. That is being looked at as a quid pro quo. Shelter accepts that; it is not only landlords associations that have been pressing for it.</p>

	<p pid="a.829.4/1">The Committee called for more flexibility in licensing&#8212;perhaps that covers my hon. Friend&#8217;s point.</p>
	<p pid="a.829.4/2">The Committee recognises the need for more powers and action in one or two other areas to improve standards. We call for the possibility of fixed-penalty notices, so that local authorities can deal with less serious offences at relatively low cost. The Government are consulting on the range of measures that should be available. We also say that, when a landlord lets a property in an unfit</p>
	<p pid="a.829.4/3">condition and is prosecuted, it should be possible to claw back any housing benefit paid or any rent paid by an individual. We are pleased that the Government are consulting on that proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.829.4/4">One additional matter that the Committee did not get into&#8212;we might have a look at it in the autumn&#8212;is what happens when landlords are taken to court. That goes back to the fact that authorities are strapped for cash, as many are, and have limited resources. If a landlord is found guilty, the court should award the authority the full cost of the action. Sheffield, my local authority, advised me the other day that it has brought five successful prosecutions of landlords in recent months. On each occasion, it has not been given its costs back&#8212;it got back roughly 50% of its costs in total. That is not acceptable. We ought to put pressure on the courts&#8212;perhaps the Minister&#8217;s colleagues in the Ministry of Justice could do this&#8212;to recognise that, when effective action costs money and the landlord is found to be responsible for and guilty of an offence, the costs should be returned to the authorities.</p>

	<p pid="a.830.0/1">Order. I am sorry to stop the hon. Gentleman mid-flow, but he has been speaking for quite a long time, and lots of other hon. Members want to speak. I hope his two points are brief ones.</p>

	<p pid="a.830.1/1">Yes. On letting agents, the Committee is pleased to see a lot of demand for regulation. We are pleased that the Government are introducing a redress scheme, but are disappointed that the code of practice backing it up will not be mandatory. There ought to be more Government action on the lack of transparency in relation to fees charged by letting agents. They should not leave it to the current legislation, which needs tightening.</p>
	<p pid="a.830.1/2">Finally, on rents&#8212;this point has already been made&#8212;the Committee are not in favour of rent control. We believe that introducing rent controls is a blunt instrument that is more likely to curtail investment in the sector. Things should probably be done on local housing allowances, which could sometimes artificially inflate rents. There was evidence from Blackpool on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.830.1/3">To summarise, the Committee is pleased with many of the Government&#8217;s responses. We have concerns on the points I have made and are looking forward to Government action. The Committee will monitor that and look to the Government&#8217;s proposals to stimulate extra building in the private rented sector and other sectors to deal with the real problem in housing: the shortage of supply.</p>

	<p pid="a.830.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase>, the Chairman of the Communities and Local Government Committee. I have much sympathy with many of his points, but I welcome his generous and well deserved tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" name="Mark Prisk">the Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk)</phrase>. I am delighted to see him in the Chamber. He did a great deal in the sector in his time as a Minister and his work is appreciated on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.830.2/2">I declare an interest&#8212;it is in the register&#8212;as owner of a single property that I let out. That puts me in the same position as many private landlords, the vast majority of whom have a small property portfolio&#8212;it is generally fewer than 10 properties. I am also interested in the debate as a London MP. The private sector is particularly important in London, where housing costs are acute. I will then deal with the last point made by the Committee Chairman, which is on recommendation 30 of the report, on rents and affordability. I welcome the Select Committee&#8217;s view that rent control is not the answer, and I also welcome its view that what is really important is increasing supply. That is certainly critical to us in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.830.2/3">The Government have taken commendable steps. The establishment of the Build to Rent fund, along with the raising of that fund to &#163;1 billion, is a tribute to the work of my hon. Friend the Member for Hertford and Stortford, and to the continuing work of his successor, the current Minister. The &#163;10 billion in loan guarantees for the building of homes specifically for private rent is another important step. So the Government are doing a great deal, but we should be prepared to think outside the box and think about other, more imaginative ways of leveraging private as well as public money into the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.830.2/4">We all know that it is important for us to produce not just good-quality homes&#8212;and the quality of private rental stock is variable&#8212;but homes that will give people a degree of stability. An interesting comment was made in the pre-Budget submission by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which pointed out that a lack of affordable housing for rent in the private rented sector, and the difficulty experienced by many people&#8212;including many young professionals in London&#8212;in moving into market housing are increasingly presenting a potential bar to London&#8217;s economic competitiveness. It quoted a designer in London&#8212;very sensibly, I think; after all, the creative industries are an important part of the economy&#8212;who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.830.2/5">&#8220;When my employees see their rents shoot up, they come to me for a pay rise that I can&#8217;t afford to give them. This means I am always at risk of losing my most talented and experienced staff.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="a.832.0/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. That is the main point that I wanted to make in my speech. It is precisely because there have not been funding models to attract institutional investment that money has not been invested for long enough periods to underwrite the longer-term, more stable tenancy arrangements that we would all like to see. I think that what has been done so far is an important step forward, but it is ironic that under Governments of both political persuasions we have lagged somewhat behind other countries when it comes to leveraging institutional money into the private rented sector. REITs&#8212;real estate investment trusts&#8212;have never taken off in this country as they have in many others, and I think that that is a shame. Some adjustments to the fiscal treatment of those vehicles would be helpful.</p>

	<p pid="a.832.1/1">The biggest barrier to institutional investment in the private rented sector is the image of the private rented sector. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that we need to address that problem before the sector can attract any institutional investment?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.832.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40127" speakername="Bob Neill" colnum="832"  time="017:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#140304-0003.htm_spnew48">
	<p pid="a.832.2/1">I think that this is a classic case of &#8220;It is not an either/or scenario&#8221;. We certainly need to take steps to improve the image of the sector, which I believe is often unfairly castigated. A good deal of action is suggested in the report, and I would probably agree with the hon. Gentleman on some helpful steps that we could take. However, I think that we must do that in parallel with creating mechanisms that will bring in the institutional money. The two go hand in glove: they are two sides of the same strategy that we should be adopting.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.2/2">I want to say a little about what we could do to improve institutional investment in the private rented sector. There are obstacles, and this brings us back to the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>. In some cases land for private sale may be worth more than land for long-term rental. There are issues with speculative costing and valuation methods. We also need to look at whether there is some scope for using the private rented sector to create an income stream that could generate a source of cross-subsidy for affordable housing units, particularly in regeneration schemes, as rents rise. The current models we have tend to put the subsidy at the beginning of the system, in effect through the planning gain being taken out with the consequence that the landowner takes a lesser price on the sale or the market housing will be inflated a little to pay for the subsidy that comes via section 106 or the planning gain.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.2/3">That does not help in respect of the longer term funding streams we would like to see, however, and I hope the Minister will think about the following. I recently had the opportunity to talk with representatives of the New Economics Foundation. They have been doing some very interesting work in this field, and I commend the work in particular of Alicia Weston who has been doing some very interesting research. They have come up with a model that merits further consideration. It is a model for a defined income scheme that is designed to bring forward more rented housing. It allows private rental incomes to subsidise the rents of affordable units on a</p>
	<p pid="a.832.2/4">rolling basis and therefore gives the ability to have a long-term income flow. Indeed, it almost gives a bond that can be available to back up the investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.2/5">The housing that is created stays in the rented sector for the life of the scheme. One cannot guarantee beyond that, but that would none the less give valuable supply increases. A new form of contract would be required, which would be perfectly doable within current English law, between the local authority and the housing association, so that rather than setting a specified level of affordable housing on the site, the allowable income from the site is what is set. That income is made up of a combination of market and affordable rents and their levels are allowed to flex in order to make up the defined income. Provided there is the income, which is guaranteed and is therefore a quasi-bond, there is the stream to cross-subsidise. Under those circumstances, if market rents were to rise, as they have in London recently, the excess income would cross-subsidise more affordable housing. Conversely, if there is a revenue shortfall some affordable units can be switched to market rent, but the integrity of the income stream is preserved, and therefore the integrity of the investment model. That will give local authorities a semi-guaranteed stream that is not guaranteed by the public purse, but which creates something almost as good as a bond. I hope the Minister will look seriously at that. There are some practical issues that we will need to deal with, but pilot schemes are being considered around the country and I hope the Department will give schemes such as this one a fair wind.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.2/6">There is an advantage for housing associations there, too, because that more stable income stream is worth more to them and the increase in value will allow them to subsidise more housing or to unlock further sites and land for rented housing, either using a mix of the private rented sector or just affordable. This also encourages housing associations into the private rented sector, co-operating with institutional money, which might be an interesting approach to pursue.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.2/7">If applied sensibly, this scheme could lead to increased institutional investment in the private rented sector. I hope the Minister will look at that and encourage it. That can be done in respect of the whole scheme or simply the section 106 element. There is a degree of flexibility. I do not pretend it is a silver bullet, but we do need to think outside the box in leveraging in institutional money. There are a number of possible routes, and I think this particular one may be very timely.</p>
	<p pid="a.832.2/8">Overall, a healthy private rented sector is an important part of the housing mix, especially in large cities such as London, where the nature of the population frequently means that for a period of their lives people may well want the flexibility of living in the private sector before moving on to house purchase. They are likely to be earning incomes that mean they would never qualify for social rented housing, but they cannot at the moment access the market readily. Finding models that produce adequate housing supply for people in that situation is crucial for the health of London, my city, and of all the major conurbations in this country. So I hope the Minister will think about that as a model that is worth pursuing and that this report will generally find favour with the House. I also commend the Government&#8217;s response to it, which is a constructive one.</p>

	<p pid="a.834.0/1">On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. In my previous intervention I failed to draw the House&#8217;s attention to my declaration of interest, so I just want to set the record straight.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.834.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40124" speakername="Dawn Primarolo" speakeroffice="Madam Deputy Speaker"  colnum="834"  time="017:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#140304-0003.htm_spnew50">
	<p pid="a.834.1/1">Thank you, Mr Berry. That is clearly now on the record and is therefore in order.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.1/2">We now come to Mr Mike Kane&#8217;s maiden speech, to which the normal conventions of the House apply.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.834.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40700" speakername="Mike Kane" colnum="834"  time="017:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#140304-0003.htm_spnew51">
	<p pid="a.834.2/1">It was one of my predecessors, Alf Morris, who recruited me to public life. He said in his maiden speech that</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/2">&#8220;it was Aristotle who held it to be the essence of probability that some improbable things will happen.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1964-11-12.1280"><i>Official Report</i>, 12 November 1964; Vol. 701, c. 1280</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/3">And here I find myself, as only the fourth elected Member for the Wythenshawe and, now, Wythenshawe and Sale East constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/4">I must from the outset acknowledge the role played by the Prime Minister in my success. In a rather heated exchange at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions before the by-election, he and the Leader of the Opposition clashed over my candidature in the election. I want to place on record my thanks to the Prime Minister for the ensuing publicity in Manchester, helping Labour to secure one of the highest ever shares of the vote in the history of the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/5">I want to thank the electors of Wythenshawe and Sale East for returning me here and many Members on both sides of this House for the welcome I have received since coming here. It will be a privilege to sit on these Benches as a Labour MP, following in the footsteps of Keir Hardie, who created the party 114 years ago and is a hero of mine. It filled me with immense pride to welcome the leader of the Labour party, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40208" name="Edward Miliband">the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband)</phrase>, to the constituency twice in recent weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/6">I wish to pay tribute to my predecessors. In November 1950, the first MP for Wythenshawe, Eveline Hill, a Conservative, won the ballot for a private Member&#8217;s Bill and introduced the Deserted Wives Bill, which would have given security of tenure to women who had been deserted by their husbands after the war. Without enough votes, the Bill fell. In 1952, she, along with two female colleagues, wrote to <i>The Times </i>urging Conservative associations to adopt more women to help secure more progressive legislation&#8212;60 years later it would seem that the advice still applies.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/7">I mentioned Aristotle at the top of my speech, and it is often an Aristotelian confluence of events that brings any of us to this place&#8212;in my case, they were events that no one from any part of this House would have wished for. Paul Goggins was an extraordinarily dedicated public servant, and was loved and respected by all in this Chamber. He was a friend to many in this place, including to me and my wife Sandra. Justice and peace were his driving passions, and his ministerial work in the Home Office and Northern Ireland reflected that. His work with the victims of contaminated blood products and asbestos-related diseases was an extension of Alf Morris&#8217;s work in helping people who were chronically sick and disabled. As I walk these corridors, I am being</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/8">constantly told that I have big shoes to fill, and it is true&#8212;I do. However, I know that in one area at least, our shared and abiding passion for Manchester City football club, I will not let him down.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/9">Paul believed in the Augustinian notion of the world as it is and the world as it should be. He believed that we should strive on all sides, despite the tensions we face in this place and in this country, to create a better world. Such tensions currently include: the bedroom tax&#8212;or spare room subsidy; welfare reform; how to create a stronger economy; and the worrying situations we face in Syria and Ukraine. We cannot create that better world together without those tensions, and where better to do that from than the House of Commons, which has been the world&#8217;s leading instrument of revolutionary but peaceful societal change.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/10">I am proud to have been born in the constituency, to have lived in the constituency all my life and to have taught in the constituency. Now I am proud to represent the constituency. If we are to ensure that Wythenshawe and Sale East is to continue as a thriving place in which to live and work, supporting our transport infrastructure will be critical. The country&#8217;s first municipal airport, Manchester, lies within the boundaries of the constituency. Granted a licence in 1929, it was established in 1933 by the Manchester city council by just one vote&#8212;56 to 55. Now it is one of the biggest drivers of the economy in northern England.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/11">Light rail is critical to the constituency. There is a long-established line through Sale and a route in development through Wythenshawe to Manchester airport. Heavy rail is also critical, with the establishment and growth of the rail hub at Manchester airport. Unfortunately, we still have no railway station on the Stockport to Chester line that passes through the constituency. We look forward to welcoming High Speed 2 and its station in Wythenshawe at some stage in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/12">Speaking of HS2, Edward Watkin, who was a Member of this place in the 19th century and a resident in Northenden in my constituency, oversaw the construction of the great central main line, a purpose-built high-speed railway line of its day; and also oversaw a failed attempt to dig a channel tunnel under the English channel to connect his railway empire to the French rail network. That vision was realised only l00 years later, but as Disraeli said 200 years ago:</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/13">&#8220;What Manchester does today the rest of the world does tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/14">More unusual routes through the constituency include the trans-Pennine trail, a cycling and walking route along the banks of the River Mersey, an off-road intercontinental route from Hull to Liverpool in the UK, and a route from Galway to Istanbul across the rest of the continent. The Bridgewater canal is also highly significant. Built by the Duke of Bridgewater in 1761, it brought coal to power the industrial revolution in Manchester, which changed the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/15">To create that better world that we all want to see, we must continue to champion the people whom we represent, to listen to their stories and to help them build their own power through strong relationships and action. Eveline Hill believed in a better world in which deserted</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/16">wives would have greater rights and in which there would be more representation and diversity in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/17">Alf Morris believed in a better world for people who were chronically sick and disabled. He successfully introduced a ground-breaking private Member&#8217;s Bill in 1970, recognising their rights to lead a life of dignity and worth. Likewise, Paul Goggins believed in that better world for people with HIV and hepatitis C infection from contaminated blood products and for asbestos victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/18">As the son of Irish immigrants, I am proud to serve in this legislature. My parents strived for a better world. I remember at the age of 10 being rehoused in an affordable three-bedroom council house. I saw how that lifted their spirits. I envision a world where all people can have a home, regardless of their status, that lifts their spirits and does not sap their energy; where people can access the job of their choosing and be treated with respect and dignity in the workplace; where more people are paid a living wage and are free from the tyranny of the loan sharks and where people have access to fair credit.</p>
	<p pid="a.834.2/19">The primary purpose of our leadership in this place must be to create more leaders, not followers. St Paul in his letter to the Ephesians implores us all to lead a life worthy of our calling. I hope to do so.</p>

	<p pid="a.836.0/1">It is an honour and a privilege to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40700" name="Mike Kane">the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)</phrase>. I think that I speak on behalf of the whole House when I say that his speech, which was his first from the Opposition Benches, was both witty and excellent. I am sure that those on the Government Benches join me in wishing him many happy years&#8212;on the Opposition Benches.</p>
	<p pid="a.836.0/2">I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in the debate, which has been led so well by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase>, who is an excellent Chair of the Communities and Local Government Committee. He guided the production of last year&#8217;s report and, indeed, our reply to the Government&#8217;s response. I draw the House&#8217;s attention to my entry in the Register of Members&#8217; Financial Interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.836.0/3">There are some 9 million people in the private rented sector. As we have heard, that sector is now larger than the social rented sector and, in many years, it will catch up with the so-called owner-occupier sector. Those who talk about owner-occupation should remember that most people who buy a house do not actually own it. They have borrowed the money to buy the house, but it will be 25 or 30 years until they can say that they own the property in which they live.</p>

	<p pid="a.836.1/1">I do not want to distract my hon. Friend from his speech, but may I bring to the House&#8217;s attention recommendation 37 of the report, which deals with data quality? It cannot be found in any of the English housing statistics the proportion of homes that are leasehold, which is something that gives rise to a whole set of problems. Martin Boyd of the Leasehold Knowledge Partnership estimates that the number is 5 million, but those homes do not get much attention, so perhaps the Select Committee will examine what more needs to be done in that area.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.837.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" speakername="Bob Blackman" colnum="837"  time="017:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#140304-0003.htm_spnew54">
	<p pid="a.837.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, and the Committee will have to examine that matter further.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/2">In the borough that I have the privilege of representing, there are twice as many privately rented homes as there are properties owned by registered social landlords. That dwarfing of the social rented sector gives rise to a series of problems. In London, and especially the outer London suburbs, owners no longer sell properties, but vacate them and rent them out privately. The properties are often rented as houses in multiple occupation, but without them being registered as such, which creates the problem that many single individuals are renting properties collectively. Such people are often young men from eastern Europe who live together in one big house. There are many properties in which beds are rented out for eight hours a day, meaning that three individuals will occupy one bed in a room in sequence when they are not fulfilling their jobs and roles in society.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/3">The HMOs in this country that are registered are few and far between, so I want the Government to put in place much more stringent registration requirements for HMOs. There are only 89 registered HMOs in my borough, but I could take Members to a single ward in Harrow in which there are more than 89, but they are unregistered, and therefore unlicensed and unregulated. As the report shows, we clearly need to deal with the problem of standards, and the Government need to take more action on the registration and regulation of HMOs.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/4">That takes me on to the problem of beds in sheds, because the fact is that unscrupulous individuals are using relatively high rents and high demand for housing&#8212;throughout the country, but especially in London&#8212;to force people to live in substandard accommodation. I made a long speech about the private rented sector in the pre-Christmas recess debate. I will not repeat some of the points I made about the condition of properties and the problems in the sector, but I commend what Slough council did to draw up a heat map of its borough to ascertain the number of properties in which it was likely that there were bed in sheds. My own borough, Harrow, was not given Government money for the purpose but has just done a heat map of the area. We discovered 329 properties with buildings outlying or adjacent to the main house that are occupied. I am told that, as a result of the exercise, the police have also found a number of cannabis farms, which are another threat, not only because the domestic properties in question are no longer available to rent, but because cannabis farms lead to illegal trade. Clearly we need much stronger government intervention and much stronger Government support for local authorities to ascertain all the unscrupulous landlords who are not registered with anyone, but who are cramming people into substandard accommodation and ripping them off in the rent they charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/5">During the debate, we have heard about the problems caused by the lack of stock, but we should be clear: it is a scandal that the last Labour Government presided over the lowest level of housing development since the 1920s. The reality is that planning permission was granted for relatively few properties and, sure enough, few properties have been completed in the past three years because of the lack of investment and the failure of the Labour Government to make it happen. I commend my the</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/6">Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40338" name="Kris Hopkins">the Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins)</phrase>, and his predecessors for taking action to encourage new housing development, which will lead directly to improvements not only in the private rented sector but in all sectors of the housing market.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/7">During the stages of producing our report, the Committee looked at evidence from a wide variety of sources. One of the concerns expressed was about the regulation of managing agents, and I want to draw out the absolute scandal of the charges that unscrupulous managing agents levy not only on landlords but on applicants for rental properties. Frequently those charges are excessive, going beyond reasonable costs, and are levied multiple times, as the agents charge both the landlord and potential tenants. For example, we heard evidence of hundreds of pounds being charged for credit checks that, broadly speaking, would cost between &#163;8 and &#163;10 to conduct. That is a scandal. There is a need for clarification and more regulation in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/8">In certain areas, the bureaucracy involved in registering is also a problem. The borough of Newham has introduced a policy of registering every single private rented property and requires landlords to fill out the same complicated form for every single property they rent out. The Select Committee has not yet had a proper answer from the Government about whether that is actually a requirement. I would welcome the Minister stating his view, not necessarily at the Dispatch Box tonight but in the future, that people do not need to do that. If the landlord in question is a large-scale, reputable landlord, the simple fact of registering their ownership of a property in the borough should be sufficient, but there is no reason why a small-scale landlord&#8212;one with, say, fewer than 10 properties&#8212;should not fill in the necessary forms and register properly, because it will need to be checked and verified that they are acting in a particular way.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/9">I remind colleagues that for most landlords in the private rented sector, the yield on capital employed is in the order of 3% or 4%. Most people who rent out property privately are not necessarily doing it for the income&#8212;the review&#8212;they gain, but for capital growth. At present, interest rates are historically low.</p>

	<p pid="a.838.0/1">I am interested in what the hon. Gentleman says. Where a former council property, which has often been bought with a very large discount historically, is let out at five or six times the rent charged by the appropriate local authority, that bears no relationship whatever to the capital employed and, frankly, is just plain greed.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.838.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" speakername="Bob Blackman" colnum="838"  time="017:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#140304-0003.htm_spnew56">
	<p pid="a.838.1/1">Clearly there are issues around where there is greed and where there is not. I am coming to a particular issue that is of importance to the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/2">Given that the yield is relatively low&#8212;an average of 3% to 4% is true across London and may be true across the rest of the country as well&#8212;and given that that money can be borrowed at perhaps 3% or 3.5%, a single half of a percentage point increase in the Bank base rate would lead to an increase of almost 20% increase in the amount of money people are paying their lenders for their mortgages. Think of the effect of that on rents. Given that the yield is only 3%, imagine if there were a 20% or 25% increase in what landlords must pay in interest rates for their mortgages. The effect of that</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/3">would be enormous on the price of rents. It would have a knock-on effect on the housing benefit bill because, in many cases, housing benefit is paid to those in low-paid jobs, particularly in areas of London. That will be a clear concern in the coming weeks and months.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/4">One of the things that I would stress&#8212;it is important that we send out this message&#8212;is that it vital that we have a Government who continue to bear down on interest rates and maintain reducing the deficit as key. That is one of the reasons why we cannot let the Opposition have any say in Government or on housing policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/5">The final issue that I want to raise briefly is the key issue of the length of tenancy that applies. One of the key issues from our report was that we should have longer tenancies and more settled arrangements for families with children in schools who are building up a community of interest, rather than potentially having families being evicted after a six-month shorthold tenancy. However, that must go hand in glove with the ability of landlords to be able to evict tenants who do not pay their rent or who badly misbehave. That has to be one of the things where we will need intervention. We need the Government to take action to promote longer tenancies, and we need more responsibility from landlords and from tenants. We then need applicable rates where rents will rise with inflation so the position is more flexible for everyone in the housing market. We need lenders to recognise that longer tenancies are to their benefit, and to the benefit of their borrowers and of the people who reside in the properties.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/6">Landlords will always say that a good tenant is worth keeping and worth keeping happy. A good tenant will say that they are happy in a property, that they want to stay and that they want a long-term relationship with the landlord. Bad tenants who do not pay their rent or who misbehave or cause antisocial behaviour clearly need to be evicted, and quickly, at the lowest possible cost to the landlord. If we can get some answers from the Minister tonight on those issues, that will be of great help to the sector and the rest of the market.</p>
	<p pid="a.838.1/7">Finally, we have to be clear that this is a market. If we intervene in a market, it can have untold consequences and possibly consequences that one was not anticipating. This is one of the areas where we have to proceed carefully because we do not want to distort a market and cause further problems. With certain targeted interventions comes the potential for improving the market and for improving the lot of tenants and landlords combined.</p>

	<p pid="a.839.0/1">I join <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" name="Bob Blackman">the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase> in congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40700" name="Mike Kane">the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)</phrase> on his maiden speech, which I thoroughly enjoyed&#8212;it certainly made me laugh. I wish him well as he tries to follow in the steps of St Paul. I do not mean Paul Goggins, although for many of us he was a bit of a saint, but St Paul of the Bible, who took on many people in government before his premature demise.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/2">I worry that I am treading on old ground when I say that we are currently in the midst of the biggest housing emergency in a generation, but it is worth repeating that</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/3">we continue to build less than half the number of homes we need to keep up with demand, if only to hammer home the severity and scale of the problem. All the while, private landlords, many of whom leave much to be desired in the caring and service department, continue to hike rents, often at the expense of the taxpayer, who has to foot the bill for many people forced by the failures of Government to claim housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/4">I am therefore pleased to welcome the Communities and Local Government Committee&#8217;s report and its conclusions, which cover: simplifying the law; promoting rights and responsibilities; proper enforcement powers for local authorities; better regulation; a crackdown on unfair charges; longer and more secure tenancies; and a renewed effort to boost housing supply in order to increase choice, quality and affordability.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/5">Sadly, I cannot say the same for the Secretary of State&#8217;s response. He writes of burdensome red tape hampering private landlords, proportionate regulation that will let them off the hook and measures that will give tenants the know-how to demand longer-term tenancies, stable rents and better quality accommodation, to avoid hidden fees when renting a home and to demand better standards, but all without any real requirement on landlords to agree. He also writes of the</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/6">&#8220;small number of rogue landlords&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/7">who need to be dealt with, and optional model tenancy agreements that no one needs to adopt. It is not exactly a charter for the sector&#8212;certainly not for tenants. I welcome the funds to encourage more people to build new properties for rent and the compulsory redress scheme, although it is not clear how vulnerable tenants will take on the might of landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/8">However, none of that will deliver the house building revolution we need. A great concern is that the housing crisis is not a problem that exists in isolation&#8212;quite the opposite. A failure to build is but one link in a chain reaction that is having damaging effects for many people. With housing costs increasing, real wages falling and energy bills rocketing, not to mention the other bills that we must all factor into the cost of living, the chronic shortfall in building is driving that crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/9">Hard-working people across the country are being left unable to afford the homes they need. The average home now costs eight times the average wage. It took just three years for an average family to save for a deposit on a home in 1997, but today it will take the same family 22 years, if they are able to do so. But the number of affordable homes built over the past year dropped by more than a quarter.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/10">As I sit on the bus each evening going to my Battersea flat, I am amazed by the number of apartments being built along Battersea Park road, each a tiny box costing several hundred thousand pounds. On behalf of the people of north-east England, I envy London the thousands of jobs and&#8212;in this apprenticeship week&#8212;the hundreds of apprenticeships that have been generated on those sites. It is just a shame that the vast majority of Londoners will never be able to buy and live in those apartments and will have to rely on the private rented sector instead. I could advise those people to move north, even to my constituency, where they will be able to secure a family home for a fraction of the cost of some of the box-sized apartments in London. The cost of living and quality of life is better, too. But why would I advise them to move</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/11">to a region starved of housing investment, despite the efforts of our local authorities, and where unemployment continues to rise in most parts?</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/12">I would offer a solution. The Government could work to restore the north-east by encouraging some of the multi-million pound investment in housing and industry we see in the south-east to move north. Do that and build on the region&#8217;s successes, which include being a huge exporter of manufactured goods, including petrochemicals, steel, cars and a whole range of other goods. If houses could be delivered across the north-east at just a fraction of the rate in the south, we could have our own boom time.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/13">What is most alarming about the shift away from home ownership is the simultaneous shortage of affordable and social housing. That extends far beyond the scarcity of one-bedroom properties that is blighting the socially rented sector as a result of this Government&#8217;s malicious bedroom tax and reaches past the confines of London, where rents are increasing by as much as 10% a year. Across England, 5 million people are on local authority waiting lists for social housing. As a result, the private rented sector plays and will continue to play an important role in meeting our housing needs. However, all too often private renting is unaffordable, unstable and subject to poor conditions and bad management.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/14">The recent English housing survey for 2012-13 has shown that, for the first time, the private rented sector has grown larger than the social housing sector, with 4 million households compared with 3.7 million. The trend towards growth in the private rented sector is self-reinforcing, driven by the combination of factors that confront aspiring buyers looking to get on the housing ladder. People want to buy, but cannot do so as little affordable housing is available. They cannot even save a deposit while renting because of the shortage of low-cost social housing. To make matters worse, that all comes at a time when real wages have fallen at a rate of 2.2% a year since 2010&#8212;the longest such period in half a century.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/15">One of my primary concerns is that so many homes in the private rented sector continue to fail to meet the decent homes standard. Although the number of houses in all sectors failing to meet the required standard has fallen in recent years, one in five households&#8212;almost 5 million properties across the country&#8212;are still substandard. In the private rented sector, however, a third of all properties fail to live up to the expected benchmark, the highest proportion of non-decent homes in any sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/16">Some in the private rented sector would have us believe that they have been cleaning up their act, as the proportion of private rented sector homes classed as non-decent has fallen from 47% in 2006 to 33% in 2012. That is all very well, but that statistic conceals the fact that the absolute number of non-decent dwellings did not decrease over the period. Private landlords could take a lesson from the social rented sector, just 15% of whose properties miss the decent homes standard&#8212;although that, of course, is 15% too many.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/17">Proportionally, roughly three times as many homes in the private rented sector failed to meet the decent homes standard as a consequence of disrepair or poor thermal comfort&#8212;two key indicators of housing quality&#8212;compared with the social rented sector. Private landlords</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/18">could learn much from my own Stockton-on-Tees borough council&#8217;s work on insulating hard-to-heat private properties; Tristar Homes is doing the same in the social sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/19">There is a broad consensus that the reputation of responsible landlords in the private sector is being undermined by a minority of criminal landlords who deliberately prey on the vulnerable, but there are problems that we cannot overlook and sweep under the carpet. There are the &#8220;couldn&#8217;t care less&#8221; landlords, the absent landlords and the anonymous landlords who are happy to take the rent but do nothing for their tenants. Some let properties to anyone prepared to pay, and in some areas create misery for neighbours and the wider community.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/20">Just a week ago, a distressed woman was in tears in my surgery after years of trouble from one set of aggressive and noisy tenants after another, placed next door to her by a landlord who takes no responsibility whatever. The situation is all too common. We know that when standards reach unacceptable levels, regulatory and enforcement tools are available to local authorities. However, using those tools is often a last resort, partly because of regulatory red tape, meaning that poor standards can persist for too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/21">Yet of the 4 million households in the private rented sector, 25% received housing benefit in 2012-13 to help with the rent, up from 19% in 2008-09, as wage values drop, low paid part-time jobs replace well paid full-time ones and people are forced to fall back on the state. That means that the Government are, in effect, increasing subsidies for low quality homes. That would rightly be considered a scandal at any time&#8212;even more so when the money could be used to boost house building in the social rented sector and benefit some of the millions of people in need of high quality affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.839.0/22">Over the past three decades, in excess of 1 million council properties have been sold through the right-to-buy policy and its variants. About a third of the ex-council homes sold in the 1980s are now owned by private landlords charging rents more often than not staggeringly higher than rents in the social sector. In the social rented sector, the average household rent in 2012-13 was &#163;89 a week, while the equivalent figure for the private rented sector stood at &#163;163, a difference of &#163;74 a week. In some local authority areas in the north-east, as many as 72% of those in the private rented sector are entitled to rent support through housing benefit. With 80,000 households renting private accommodation entitled to housing benefit across the north-east region, private companies are benefiting massively from the welfare system. For example, Stockton Flats has taken more than &#163;1.7 million from councils throughout the north-east, the north-west and north Yorkshire, including &#163;775,000 from Stockton-on-Tees and &#163;260,000 from Redcar and Cleveland. Similarly, Castledene Property Management has benefited hugely from Durham and Newcastle councils.</p>

	<p pid="a.842.1/1">I am grateful, Mr Speaker. I have a few paragraphs to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.842.1/2">The companies that act as private landlords are reaping the rewards of the housing crisis that is afflicting so many people in Britain, and driving growth in the buy-to-let market while stifling the building of the affordable and social homes that so many hard-working people want and need.</p>
	<p pid="a.842.1/3">I will cut short my comments, Mr Speaker. I will simply say that the report from the Communities and Local Government Committee offered the Government robust recommendations, and I am saddened that the Secretary of State is not giving them much credit.</p>

	<p pid="a.843.1/1">I extend a warm welcome from the Liberal Democrat Benches to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40700" name="Mike Kane">the new hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)</phrase> and congratulate him on his maiden speech. When I made mine years ago, it was terrifying. The hon. Gentleman acquitted himself admirably, as I am sure he will continue to do over the next 12 months. He said a lot about Aristotle, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.843.1/2">&#8220;It is the&#160;mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.843.1/3">I think you will agree, Mr Speaker, that that is what we often do in this place when we listen to one another speaking across the divide.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.1/4">It is clear that over the last 30 years, housing in this country has changed dramatically. The country has moved away from the high level of social tenancies that used to dominate the landscape. Now, more than 8.5 million people live in private rented accommodation. Many of the people I speak to most weekends at my advice surgeries dream of owning their own home. That dream has been handed down through generations, and it helps to create a stable family life and a meaningful existence. We cannot build a big society if we do not have roots in the society and the community in which we live. People who are subject to the transient churn of the private rented sector all too often fail to grip the community around them and engage positively with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.1/5">People&#8217;s dreams of owning their own home are becoming harder to realise. The average age of a first-time buyer is rising, and is now 37, the size of deposit required to buy a home is ever higher, and bank lending has become more stringent in recent years. When ever-increasing house prices, due to shortage of supply and high demand, are factored in, a significant part of society may never be able to own the home to which they aspire, or will struggle for decades to do so. For them, the private rented sector is the only realistic option.</p>

	<p pid="a.843.2/1">I am sure my hon. Friend will explain how the issue affects his rural constituency. Will he acknowledge that it is a problem not only in the large urban stretches of London, but in smaller cities such as Norwich?</p>

	<p pid="a.843.3/1">My hon. Friend is exactly right. The problem is not restricted to one part of our country, but is a national housing crisis. I consider myself to be a</p>
	<p pid="a.843.3/2">fairly astute observer of politics from time to time&#8212;perhaps on high days and holidays&#8212;but I fail to understand why the issue is not higher up the political agenda. The House is reasonably well attended today, but election after election passes without housing achieving the penetration of public consciousness that it deserves. A generation is frozen out of the housing market, millions of people are on waiting lists for social housing, and, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40579" name="Alex Cunningham">the hon. Member for Stockton North (Alex Cunningham)</phrase> said, millions more are living in inappropriate conditions in the private rented sector. There will be a moment at which housing bursts through, and when that happens I suspect that whichever party is best able to capitalise on the public anger will be rewarded at the ballot box.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.3/3">The private rented sector sees a huge turnover and is inherently unstable. In my view&#8212;I share the analysis of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" name="Bob Blackman">the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase>&#8212;that is partly because of the nature of the short-term tenancy arrangements within the sector. Often agreements will be for six months, or 12 months if you are lucky. Almost inevitably, there will be annual rent increases that are above inflation or above the retail prices index or the consumer prices index. As the hon. Member for Stockton North said, there is a failure by landlords to invest. This often creates a churn in the private rented sector that is undesirable for the people who are in it and for landlords, as well as for our wider communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.3/4">We should not make the mistake of thinking that all the people who are renting are students or young people. In fact, half of all private renters are over 35 and a third are families. Moving is not always desirable for people who are trying to create deep links with local schools and other links with local communities, and it is our job as Members of this House to recognise that. The housing charity Shelter, which does excellent work across the piece but particularly on this issue, says that two thirds of renters in England want the option to stay in their properties for longer periods, and eight out of 10 want to know that they are not subject to the annual unpredictability of rent rises. This shows that the private rented sector is not fluid because of consumer choice; it is not what the individuals who are renting want to happen. They are victims of the market who are concerned about punitive rent increases and the motives of their landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.3/5">I fully endorse the suggestion by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East that the Government need to bring forward measures on longer-term tenancies that will benefit property owners and renters. The Government should make overcoming the inherent short-termism that is built into the system a priority.</p>

	<p pid="a.844.0/1">I commend the speech by my new hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40700" name="Mike Kane">the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)</phrase>, who represents the great city of Manchester. He is one of the few people who could survive a headline saying &#8220;New MP for Sale&#8221; without being investigated by the Committee on Standards in Public Life. I congratulate him on the wit and intellect that he used in his maiden speech, and on the tributes that he paid to his predecessors. One characteristic of both Alf Morris and Paul Goggins was that they commanded rather a lot of respect and affection on both sides of the House. That is a trick that</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/2">most of us have not pulled off over the years, I have to say, and I hope he manages it. I pay tribute to some of the work that got him here, including his work on promoting a living wage and on trying to undermine and replace the loan sharks who batten on a lot of poorer people. I am sure that he is very welcome in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/3">I welcome the report by the Select Committee and commend the hard work that it has put in, but I am afraid that I do not think it goes anything like far enough in dealing with the problems of the private rented sector in London. Londoners are being priced out of London, and young Londoners are suffering most. Whether they are seeking to buy or to rent somewhere to live, all the options are being taken out of the reach of ordinary people. Over the years, housing policy in London has been a failure, and there is now a housing crisis the like of which I cannot remember in all the time that I have been involved in local politics.</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/4">When I first became an MP, I knew that a nurse at Great Ormond Street or University College hospital would not be able to afford to live in the area. Over the years I realised that, increasingly, junior doctors would not be able to afford to live in the area surrounding those two great hospitals. It has now reached the stage where a new specialist consultant can no longer afford to live in the area, which is a ludicrous and damaging situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/5">Younger people who are starting careers and who want to start a family and to find a place to live are being pushed out by house prices and rents that have been rising out of hand. The badly off have been hammered and the situation in London is such that&#8212;these are official figures&#8212;the average weekly rent now exceeds 50% of the average weekly pay. It is not just the badly off who are being driven out; it is people on middling incomes and young professionals who are hoping to start a career. They certainly cannot afford to buy and increasingly they cannot afford to rent.</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/6">In the past few years, private rents have gone utterly mad. It is not just me who is saying that. A recent headline in the <i>Evening Standard</i> stated: &#8220;Half Londoners fear they&#8217;ll be forced to leave neighbourhood: Housing costs in London &#8216;driving us out&#8217;&#8221;. A few days later the paper had a similar headline: &#8220;Rents rise 8 times faster than wages&#8221;. These are unsustainable increases.</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/7">The fact is that the private rental market is failing. It receives a &#163;9 billion subsidy from the taxpayer&#8212;&#163;9 billion of housing benefit goes to the private sector. It does not reside in the pockets and handbags of the tenants; it goes to the landlords.</p>
	<p pid="a.844.0/8">The situation now is such that rents are going up, but the supply is going down. Another headline from the <i>Evening Standard</i> read: &#8220;&#8216;Generation Rent&#8217;&#8221;&#8212;that is how young professional people are being referred to &#8212;&#8220;suffers in overheated market as housing supply slumps.&#8221; The idea that high, unregulated rents are bringing resources into the private sector is simply not true. Some argue that some sort of regulation or control might harm the supply, but it could not harm it any more than the free market is managing to do at the moment.</p>

	<p pid="a.846.0/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. I think I invented the phrase &#8220;social cleansing&#8221; and sometimes I refer to it as the lowland clearances, which might be of interest to our colleagues in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/2">A headline in <i>The Sunday Times</i> stated: &#8220;Buy-to-let returns top 10 % a year: Investors piling into the market as yields soar&#8221;. The supply is not soaring, but the yields are and it is time we shifted the balance in favour of the tenants, with greater security, and longer tenancies. I believe that we cannot afford to avoid introducing rent controls. In fact, I would go further and say that there should be a progressive reduction in the level of some of the rents and that, in future, rent increases should be tied to wage levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/3">We of course have the problem of the massive increase in house prices, which is a major factor in the rise in rents. One of the biggest factors is foreign buyers. Some of them buy property in London to live in, but they are a small minority, because most of them now buy residential property simply as an investment that they leave empty. To read another <i>Evening Standard</i> headline, &#8220;Super-rich from overseas flock to buy homes in London&#8221;. They do not intend to use them as homes; they are simply an investment that is better than putting their money in gold. They cause a double damage or blow to people in London: they drive up prices; and they take a lot of housing out of supply, because the places that they buy and do not occupy could otherwise be occupied by other people.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/4">We cannot stop EU citizens buying residential property in this country, but we can stop other people doing so. The Government have established a precedent, because they have said that a private landlord must not let to a tenant who is not lawfully in the United Kingdom. I believe that we should change the law so that people cannot sell residential property to somebody who is not entitled to be in the United Kingdom. That would have a dampening effect on these massive rises in house prices.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/5">As the Government are now scrambling around in contemplating sanctions against Russia, may I suggest that, as a pilot scheme, we quickly pass a law to prevent Russian oligarchs from buying houses and flats in this country unless they are entitled to live here, because all that happens is that landlords, estate agents and property companies are making money? They have contributed little or nothing to making London a better place to live. In the southern tip of my constituency, which includes Covent Garden, people&#8212;with their children or their parents&#8212;battled for years in the 1970s to prevent the wholesale destruction of Covent Garden and to preserve it as the great success that it has become, but they can no longer find anywhere in Covent Garden to live, because properties are bought up by other people, whether British bankers or foreign owners.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/6">We also have the problem of Crossrail, which has cost &#163;16 billion, most of which has come from the taxpayer. With a fanfare of trumpets, the people now running Crossrail have announced that some firm of valuers is predicting, again to quote the <i>Evening </i><i>Standard</i>,</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/7">that &#8220;Crossrail &#8216;will boost property prices by up to 25 per cent&#8217;&#8221;. It has cost billions of pounds of taxpayers&#8217; money, but someone else will benefit from the increase in property values.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/8">In all I have said, I have been very careful to avoid mentioning any socialists, and I will now mention a very unsocialist person. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/9">&#8220;Do you think it would be very unfair if the owners of all this automatically created land value due to the&#8230;enterprise of the community&#8230;had been made to pay a proportion&#8230;of the unearned increment which they secured, back to&#8230;the community?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/10">That was Winston Churchill at the great Free Trade hall in the great city of Manchester in 1909. He was right then, and he is right now. My view is that if there is to be a massive increase in property values as a result of Crossrail&#8212;I have always supported Crossrail&#8212;the public should get some of it back.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/11">I will quote somebody else:</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/12">&#8220;Both ground rents, and the ordinary rent&#8230;are a species of revenue, which the owner, in many cases, enjoys without any care or attention of his own. Though a part of this revenue should be taken from him in order to defray the expenses of the state, no discouragement will thereby be given to any sort of industry.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/13">He went on to suggest that rents are</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/14">&#8220;the species of revenue which can best bear to have a peculiar tax imposed upon them.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/15">That is what Adam Smith said in the &#8220;The Wealth of Nations&#8221;. If the Tories claim to be Churchillites or say that they support the Adam Smith Institute, it is about time that they adjusted some of their policies in line with what those distinguished people advocated.</p>
	<p pid="a.846.0/16">It seems to me that there will be no prospect of ordinary folk continuing to afford somewhere decent to live in London until we introduce rent controls and reductions, introduce a tax on gratuitous increases in values accruing to landlords, and do something to stop the stinking rich foreigners buying up residential property in this country. When people talk about immigration, they say that there will be all sorts of burdens on the infrastructure. The suggestion seems to be that there will be such a burden only when poor people come here. The fact is that the people who are recruited by the City from abroad also want somewhere to live. They impose as great a burden on our housing stock as anyone else. I therefore think that we need a much more radical approach. That no doubt betrays me, yet again, as being not old Labour, but heritage Labour.</p>

	<p pid="a.847.3/1">I genuinely enjoyed the speech by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40700" name="Mike Kane">the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)</phrase>. I also enjoyed knocking on doors in his constituency a few weeks ago in the pouring rain. I am pleased to have helped him get into this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.847.3/2">I am speaking in this debate because I am a member of the Communities and Local Government Committee, which conducted the inquiry, and because this issue is thoroughly important to my constituency as many of my constituents live in the private rented sector. This inquiry is one of the most interesting and important inquiries we have conducted because it relates to a large proportion of the British population. I enjoyed the inquiry and found it particularly informative. I will canter through three issues: simplifying the legislation, empowering local government and thinking about the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.847.3/3">The Chairman of the Committee mentioned the importance of regulating the private rented sector, as did others. He also mentioned that tenants, landlords, local authorities and everybody else who is involved in the sector find the legislation complicated. It adds to the costs, causes confusion and creates a lot of hassle for those who want to rent a house. I hope that the Government will review the legislation to make it clearer and simpler.</p>
	<p pid="a.847.3/4">As the private rented sector is so large nowadays, there is an opportunity for the Government to conduct a public information campaign on how it relates to tenants and potential tenants. There are also issues with letting agents, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" name="Bob Blackman">the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase> and other Members pointed out. It is important that there is a breakdown of the fees that tenants are paying. There is a view that there should be a national licensing scheme, but although I agree that national guidelines could be useful, I think that is done better by local authorities. Local government needs the ability and flexibility to decide its own licensing schemes that are particular to the local housing area.</p>
	<p pid="a.847.3/5">On localism, local authorities should be given more powers to tackle rogue landlords, but we should bear it in mind that there are also rogue tenants, as has been pointed out. There are 1.2 million landlords, many of whom could be described as accidental. The vast majority are good, but there are a few rogue landlords who treat people badly and prey on vulnerable people, particularly the old, students and immigrants. That needs addressing by giving local authorities greater powers to impose penalty charges and the chance to recoup costs.</p>

	<p pid="a.848.0/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that we need to address the problem of people who cause a massive nuisance to their neighbours, because the present laws and practices are quite pathetic?</p>

	<p pid="a.848.1/1">I completely agree with my right hon. Friend, and there is an issue about rogue tenants, which is the point I am making. On unscrupulous landlords, my right hon. Friend mentioned the subsidy through housing benefit, and those rogue landlords are often receiving public money, using it badly, and treating their tenants badly. There is a need for greater powers for local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.848.1/2">On the longer term prospects, I have two quick points. First, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40300" name="Bob Blackman">the hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman)</phrase> said, there is a real issue of people wanting longer term tenancies. The Government can do something to help and assist that, perhaps by looking more closely at Germany in creating longer term tenancies, particularly for families and those who want to stay in a location for a lot longer than they currently do. Finally, in the long term more broadly we need to start building more</p>
	<p pid="a.848.1/3">homes. Whether this Government or the next get that under way&#8212;whichever party is in office&#8212;that is the key to this complex problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.849.4/1">I was expressing concern about my Friend&#8217;s reading list&#8212;Adam Smith and Winston Churchill &#8212;but he assured me, and he is quite right, that there was a radical tinge to Churchill who also introduced wages boards. There was also a radical tinge to Adam Smith, although he was grossly misrepresented by the far right of the Conservative party many decades later. We will not debate that.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/2">I congratulate my Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40700" name="Mike Kane">the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)</phrase> on his election and membership of this House, and on an absolutely superb opening speech. I have never heard anybody start with Aristotle. I hope he carries on in that philosophical mode. It was absolutely brilliant.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/3">I will be brief, you will be pleased to hear, Mr Speaker, because those on the Front Benches wish to wind up the debate. Like my Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras, who has the neighbouring constituency, I represent inner London where the housing crisis is acute beyond belief. I hold regular advice bureaux, as all Members do, and my walk-in advice bureau on the third Friday of the month frequently lasts for anything from six to eight hours. The vast majority of the people who come have housing issues, and they are devastated by the situation they are in. They are often people who have been placed in the private rented sector by the local authority, which must house them because they are in desperate housing need and the family is in danger of homelessness, or has medical needs and so on. I do not blame the local authority for that. People&#8217;s rent goes up, their housing benefit is capped, they cannot afford to meet the gap, and the only alternative for them is to be moved out of the area to a distant place. At the moment, my borough does not place people outside London, but I suspect it is only a matter of time before all London boroughs decant people outside London because they simply cannot find the private rented accommodation to house them. Schools are disrupted when families are moved out and the community is weakened. The flats are then rented to somebody at an even higher rent.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/4">I am pleased that the Communities and Local Government Committee has decided to concentrate on the private rented sector. I agree with much in the report, including the regulation of letting agents, better conditions in the private rented sector, the guaranteed return of deposits, and the protection of tenants against unfair eviction because they have the temerity to complain to local environmental health services.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/5">I would like those measures to be introduced, but we must address the elephant in the room&#8212;the rents levels in the private rented sector. In answer to a question from me yesterday, the Minister asserted that private rented sector rents in London are going up by 1.4% per year. I tested that out on a few people last night in my constituency. The answers ranged from, &#8220;Which planet is he living on?&#8221; to &#8220;Did he mean 1.4% per week?&#8221; There is a total disconnect between the figures the Department works on and the reality of life for people in the private rented sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/6">Government Members say, &#8220;We cannot interfere with the market,&#8221; but we are already doing so. As my Friend the Member for Holborn and St Pancras has pointed out, the public are putting &#163;9 billion a year into the hands of private landlords. That is market interference. I support housing benefit, but it has an effect. No rent regulation is associated with housing benefit, and there is no control on rent levels. That must be addressed. I recognise that, in most of the UK, private rents are not excessively high. In many parts of the country, they are lower than council rents. When I talk to colleagues about supporting my ideas on the regulation of private rents, they say, &#8220;It&#8217;s not an issue in my area.&#8221; I fully understand that, but in London and on the fringes of London, and in one or two other cities, it is a massive issue. A third of my constituents live in the private rented sector. They ask me, &#8220;How much longer can I afford to stay in your constituency?&#8221; Some of those people are not poor&#8212;their salaries are quite good. They are young professionals who want to live in an inner-city area of London but can no longer afford to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/7">There is a knock-on effect on the London labour market. I have been to the Royal Mail sorting offices in my constituency, the local hospital&#8212;on many occasions&#8212;the fire station, the police station, social services, the council departments and other places, and have asked people where they live. If they are under 40, the chances are that they live at home with their parents. They do not want to&#8212;the parents often do not want them there either&#8212;but are stuck in that situation. If they have managed to buy a place, it is a very long way away from London, and they spend an awful lot of time and money on commuting, which has an environmental effect. A few years down the line, where will the nurses, the teachers and the firefighters come from if we do not address housing for people who need houses and places in London?</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/8">To my local authority&#8217;s great credit, it is building council houses. It hopes to complete about 2,000 with the housing associations on affordable or social rent models. That is making a good difference to a lot of people&#8217;s lives. It is a great pleasure meeting families who have lived in grossly overcrowded, poor-quality accommodation when they get a decent, permanent, reliable and secure council flat. That has changed their lives, and has changed the attitudes of the young people involved. However, we are not doing enough of it; instead, we are letting the market rip, and allowing all the problems that go with that to arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/9">I have introduced a Bill under the ten-minute rule procedure, the Regulation of the Private Rented Sector Bill. I think that the majority of Members would find most of it unexceptionable. It deals with the need to regulate letting agents. We could start with Criminal Records Bureau checks&#8212;in some cases, that would be quite helpful&#8212;and then move on to full regulation of</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/10">the way in which agents charge, the extent of their transparency, and so on. Not all letting agents are bad, just as not all private landlords are bad, but there are some pretty seriously rogue elements.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/11">Agencies discriminate blatantly not only on grounds of ethnicity and race&#8212;as &#8220;Panorama&#8221; discovered&#8212;but against people on benefits. They say &#8220;We will not allow anyone who collects benefit to rent a flat through this agency.&#8221; Why do they do that? It is an interesting question, because someone who pays part or all of his or her rent by means of housing benefit will actually be a very reliable tenant. The answer can only be that the agencies do not want the attention of HMRC to be focused on the levels of income they are receiving.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/12">We need regulation to deal with that, we need transparency in regard to how deposit schemes work and how tenants get their deposits back, and we need serious attention to be paid to the longevity of tenancies. Six months for assured shorthold tenancies is far too short; at least five years strikes me as a reasonable basis, although obviously there should be an appropriate form of get-out clause for people who, for instance, get a job in another part of the country. That can be worked out.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/13">Other countries manage to regulate rents. Germany has a very regulated and a much bigger private rented sector, and, in general, private rented properties are owned by much larger landlords&#8212;co-operatives, insurance companies or others. When the Minister without Portfolio, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40643" name="Grant Shapps">the right hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps)</phrase>, told me that regulation of the private rented sector would bring about the economic ruin of Britain, I asked him whether that was a parallel with the economic ruin that Germany was facing as a result of its regulation of the sector. I am still awaiting his answer; I do not know when he will be able to give it to me.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/14">My Bill proposes that local authorities should play a key role, because they understand the communities they represent. Newham council, Oxford city council and a number of other authorities have introduced registration schemes, and have sought to introduce some degree of regulation of the private rented sector. Of course, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase>, the Chair of the Select Committee, pointed out, the problem is that it is the good landlords who tend to register voluntarily, and it is the rogues whom we want to be registered. Nevertheless, that is a good initiative and a good step forward. Moreover, if local authorities introduced their own private letting offices, they could use them for their own purposes when they have to house families in the private sector because they do not have enough council houses to deal with the demand.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/15">The Bill also proposes that a combination of the Mayor and London boroughs should be given the opportunity to introduce a rent registration and rent regulation regime across London, which would have some bearing on the affordability of properties. That would give access to housing to a range of people who are currently excluded from it, and would thus create more stable, more harmonious communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/16">I welcome the work that the Select Committee has done, and I welcome the fact that we are beginning to have a serious debate about the private rented sector. It should be remembered that more than a third of the communities in many parts of London are already</p>
	<p pid="a.849.4/17">living in the sector, and that, according to all the predictions, it will grow a great deal. I very much hope that this will become a big issue at the next election. I hope that parties including my own will understand the need for regulation and the need to limit the excessive rents that have been charged, so that we can bring about some sense of harmony and decency in this sector of the housing market throughout the country.</p>

	<p pid="a.852.0/1">I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40700" name="Mike Kane">the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)</phrase> on making an excellent maiden speech, and I can see he is going to be a real champion for his area. I, too, remember campaigning for him, and not only in the rain, but in the wind and rain, and it was very much worth it to have him here. I am sure his warm and moving comments about his predecessor are greatly appreciated on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/2">We have had a very well-informed debate, and I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase> and his Select Committee on producing such an excellent report and on highlighting the key issues relating to the private rented sector. It is a pity that the Government&#8217;s response to the Committee&#8217;s report did not rise to meet the sensible challenges it set out. Indeed it is still a mystery to me why one of the first actions of this Government when coming to office was to put an end to the planned regulation of the sector of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40644" name="John Healey">the Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey)</phrase>. As a result, four years on, all we have is a consultation and we have lost a valuable opportunity to identify and address key issues facing the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/3">Both the Government&#8217;s response to the Committee&#8217;s report and the subsequent consultation paper on property conditions in the private rented sector show huge complacency. Yes, the Government are consulting in some areas, but they are not addressing the main issues that the Select Committee report highlights, such as affordability, poor standards in some cases, lack of security of tenure, lack of regulation for letting agents, illegal evictions and lack of protection for the tenant. It is important that they do address these issues, however, because, as lots of Members have said today, increasing numbers of people now rely on the private rented sector for their housing. We think the figure is now about 4 million households, which is the highest ever.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/4">It is now more important than ever to address some of the long-standing and growing issues that are affecting ever more people. In its report, the Select Committee identifies as the first major issue the need for a simpler regulatory framework. There is a case to be made for consolidation of the legislation relating to the private sector, which is currently dispersed and complicated, and such action would make it simpler for tenants and landlords to understand their respective rights and responsibilities. Clarity will also make things more accessible for both tenants and landlords and may help to reduce some of the problems that arise, and consolidation would also make things easier for local authorities. What is absolutely vital, however, is that councils are able to put existing, and any subsequent, legislation and guidance in place locally in an effective way, and I am pleased that my hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/5">(Simon Danczuk) pointed in his speech to the importance of enabling a localist approach and of getting good local policies in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/6">The Committee is right to highlight the need to raise standards in the sector. Too often unscrupulous letting agents are ripping people off; people and families that are renting are subject to a lack of stability through short-term tenancies and unpredictable rent increases; and too many homes are of a poor standard. Some 33% of all privately rented homes are estimated to be non-decent with one in 10 homes in the sector suffering from damp and mould.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/7">The Committee&#8217;s report highlights the considerable concerns of many in the sector and identifies some real problems, but the report also offers potential solutions to these issues, recommending empowering local authorities to tackle problems and penalise landlords who fail to maintain the necessary standards. The report recommends that local authorities should be able to retain the money recouped to fund further work to raise standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/8">However, despite the report&#8217;s extensive recommendations, the Government have taken a step back and simply published what they describe as a &#8220;discussion paper&#8221; which they make clear</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/9">&#8220;does not recommend any policy or legal changes&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/10">at all to address the issues that have been raised about the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/11">While the Government&#8217;s consultation on standards in the sector is welcome, it comes almost four years into the Parliament and as a direct result of pressure from the Select Committee, campaigning organisations and the work of many of my colleagues on this side of the House. It does not make up for up for their failure to tackle this growing problem sooner.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/12">The same applies to the Government&#8217;s attitude towards the licensing of landlords. At the moment, local authorities do not even know how many landlords are in their area or how to contact them. We want to help local authorities identify those bad landlords whose housing is not up to scratch and who break the law. That is why we have proposed a national register of landlords, but we have been clear that our aim is to empower and enable local councils to have tools to achieve that locally. The Select Committee&#8217;s report recommends giving local authorities the flexibility to license in their local area and to require landlords to be part of a regulatory scheme. The report proposes lots of different ways of doing that, but the important point is that local authorities need the powers. We want to ensure that if a local authority knows that poor standards are a significant problem in its area, it has the proper powers to deal with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/13">Labour-run Newham council became the first council in the country to introduce a borough-wide mandatory licensing scheme for all landlords in June 2012, and it is seeking to prosecute 134 landlords for breaches under the initiative. Despite its success, many local authorities have told us there is too much bureaucracy and red tape in their way if they want to step in and introduce licensing schemes. Similarly, the Local Government Association believes:</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/14">&#8220;Councils should have greater local discretion on the qualifying criteria and the amount of evidence provided for local licensing schemes&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/15">Yet the Government appear insistent in continuing their lack of action on this matter, stating in their response to</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/16">the Select Committee report that there are already tools available to local councils and ignoring the Select Committee&#8217;s valuable recommendations. Indeed, they are ignoring a great deal of the evidence from local authorities and others on this issue that was presented in detail to the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/17">The same is true when it comes to the issue of houses in multiple occupation. As was suggested by the former housing Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40313" name="Mark Prisk">the hon. Member for Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk)</phrase>, this is a particularly thorny issue. The report considers HMOs in some detail, with paragraph 63 on page 26 considering article 4 directions. I know that the Committee received some evidence that article 4 directions could be used to limit the number of HMOs in a particular area, but I am not sure that article 4s are the right approach or the right tool for this purpose. Many local authorities tell us that they are a clumsy way of trying to control HMOs and that there should be an easier way for councils to regulate HMOs in their area. So we want to make it easier for local authorities to address local problems more simply and directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/18">Similarly, we also want to make is easier for local authorities to deal with letting agents. According to estimates, some 4,000 managing and letting agents are entirely unregulated, in that they do not even belong to voluntary bodies that encourage a responsible approach to letting and management practice. It is a peculiarity of current policy that while estate agents, who hold very little money on behalf of their clients, are regulated, letting agents, who hold significant sums on behalf of landlords and tenants, are not. Good letting agents have a worthwhile role in providing professional input and support, but too often tenants and landlords alike are ripped off by unscrupulous letting agents. We have said we will regulate letting and management agents, and bring an end to rip-off fees. The Government&#8217;s moves to require letting agents to be part of an approved redress scheme are welcome, but their action comes only after prominent campaigning by Labour and, in particular, by my colleague in the other place Baroness Hayter. We think that without her efforts the Government would not move on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/19">Another major issue identified in the Committee&#8217;s report is that of tenancies and rents. The report clearly says of the sector:</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/20">&#8220;No longer can it be seen as a tenure mainly for those looking for short-term, flexible forms of housing&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/21">We want to encourage the Government to take stronger action on introducing longer-term tenancies.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/22">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40579" name="Alex Cunningham">the Member for Stockton North (Alex Cunningham)</phrase> raised a number of points related to addressing affordability and supply issues right across the country. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40319" name="Frank Dobson">the Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Frank Dobson)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> drew our attention to the particular issues of affordability and supply in London. The Select Committee did not focus in this report on supply issues, but it did in an earlier report on the financing of housing supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.852.0/23">In conclusion, the Government need to look seriously at raising the supply of housing in the private rented sector. In doing so, they must ensure that we get not only additional supply but supply that is of good quality and at a reasonable rent. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about how he will achieve that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.855.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40338" speakername="Kris Hopkins" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government"  colnum="855"  time="018:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0003.htm#140304-0003.htm_spmin1">
	<p pid="a.855.0/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase> and to the Communities and Local Government Committee for securing this debate. I welcome this opportunity for the Government to set out what they are doing in relation to private rented supply. I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40174" name="Roberta Blackman-Woods">the hon. Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods)</phrase> that this has been an extremely interesting debate. The content was thoughtful and the tone, right across the House, was completely appropriate. I know that members of the Committee have spent a long time deliberating on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/2">We are pleased that the Select Committee produced this thoughtful and well-balanced report following its inquiry, and we agree with a considerable number of the recommendations. I am aware that there was a slight hint from some Members that we did not appreciate the work of the Committee, but let me say that I did appreciate the content of the report. I know that the Committee spent a long time taking evidence, and thinking about the report before reaching its conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/3">The Government recognise that the private rented sector is playing an increasingly important role in the housing market. There are now just short of 4 million households out there, accommodating some 8.5 million individuals. Moreover, there is, increasingly, a diverse range of people living in the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/4">Overall, the sector is performing well. As the hon. Member for Sheffield South East said, it is the one part of the market that grew even in the darkest times of the recession. Supply is now beginning to respond to the growth in demand. I recognise that many of the actions that I will talk about later on specifically relate to the Government&#8217;s intervention in increasing that supply.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/5">Rents are increasing more slowly than inflation. Let me say to the hon. Member for Islington North that I live on this planet, and that I cited a figure of 1.6%, not 1.4%. I recognise that the figures across London are higher, but overall, the Office for National Statistics is confident that the figure is 1.6%. Across the whole of England, the figure is 1%, which is significantly below inflation at this moment in time.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/6">Overall, the quality of private rented sector accommodation is improving and satisfaction levels are high. In fact, 83% of the people who live in the PRS say that the accommodation is good. The vast majority of people&#8212;some 80%&#8212;move from their own choice; some 10% move by agreement with their landlord and some 9% by the landlord&#8217;s activities or actions.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/7">We recognise that there are challenges that we need to address. For example, a lack of supply has led to a problem of affordability and a limited choice as a consequence, especially in hot spots around parts of London. The lack of professional landlords and the need to improve management practices in some parts of the sector are important. Legislation is in place&#8212;there is the Housing Act 2004&#8212;and we are taking action in certain areas. There is a need to change the balance. At the moment, some 78% of landlords are individuals who own one place, which they rent. We need to change that balance in favour of larger-scale providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/8">Tackling rogue landlords is an extremely important part of our work. I recognise the enormous amount that local councils do, and the Government have allocated &#163;6.5 million to addressing beds in sheds and poor-quality provision by enabling individuals to carry out not only raids and inspections but, importantly, prosecutions. There is growing demand for longer tenancies, especially among people with families, and we want to support them.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/9">The Government want a bigger and better PRS, which is why we want to make private renting more positive. Although we have heard negative comments in the debate, private renting is an extremely important part of the housing sector. As we heard, the PRS is now bigger than the social sector, so it is important that politicians, practitioners and professionals challenge the behaviour of the small minority of individuals who, owing to the poor-quality provision that their tenants receive, undermine not only the sector, but other people&#8217;s businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/10">Through the schemes that we have introduced, we are trying to bring new entrants into the sector and to attract more institutional investment. We want to drive forward more larger-scale, professionally managed, high-quality and well-designed accommodation. We want to stimulate the construction of more housing. We want to empower and inform tenants by driving up standards and promoting choice. We want to increase the effectiveness of existing regulation, but when supplementary regulation is needed, we should act judiciously so that we neither deter investment nor add costs, thus putting pressure on rents. While we want to crack down on rogue landlords, we do not want to put extra burdens on ordinary landlords who are providing a decent service.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/11">The Government have put forward the &#163;1 billion Build to Rent fund. Round 1 was over-subscribed, and three contracts have been signed, while further ones are going through due diligence. Round 2, on which an announcement will be made soon, was significantly over-subscribed, with 126 applications worth &#163;2.8 billion being received for a fund of only &#163;721 million. Our guarantee scheme, which is worth &#163;3.5 billion, will also secure new building in the sector. We want to introduce a redress scheme, a tenants charter and a model tenancy, as well as to crack down on the landlords I have mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/12">I want to talk about Members&#8217; contributions, and I must start with that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40700" name="Mike Kane">the hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Mike Kane)</phrase>. It is a convention in the House that one is gracious and welcoming to a new Member, regardless of our politics, and despite the fact that he is from Lancashire, I intend to comply with that protocol. He made a great speech. When I made my maiden speech only a few years ago, I was absolutely terrified, but he made a thoughtful speech and it was completely appropriate that he paid tribute to one of our former colleagues, Paul Goggins, who is greatly missed by Members on both sides of the House. I wish the hon. Gentleman a successful time representing the people of Wythenshawe and Sale East.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/13">We heard thoughtful contributions from Members on both sides of the House, and the hon. Member for Sheffield South East covered many points. I want to maintain a positive relationship with the Communities and Local Government Committee. I served on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, so I know the</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/14">immense work that a Committee does during its deliberations. The vast majority of the time, regardless of party, members of a Committee come together to discuss the issues thoughtfully, which is completely appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.855.0/15">This Government are absolutely committed to making sure that the private rented sector grows bigger and better&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="a.863.2/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As one Lancastrian to another, let me say that I am pleased to introduce this debate on access to new treatments for pancreatic cancer. It will become apparent why we are so pleased to get this debate at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.863.2/2">I want to start by reiterating some points I made about this dreadful disease in a debate in Westminster Hall last May that might help to set the context for this further debate today. Before I do, may I put on record my thanks to Pancreatic Cancer UK, Pancreatic Action, the all-party group on pancreatic cancer and others who have highlighted the impact of this disease? These include that great Lancastrian actress Julie Hesmondhalgh, who recently gave the disease some publicity in &#8220;Coronation Street&#8221;. More sadly there is the example of Kerry Harvey, who died at the age of 24 on <phrase class="date" code="2014-02-22">22 February</phrase> and did so much in her last months to highlight the impact of this disease with the assistance of Pancreatic Action.</p>
	<p pid="a.863.2/3">Pancreatic cancer is the fifth-most common cause of cancer death in the UK. Approximately 8,500 people will be newly diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year with around 7,900 people dying from the disease annually. Pancreatic cancer has the lowest survival rate of the 21 most common cancers. Five-year survival rates are less than 4%; a figure that has barely changed in nearly 40 years. Pancreatic cancer five-year survival rates lag behind many other EU countries and are almost half of what they are in the US, Canada and Australia. Only 1% of the National Cancer Research Institute Partners' total research spend is directed towards pancreatic cancer. By way of comparison, &#163;3,613 per death per year is spent on breast cancer research compared to &#163;553 per death per year on pancreatic cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.863.2/4">Some 50% of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed as a result of emergency admission; nearly twice that of other all other cancers combined. Patients diagnosed as a result of emergency admission, compared to other routes to diagnosis such as routine GP referral, have significantly lower rates of survival. Pancreatic cancer patients have one of the least satisfactory NHS experiences of all cancer patients, evidenced by National Cancer Patient experience surveys.</p>
	<p pid="a.863.2/5">If it is not too presumptuous, I would like to quote myself from the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2012-05-23">23 May 2012</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.863.2/6">&#8220;Effective cures for pancreatic cancer remain stubbornly elusive, but we need to try to find ways to prolong patients' lives and to ease their pain and sufferings while always remembering that, with cancer, it is not only the patient who is affected but the people around them, including their family.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2012-05-23.93"><i>Official Report, </i>23 May 2012; Vol. 545, c. 93WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.863.2/7">The all-party group then found out that a new drug, Abraxane, in combination with standard chemotherapy was licensed for use in patients in the UK and Ireland with metastatic pancreatic cancer. Abraxane has been described as the biggest advance in pancreatic cancer treatment in almost two decades; for a disease, as I have already said, where survival rates have barely changed in 40 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.863.2/8">As the drug has not yet been approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence it is not yet available on the NHS as a standard treatment. Pancreatic Cancer UK is very keen to ensure that patients are able to access Abraxane through the cancer drugs fund. The House will now see the importance of the debate tonight; the decision will be taken on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-06">Thursday 6 March</phrase>&#8212;that is this week. Along with others in the Chamber, I would like to see the drug approved by the CDF this week and then eventually by NICE so that access to it is more readily available. We know that Abraxane is due to be reviewed by NICE very soon but this process takes a great deal of time, and it is time that pancreatic cancer patients do not always have.</p>
	<p pid="a.863.2/9">One of my fears is based on my understanding of the way these new drugs are measured. This is based partly on what is called quality-adjusted life years which, so far as I understand it, is a measurement of the state of health and how long life is prolonged running from optimum health to death.</p>

	<p pid="a.864.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way and for bringing this important matter to the House&#8217;s attention. It is surprising how many of us know people, both personally and from our constituencies, who have been affected by pancreatic cancer. I have some figures from Northern Ireland that might help his argument. Only 14.2% of males and 10.3% of females live longer than a year after diagnosis. When we get to five years, those figures drop to 2.8% and 2.9% respectively. Early diagnosis is key, along with new treatments. That would increase the survival rate by 30%. Does he agree that a strategy covering all the regions of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland would be better for addressing the issue?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-03-04a.864.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40352" speakername="Eric Ollerenshaw" colnum="864"  time="019:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140304/debtext/140304-0004.htm#140304-0004.htm_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.864.1/1">The hon. Gentleman hits the nail on the head. It is of course a UK issue, and one of the concerns is the regional variation in performance on early diagnosis and the impact that is having. We want to get rid of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/2">I want to talk today about the new drug, Abraxane. The vast majority of pancreatic cancer patients are diagnosed so late that the benefit of any new drug can be measured only in months, rather than years. Our worry is that, compared with other cancers, that benefit might be deemed insufficient simply because it is measured in months and might not register highly on the quality-adjusted life years measurement scale.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/3">That is why Pancreatic Cancer UK launched its Two More Months campaign, which highlights what patients would have been able to do with two more months, which is the average additional survival time provided by Abraxane. I have a few quotes from relatives of those who have died from pancreatic cancer:</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/4">&#8220;Two more months would have been a significant amount of time for Nicola, only 25 years old herself, to spend with her four year old daughter&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/5">That was from Chris, Nicola&#8217;s brother.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/6">&#8220;Two more months would have meant my daughter Gemma might have got to wear her wedding dress and walk down the aisle with Adam&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/7">That was from Debbie, Gemma&#8217;s mum.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/8">&#8220;Two more months would have seen my wife Jill finish her Open University Modern Languages degree and attend an international social work conference in Buenos Aires, both of which she would have been very proud of&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/9">That was from Dave, Jill&#8217;s husband.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/10">&#8220;Two more months would have seen Andy and I celebrate our second wedding anniversary, and given us more time to prepare for what was to come&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="a.864.1/11">That was from Lynne.</p>

I know from my experience of working in the hospice movement that time is the thing that all patients want. If that drug can provide just a little more time, surely it is something that all those families should be given.</p>

	<p pid="a.865.3/1">I am grateful for those well-timed interventions from my colleagues across the frontier.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.3/2">What I am trying to get on the record is the fact that those two more months are critical in this particular cancer. Our worry is that two more months might not look good enough when the judgment is made, but for pancreatic cancer it is a massive improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.3/3">I also want to put on the record two other emerging possibilities. A useful and emerging new technology is NanoKnife. It carries out a process called irreversible electroporation, which destroys parts of the tumour while avoiding damage to vital tissue nearby, such as blood vessels. The process shrinks the tumour to a more manageable size, which might then allow more permanent surgical solutions. NanoKnife is currently available only through the private sector at one hospital in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.3/4">A company called Novartis, has a treatment for neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer that is currently funded via the CDF in England. Although it is welcome that patients can access treatment via that route, we continue to argue for a long-term solution. In that context, we are worried about Andrew Dillon&#8217;s statement that, under the new system of value assessments that NICE is due to introduce in the autumn, only six out of 20 treatments assessed by NICE in the past year would be approved. A 30% approval rate is clearly not the long-term solution expected from the original concept of value-based pricing. In 2013, I understand, not one new cancer drug was approved by NICE. That issue, perhaps, is for a wider debate, but I hope the Minister understands that those arguing on behalf of pancreatic cancer patients are extremely worried about ever getting the new drugs on to the system and available for wider use across, hopefully, the whole United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.865.3/5">Minister, this debate has been an unashamed appeal for support&#8212;from the charities concerned, the all-party group, the survivors and all those who have been affected by pancreatic cancer through the loved ones they have lost. We do not want others to go through our tragic experiences.</p>

	<p pid="a.866.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on securing this debate. I should like to pick up on what he said about NanoKnife&#8212;there is also CyberKnife and Gamma Knife. Those are all modern, stereotactic treatments for cancer. I hope that he agrees that we need to concentrate not just on the drugs but on those particular types of radiosurgery, which can make sure that people live longer if they are given the trials that they need.</p>

	<p pid="a.866.1/1">The hon. Lady makes an important point. Our point is that because of the poor pancreatic cancer survival rates and its late diagnosis, which is the key, it always seems that the pancreatic cancer patient is last in the queue. The quality of life assessments do not look long enough to justify a new drug or new radiotherapy, as has been pointed out.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.1/2">Again, I pay tribute to Pancreatic Cancer Action, which got a great deal of press from an advert, not used at the time, saying, &#8220;I wish I had breast cancer&#8221;. That was effective in raising publicity about the impact of pancreatic cancer.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.1/3">I am trying to put whatever pressure the Chamber is capable of exerting on the cancer drugs fund when it makes its decision on Thursday and on NICE for what it does to follow. Providing Abraxane and an extra two months could help ease this year&#8217;s 8,500 tragedies and start the process of making up for 40 years of lost hope.</p>

	<p pid="a.866.2/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40352" name="Eric Ollerenshaw">the hon. Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Eric Ollerenshaw)</phrase> on securing this debate and setting the scene so well. Pancreatic cancer needs all our efforts if we are to make a difference. I pay tribute to pancreatic cancer patients up and down the land, including my good friend Sir John Mason, who is battling the disease, and all the families and friends of those with pancreatic cancer, as well as those working with and supporting them.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.2/2">As the hon. Gentleman said, survival rates from the disease have not changed for 40 years. Abraxane gives the opportunity not only for two more months, but to bring about change and transform how the disease is dealt with in future. In the United States, there is already innovation in how the disease is being tackled. I hope that the people having to make these difficult decisions listen to this debate and take it into account when making the decisions in a proper and objective way. It is important that our voices echo those of people who are contacting us about the condition, including my constituent, Maggie Watts, who has assembled a petition of 45,117 names of people who are shouting for something to be done about this disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.2/3">That is all I want to say; I wanted to add my support to that of my hon. Friend the Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood with whom I have worked on the all-party parliamentary group on pancreatic cancer.</p>

	<p pid="a.866.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40352" name="Eric Ollerenshaw">the Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Eric Ollerenshaw)</phrase> on securing this debate and leading it in the knowledgeable and able way that he has led other debates on this</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/2">important subject. I will do my best to respond to his specific points, but there may be some that I will need to respond to after the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/3">It goes without saying that cancer is a terrible disease, and my hon. Friend spoke movingly of his experience, but all hon. Members know ways in which it has touched them and their families and friends. I pay tribute to the work that he and colleagues in the all-party parliamentary group on pancreatic cancer have done to raise awareness of the disease. Its excellent report, &#8220;Time to Change the Story&#8221;, does much to counter common misconceptions about the disease.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/4">My hon. Friend drew the House&#8217;s attention again to the particularly poor outcome for people who get the disease and the challenges in diagnosis. If we could match the best survival rates in Europe we could save an additional 75 lives a year. Clearly, if we exceeded those survival rates, more people would be saved.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/5">Before I tackle my hon. Friend&#8217;s specific point about Abraxane, it is worth giving the context of other work that the Government are doing to support earlier diagnosis. We committed more than &#163;450 million in funding over the four years to 2014-15. Sadly, there is currently no easy way of detecting pancreatic cancer and it can be particularly difficult for GPs to detect and diagnose it, especially in its early stages. However, to try to address the situation, the Department helped to fund a six-month pilot with Macmillan Cancer Support of a cancer decision support tool for GPs to help them to identify patients whom they might not otherwise refer urgently for this suspected cancer. Evaluation of the pilot is under way, and if it is found to be helpful, we will work with NHS England actively to promote its use. That tool was highlighted at a recent parliamentary event that some hon. Members might have attended.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/6">We need to do more about earlier diagnosis and public awareness of the symptoms, which are often limited. As is often the way, I suspect that the recent &#8220;Coronation Street&#8221; story line has done more than many public health campaigns could have done to raise awareness. Yet again, well done to our broadcasters for covering some difficult issues and providing through Hayley&#8217;s sad story some important health education. It has reached many people, and we thank them for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/7">On Abraxane, I am obviously aware of Pancreatic Cancer UK&#8217;s Two More Months campaign, and I congratulate my hon. Friend on this particularly well-timed debate. I am fully sympathetic to his points. As he says, two more months can mean so much to those who are affected by this cancer, and he gave some moving examples. We do not associate the disease with younger people. Sufferers are predominantly older but, as he illustrated, many people suffer at a younger age. I thank those who contributed to the report details of loved ones they have lost. My hon. Friend bears witness to his own loss, which we feel keenly with him.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/8">I listened to my hon. Friend&#8217;s request that the recently licensed drug, Abraxane, should be made available from the cancer drugs fund. As he says, in the light of new evidence from the manufacturer, NHS England&#8217;s cancer drugs fund expert clinical panel is reviewing its earlier decision not to add it to its national list. One criterion in the scoring tool used by the panel is evidence of a drug&#8217;s impact on quality of life, which is what my hon. Friend</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/9">spoke about. While I cannot in any way pre-empt the panel&#8217;s decision, I can fully understand how important this will be to people with pancreatic cancer. I will ensure that NHS England is made aware of tonight&#8217;s debate and the very good attendance. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40520" name="Nicholas Dakin">the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin)</phrase> said, that reflects the impatience of parliamentarians, on behalf of their constituents, to see progress on this issue, which we seem to have been stuck on for so long. I undertake to do that immediately in the morning to ensure that the information is with the panel ahead of its deliberations.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/10">My hon. Friend will be aware that Abraxane has not yet been assessed by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Partly because of these situations, we established the cancer drugs fund to ensure that cancer patients in England have better access to life-extending or life-improving drugs that are not routinely funded by the NHS. He may also be aware that Novartis&#8217;s drug Afinitor is included on the national list for the cancer drugs fund, alongside two other treatments for treating pancreatic and neuro-endocrine carcinomas. More than 44,000 patients have benefited from the cancer drugs fund since October 2010, and we have recently announced an extension to funding for the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/11">Looking further ahead, NICE is appraising Abraxane for untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer and expects to publish its guidance to the NHS in January 2015. That may seem a long way away, but, as been mentioned, this reflects the robust, evidence-based technology appraisal programme that NICE provides to ensure that clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is taken into account when we look at drugs and treatments. The Government believe that clinically appropriate drugs should be routinely available to NHS patients, and we remain committed to the rapid uptake of NICE-recommended drugs in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.866.3/12">My hon. Friend referred to recent decisions on cancer drugs made by NICE. I am sure he appreciates that there will naturally be fluctuations in the proportions of drugs recommended by NICE each year, and so a more accurate picture can be gained from looking at all NICE decisions on cancer drugs to date. That shows that almost two thirds of its decisions on cancer drugs have recommended their use for all or some of the eligible patient population. Far from making appraisals tougher, the most significant change to NICE technology appraisal methods in recent years has been to introduce greater flexibility in the appraisal of potentially life-extending treatments for patients at the end of their lives, and that has helped NICE to recommend a number of new cancer drugs for use on the NHS. That speaks directly to the extremely pertinent points that my hon. Friend made about how someone who has had such a diagnosis will see an extra two months in the context of the end of life, given that the progress of the disease can be very rapid from the point of certain diagnosis.</p>

	<p pid="a.869.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has made that point in other contexts before, and it is a perfectly good one. Of course, health is a devolved matter, but as regards research and what we know about drugs, there are lots of aspects on which England has taken a lead and on which the devolved Administrations co-operate. I regularly have exchanges of letters with my opposite numbers. When there are important lessons to be learned on behalf of all our constituents, we would naturally share that information and expect it to be looked at in all parts of our United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.0/2">Our priority is to make sure that we get the best possible results for all NHS patients with the resources we have. That is why we have asked NICE to look at how drugs are assessed to ensure that patients can get the treatments they need at the best value for the NHS, and that the price the NHS pays is more closely linked to the value a medicine brings. These can sometimes sound like quite cold decisions, but they are designed to help us to have a sense of objectivity in what are always very difficult decision-making processes. I assure my hon. Friend that NICE will carry out a full public consultation before implementing any changes in the way that it makes these assessments.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.0/3">My hon. Friend referred to NanoKnife, which was also mentioned in an intervention. I am advised, I am afraid, that NICE has published guidance on that procedure which states that current evidence on the safety and efficacy of irreversible electroporation for treating pancreatic cancer is inadequate in quantity and quality, and it recommends that the procedure should currently be used only in the context of research.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.0/4">My hon. Friend mentioned research funding. We are often asked about the amount of funding put into one area or another and I always like to make the point that, rather than specifying subject areas, the National Institute for Health Research welcomes funding applications for research into any aspect of human health. These applications are subject to peer review and are judged in open competition, with awards made on the basis of the importance of the topic to patients and the NHS, value for money and scientific quality.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.0/5">I have no idea whether parliamentary interest is part of that mix, but I cannot believe that it hurts at all. Such issues come up regularly, and whenever I meet people from different health institutions and the NHS I always make a point about the things in which Parliament has shown a particularly keen interest to debate and progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.869.2/1">I do not think I have time, sadly, but I would be happy to speak to my hon. Friend after the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.2/2">I hope it will be of interest that the Government are investing a record &#163;800 million over five years in a series of biomedical research centres and units, including &#163;6.5 million of funding for the Liverpool biomedical research unit in gastrointestinal disease, which has a major focus on pancreatic cancer. Some really interesting things are coming out of the opportunities for biomedical centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.2/3">Recruitment to studies associated with pancreatic cancer by the NIHR clinical research network has also increased more than fivefold, from 447 in 2008-09 to 2,744 in 2012-13, which is another measure of the increased emphasis and interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.869.2/4">I again pay tribute to my hon.

	<p pid="a.870.1/1">I will, if I may, take my hon. Friend&#8217;s question away and respond to it formally. Obviously, it is a matter for NICE and I will make sure that I get an answer for her.
