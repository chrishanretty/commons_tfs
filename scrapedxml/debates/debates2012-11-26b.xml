The extra cadet units will be formed through partnerships with existing units, or by self-standing new units, both using third-party sponsorship funding. The departments have identified &#163;10.85 million to meet the programme&#8217;s training and equipment costs. More than 50 schools have already registered their interest, and the joint departmental team, supported by the reserve forces and cadets associations, will work with schools to develop the most appropriate cadet option for them.</p>

Activities such as those offered by the cadets and inviting armed service leaders into the classroom help to instil qualities such as confidence, self-discipline and responsibility, while developing team work and leadership skills. Experience from the military and education sectors has demonstrated how those core values can help pupils reach their academic potential and become well rounded and accomplished adults, fully prepared for life beyond school. The Government very much encourage the movement, and I am grateful that my hon. Friend gives it her personal support.</p>

Is a core problem the way in which the BTEC in uniformed public services counts towards the evaluation of state-funded schools more generally? I know the Education Secretary is aware of that problem, and it will have to be overcome if cadet forces are to flourish in state schools.</p>

I take on board the point about the BTEC. I recently met Lord Hill, the Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Education, to discuss how we can further increase the cadet movement in schools, and when we next meet I will ensure the issue is on the agenda. It would be helpful if the right hon.

	<p pid="b.3.7/1">The UK and the international community are committed to Afghanistan for the long term. As part of our enduring legacy in Afghanistan, UK troops will support the continuing development of the Afghan national security forces by mentoring trainers at the Afghan national army officer academy. In addition, it is likely that some troops will remain in a non-combat role after the end of 2014 to complete the recovery of our equipment. Beyond that, no decisions have yet been made about any longer-term UK mission in Afghanistan, but detailed planning with NATO and other allies is ongoing. We are clear, however, that we will not be involved in a combat role after <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-31">31 December 2014</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.5/1">I am happy to join the right hon. Gentleman in congratulating 12 Mechanized Brigade on the considerable advances that have been made over the past six months. For all that we read in the media, and for all the siren voices attempting to tell us something different, the evidence on the ground is that steady progress is being made. Incidents of violence continue but are increasingly outside the population centres, and life in much of Helmand is increasingly returning to normal, with bazaars reopening, schools operating and health centres being constructed. Of course, the current spate of green on blue attacks has a significant impact, but I am confident that we will not allow it to deter us from our mission.</p>

As we in this country know perhaps more than anyone else in the world, reconciliation in war-torn, strife-torn countries invariably</p>

As we go through the cycle of transition, we will expect there to be mentoring and assistance at increasingly higher levels of command.

	<p pid="b.8.1/1">The shadow Secretary of State is well aware that under EU procurement rules any nation can direct warlike stores, such as large warships, to be built within its national boundaries. That would mean that in the very unlikely event of a Scottish independence vote leading to an independent Scotland, a new Scottish Government could place orders for Scottish warships to be built in Scottish yards, whereas the residual UK Government could direct warships to be built in their own yards, if they decided to take advantage of the EU exemption. As far as Portsmouth is concerned, the terms of business agreement entered into by the previous Government left the decisions about how the company should rationalise the ship building programme for another day. Having placed large orders that would run beyond the general election, they were not prepared to take tough decisions on what should happen to consolidate the industry.</p>

I am very pleased that we did so, as we have been forced, because of the deficit we inherited, to make fairly substantial cuts to the defence budget and it would have been perverse to vote through an increase in the EDA budget. It is absolutely crucial that the EDA takes every opportunity to ensure that it extracts efficiencies from its programmes, and it will have our support in levering in effect, but the emphasis must be on effect and capability, not institution building.</p>

	<p pid="b.10.5/1">Combat immunity is an important legal principle that the MOD is committed to defend. The courts have consistently held that a soldier involved in combat or under an immediate threat should be able to focus on the task of fighting. Constant assessment of personal liability on the battlefield could lead to paralysis across the chain of command and result in military failure and increased loss of life through operational inefficiency. Imposing a duty of care in those circumstances is not appropriate and would reduce operational effectiveness. However, there is a recognised mechanism to compensate for injury or death under existing statutory schemes.</p>

Given that the clear consequences of that ruling are that the MOD owes a duty of care properly to equip its troops when they go into battle, does the Minister agree that an urgent review of procurement and training&#8212;never mind statutory schemes&#8212;is needed in the interests of the safety and morale of our armed forces?</p>

We expect that by mid-2013 all parts of the country will have entered the process and that Afghan security forces will be in the lead for security nationwide.

The concerns raised by the industry about exactly how a Government-owned, contractor operated model would work therefore need to be taken seriously. The Minister&#8217;s predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40399" name="Peter Luff">the hon.

I am a member of the Scottish Affairs Committee and our inquiry, although not yet complete, would seem to suggest that the contribution is immense and the implications of separation would be devastating.

I was in Essex when Harlow, among others, signed the community covenant. It is wonderful that more than 200 local authorities across the United Kingdom have signed the community covenant, which helps to give effect to the armed forces covenant at local government level. I recently wrote a joint letter with Sir Merrick Cockell, chairman of the Local Government Association, congratulating those councils that have signed the community covenant and gently urging those that have not to do so.

	<p pid="b.21.1/1">I would like the House of Commons to be the first to know about the future leadership of the Bank of England, and the identity of its next Governor.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/2">Sir Mervyn King has served as Governor with great distinction and unquestioned integrity for almost a decade, five years of which have been during the most difficult period of economic policy making of the modern age. He will continue to do his vital work until <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-30">30 June</phrase> next year, and there will be opportunities then to thank him for his service to our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/3">Today&#8217;s task is to appoint his successor in good time and in good order. We have, for the first time in the history of the Bank, advertised the post, invited applications and put together an experienced panel to interview potential candidates. I want to thank my permanent secretary, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, and the chairman of the court of the Bank of England, Sir David Lees, for conducting this new, open process in a very professional way.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/4">I also want to thank the many individuals who put themselves forward for the job. I have myself interviewed in London all the very distinguished candidates shortlisted by the panel for the job, any one of whom would have made a good Governor. I have made my recommendation to the Prime Minister, who in turn has made the same recommendation to the Queen, and she has today approved the appointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/5">I can tell Parliament and the public that the next Governor of the Bank of England is to be Mark Carney. He is currently Governor of the central Bank of Canada and chair of the world&#8217;s Financial Stability Board. He is quite simply the best, most experienced and most qualified person in the world to be the next Governor of the Bank of England and to help steer Britain&#8217;s families and businesses through these difficult economic times.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/6">Britain needs the very best at a time like this, and in Mark Carney we have got him. Mr Carney is unique among the potential candidates in combining long experience of central banking, huge international credibility in economics, deep expertise in financial regulation and first-hand experience of private sector financial institutions. He is acknowledged as the outstanding central banker of his generation, and I believe he will bring the strong leadership and external experience that the Bank of England needs as it takes on its heavy new responsibilities for regulating our banking system.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/7">In that respect, Mr Carney will bring a fresh new perspective. During his five years as the Bank of Canada Governor, Canada was acknowledged to have weathered the economic storm better than any other major western economy. Bank bail-outs have been avoided and sustained growth has returned, and it says something of Mark Carney&#8217;s abilities and the regard he is held in that he was chosen by his fellow central bank governors and regulators around the world to be the chair of the FSB&#8212;the body tasked with strengthening and co-ordinating global financial regulation. That gives him the experience to bring better regulation to the world&#8217;s largest global financial centre here in London and other financial centres across the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/8">Subject to the views of other members of the board, he could expect to remain chair of the FSB until 2018. While the appointment as Governor will be for eight years, Mark Carney has indicated that he intends to serve for five years and to stand down at the end of June 2018. That will align with the timing of his role at the FSB, and reflects the fact that by then he will have served for 10 years as a central bank governor. I have spoken to my opposite number in Canada, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, and the Prime Minister has spoken to the Canadian Prime Minister. As I am grateful for the constructive way they have handled this transition, as Members would expect from one of our closest friends and allies.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/9">Mark Carney will continue as Central Bank Governor of Canada until the end of May next year. My statement today is matched by a simultaneous announcement in Ottawa at a press conference currently being held by Mr Carney and the Canadian Finance Minister. Mr Carney will be answering questions about his decision to take this new job, but he has made it clear that he will not be commenting at length on British economic policy until he takes up his new post on <phrase class="date" code="2013-07-01">1 July 2013</phrase>. There is one exception to that: Mr Carney has said to me that he would like to appear before the Treasury Select Committee at a mutually convenient time for a pre-commencement hearing, where he will of course expect rigorous questioning about British monetary and financial policy. This will be the first time ever that a new Governor has appeared before a Committee of this House before their term of office begins.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/10">Mr Carney&#8217;s pay and benefits are a matter for the non-executive members of the court of the Bank of England. The chair of the court, Sir David Lees, has today confirmed that Mr Carney will be paid a total pay and pension package that is broadly equivalent to the current Governor&#8217;s salary and membership of the now closed pension scheme available to the current Governor and deputy governors. The package is also lower than that of other senior regulators, such as the recent chief executive of the Financial Services Authority&#8212;even though the Bank now takes on many of that organisation&#8217;s responsibilities&#8212;and is less than that of the current chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority. As Mr Carney is moving from Canada with his wife and four children, the non-executive members of the court of the Bank of England have said that they will consider in addition a relocation and accommodation package, which one would expect with such moves.</p>
	<p pid="b.21.1/11">Mark Carney is not a British citizen, but he is a subject of the Queen. His wife is British, his four children have dual British citizenship and he has lived, worked and studied in Britain for a decade. Although not required of the role, he will apply for British citizenship in the normal way, with no special favours. Let me also say something about&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.22.1/1">Let me also say something about the deputy governor for monetary stability, Dr Charlie Bean, whose term in office expires at the same time as Mervyn</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/2">King&#8217;s. Charlie Bean is a world-class macro-economist and a powerful voice on the Monetary Policy Committee. To ensure a smooth transition next year, he has agreed to my request that he serve for one more year as deputy governor. I am most grateful to Charlie Bean for his continuing service.</p>
	<p pid="b.22.1/3">The role that the Bank of England plays in our economy cannot be overestimated. It is tasked with keeping prices under control; it sets interest rates, which affect what home owners pay for their mortgages and businesses for their loans; and, following this Government&#8217;s reforms, it plays a lead role in keeping our banking system safe. My job brings with it many responsibilities, but few are greater than ensuring that the next Governor of the Bank of England is a person of real quality. Mark Carney is a quality Governor. He is the outstanding central banker of his generation, with unparalleled expertise in financial regulation. He will bring a fresh perspective. He has got what it takes to help British families and businesses through these incredibly challenging economic times. My responsibility was to get the best for Britain, and with Mark Carney we have got that. I commend his appointment to the House and to the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.23.0/1">I thank the Chancellor of the Exchequer for advance notice of today&#8217;s statement&#8212;although not of its content. I join him in thanking the outgoing Governor of the Bank of England, Sir Mervyn King, for his public service and I wish him a long and happy retirement. I commend the Chancellor on his choice of successor, Mr Mark Carney, to be the third Governor of the Bank of England since our decision to make it independent in 1997. We on this side of the House look forward to working with him closely in the coming months and years.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/2">I have known Mark Carney for a number of years and have worked with him closely. He has a long and distinguished record of public service, great financial expertise and a track record of handling tough and complex challenges. He follows in a tradition established in 1997 when the first appointments to the Monetary Policy Committee included Willem Buiter and DeAnne Julius, neither of whom were British citizens at the time. In my view Mark Carney is a good choice and a good judgment, and his experience will be invaluable.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/3">The Chancellor has made a short statement today, but this is a decision of great significance. With the leave of the House, I would like to ask a number of questions of the Chancellor concerning Mr Carney&#8217;s appointment and the role that the new Governor will step into.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/4">At a time of economic stress, the new Governor will need to get to grips with a new and massively enlarged central bank that has new, onerous and complex responsibilities in prudential and consumer regulation as well as its role in monetary policy and financial stability. That is a near impossible job for one person, but in our view it is made harder by the way in which the Chancellor has drawn up the Financial Services Bill, which is still being considered in the other place. We remain disappointed that he is continuing to resist the amendments tabled by the Chair of the Treasury Select Committee and ourselves that would enable the complex</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/5">new arrangements for the Bank of England to be properly scrutinised. In our view, the new Governor would be strengthened and enhanced, not weakened, by greater transparency. Will the Chancellor think again about that matter?</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/6">The Chancellor also needs to clear up the deep confusion at the heart of the new arrangements about who is responsible in a crisis, which he has not managed to clear up to our satisfaction under the current Governor. The Bill heaps far too much power on the new Governor, who, when dealing with the Chancellor, will be able to internalise and suppress the inevitable conflicts within the Bank of England between financial stability on the one hand and monetary stability, fiscal risk and moral hazard on the other. It makes no sense that the deputy governors, including the deputy governor who heads prudential stability, will have no undisputed right to put their views directly to the Chancellor, whether or not the Governor agrees. That is neither stable nor sensible. There is obfuscation in the Bill, and it is not good enough simply to have a memorandum of understanding with ad hoc committees. If the new Governor is to have a fair chance of success, the flaws in accountability and crisis management must be resolved. Will the Chancellor agree to sit down with the new Governor and sort this out?</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/7">The new Governor of the Bank of England also looks set to inherit a difficult external economic environment, a global economy that still has serious imbalances, the eurozone in continuing crisis, and here in the UK, challenges to our banking system, to growth and to fiscal policy. So let me ask the Chancellor a further question about the relationship between the Treasury and the Bank of England that the new Governor will inherit.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/8">Given the blurring of the relationship between monetary and fiscal policy following the recent decision to transfer &#163;35 billion from the Bank of England&#8217;s quantitative easing programme to the Treasury coffers&#8212;a move that is set to reduce short-term Government borrowing and increase the longer-term burden on the taxpayer&#8212;I very much hope that the new Governor and the Chancellor will agree with the Institute for Fiscal Studies, which has stated today that they should</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/9">&#8220;exclude the impact of this change from all figures when assessing compliance with the fiscal targets&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/10">Is that a matter that the Chancellor has discussed with the present Governor, the new Governor, the Office for Budget Responsibility or the Office for National Statistics? Can he reassure us that the IFS&#8217;s recommendations will be taken on board?</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/11">Writing in the<i> Financial Times</i> earlier this year, I began an article by saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/12">&#8220;Wanted, a new governor of the Bank of England. Only superhumans need apply.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.23.0/13">Superhuman or not, the new Governor of the Bank of England, Mr Mark Carney, is well qualified to take on the role at what will be a very difficult time. I am sure that I speak for the whole House when I say that we wish him and his family well.</p>

	<p pid="b.24.0/1">Given the many fierce exchanges that the shadow Chancellor and I have across the Dispatch Box, it is only right for me to acknowledge my real gratitude to him today for welcoming this appointment.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/2">He knows Mark Carney, and he knows that he is an outstanding candidate for the job. I shall certainly cherish the words &#8220;I commend the Chancellor&#8221;, because I will probably never hear them from the right hon. Gentleman again. I sincerely thank him for that.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/3">One of the important things about the independence of the Bank of England, which the right hon. Gentleman helped to establish with the previous Prime Minister, is that it commands cross-party support&#8212;it did not at the time; it does now&#8212;and we must try to keep the appointment of the Governor out of the day-to-day partisan debate. The right hon. Gentleman has certainly played his role in doing that today. Let me answer specifically his questions about the new role of the Bank of England.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/4">First, on the shadow Chancellor&#8217;s point about the new responsibilities, the Bank has heavy new responsibilities because, in our judgment, the tripartite system did not work and was not properly co-ordinated. Indeed, the Select Committee of the last Parliament, which was chaired by Lord McFall&#8212;John McFall as he was then&#8212;said that it was not clear who was in charge. By insisting that the Bank of England is in charge of macro-prudential and micro-prudential regulation, we bring those things together.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/5">It is also important, secondly, that we recognise that the Government have an important role. When there is a material risk to public funds, there is a clear responsibility in the Bill for the Bank of England to inform the Treasury, without deluging it on a day-to-day basis with everything that is happening and not differentiating the things that are significant and really important. We have taken in the Bill the power of direction that did not previously exist. In the memoirs of my predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>, he made it clear that at one point he was considering using the almost nuclear power of direction in the Bank of England Act 1946, which no one had ever used, but that he backed away from it because he did not have a more targeted instrument. We now have that targeted power of direction, which the elected Government can use.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/6">Thirdly, we have discussed the role of the deputy governors. Although it is incumbent on any good Governor and any good Chancellor of the Exchequer to try to make sure that views are heard, ultimately the Bank has to reconcile its internal differences rather than, as I have said, allowing the internal differences to be expressed externally without any attempt to resolve them internally. I make it my business in doing my job to see the deputy governors and to make sure that their views are heard.</p>
	<p pid="b.24.0/7">Finally, let me deal with the asset purchase facility coupons. This was done with the support and acceptance of the Governor of the Bank of England and the Monetary Policy Committee, which discussed it and agreed that that was a more transparent way of accounting for the quantitative easing coupons and how they will affect the public finances through the coming years. I can confirm for the right hon. Gentleman that when the Office for Budget Responsibility produces its report next week for the autumn statement, it will clearly show the impact of the APF coupons on the public finances, both before and after.</p>

	<p pid="b.25.0/1">May I begin by thanking Mervyn King for his outstanding public service and hard work through the appalling financial crisis</p>
	<p pid="b.25.0/2">with which he has had to grapple? I support what appears to be the appointment of an extremely talented and experienced Governor, who has already been welcomed on both sides of the House. I welcome the fact that the Chancellor has come out in support of the Treasury Select Committee&#8217;s holding a hearing prior to the appointment of the new Governor and of the reporting of its conclusions to the whole House. Does the Chancellor agree that the legitimacy of the appointment would be further bolstered by giving the House an opportunity to debate that appointment in the light of our findings?</p>

	<p pid="b.26.0/1">These days, of course, the House of Commons can choose what it wants to debate through the Backbench Business Committee, while the Opposition are always able to table motions, too. I do not think it would be sensible to try to divide the House on something like the appointment of the Governor of the Bank of England. One of the advantages of the Bank of England, as I was saying to the shadow Chancellor, is that there is an agreement that it should be kept out of party politics and the like; we have achieved that today. Mr Carney said clearly in my discussions with him that he did not want to talk about British economic policy at any great length at his press conference today or, indeed, while he continues as the Governor of the Bank of Canada, but that he did want to talk at length to my hon. Friend&#8217;s Committee. At a mutually convenient time, he will do that.</p>

	<p pid="b.26.2/2">Mark Carney will apply for British citizenship, but he is absolutely clear that he should do so in the normal way&#8212;the same way in which anyone else would apply for it. One thing that I have learned from the last Government is that Ministers of the Crown should be very careful about becoming involved in citizenship decisions.</p>

	<p pid="b.27.1/1">There should not be any conflicts of interest, because he is very clearly the Governor of the central Bank of Canada, will remain so until the end of May, and will fight Canada&#8217;s corner as we would expect him to do. However, he is also the chair of the Financial Stability Board, of which we are a member. He is already heavily involved in international financial regulation and in decisions that have a real impact on our financial services. Moreover, Canada is a G7 country, and is probably one of our closest allies: it is difficult to think of a closer ally than Canada. We already work incredibly closely with the Canadians. Incidentally, the fact that we co-ordinated the press conference in Ottawa and the statement in the House of Commons today and the news did not leak in advance shows that the two Governments work together and trust each other.</p>

Although he will not take up his position until next summer, no doubt his views will be keenly studied in expectation of his doing so. Does the Chancellor agree that one thing that all our constituents will want to hear from him is a clear indication that he will expect the very highest professional standards in the banking industry, so that bankers can be seen to be working in favour of taxpayers and consumers and not just with self-regard?</p>

	<p pid="b.27.3/1">Mr Carney has been pretty tough in Canada, and Canada has a much better record than this country of avoiding bail-outs and keeping Canadian banks safe. As chair of the Financial Stability Board, he has been very keen to secure international agreement on new, tougher rules on pay, risk-taking and the like in order to ensure that individual financial centres do not try to out-compete each other for less and less regulation. I should also make clear that he supports the John Vickers reforms that we will be introduced in the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill, including the ring-fencing of retail banking, which is the really major reform of banking that the coalition Government are bringing about.</p>

	<p pid="b.28.3/1">The one thing that we have learned is that regulation of banks and managing of demand in our economy cannot be separated; they are part of a continuum and that is one of the things that went wrong. Of course the Bank of England takes on heavy responsibilities, and the new Governor will have to manage the Bank in a very effective way to manage those new responsibilities. Mervyn King has already said that there needs to be a chief operating officer in the Bank, and there will be three deputy governors: for macro-prudential, micro-prudential and monetary policy. They too need to shoulder the burden, as indeed they currently do.</p>

The Bank of England has created the funding for lending scheme, and we see the impact of that in new products that banks such as Santander and Lloyds have launched.

We appointed John Vickers and his very experienced commission to do the job, and they looked explicitly at ring-fencing and came forward with their proposal. That proposal has now been discussed in this Chamber and commands consensus across the system. If we were suddenly to back away from it now and say that we wanted to start all over again with some other approach, that would delay everything.

	<p pid="b.33.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the European Union Council last week.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/2">Last week&#8217;s Council was unable to reach agreement on a seven-year budget framework. This Government rejected a proposal that would have risked UK taxpayers paying for unaffordable increases in the EU&#8217;s annual budgets. We did so together with like-minded allies from a number of countries. As net contributors to the EU, those countries, like Britain, write the cheques and together we had a very clear message: we are not going to be tough on budgets at home and then sign up to big increases in European spending in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/3">Let me explain to the House the proposal we rejected, why a deal is still doable, why it is still in our interests to work to achieve that deal and why throughout these negotiations I will continue to protect the UK&#8217;s rebate. Our objective for EU spending in the seven years to 2020 is clear: we want to see spending reduced and will insist on at least a real-terms freeze. As the House knows, the actual EU budget is negotiated annually. What we were negotiating in Brussels last week, and will return to again next year, is the overall framework for the next seven years, which includes the overall ceilings on what can be spent. During the last negotiation, which covered the period 2007 to 2013, the last Government increased the payments ceiling by 8%. The commitments ceiling was effectively set at &#8364;994 billion, well above the level of actual spending. It was a bit like having a credit card limit far above what one can afford and it was an open invitation to the EU&#8217;s big spenders to push for higher and higher spending every year. We are still paying the price for that decision.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/4">This year, 2013, the Commission and the European Parliament are attempting to grow the annual budget by another 6.8%. I am determined to get the ceilings down in line with what we can afford. Prior to the Council, the Commission produced a ludicrous proposal to increase the commitments ceiling still further to more than &#8364;1 trillion. We said no. The Cypriot presidency produced a slightly lower total, and going into this Council, the President of the Council, Herman Van Rompuy, produced a new proposal, this time with a ceiling of &#8364;973 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/5">As you can see, Mr Speaker, we were making progress in getting the ceilings down, but as I and other leaders made clear, it was not enough. We set out a number of very reasonable ways in which the seven-year ceiling could be reduced even further, by tens of billions more. What was disappointing at the Council was that having heard those proposals, the presidency offered a new proposal that failed to reduce significantly the previous total and simply redistributed money to buy off different countries. In a seven-year budget of almost &#8364;1 trillion, the idea that there are no real savings to be found is simply not credible. For example, when it came to the bureaucratic costs of the European Commission, not a single euro in administrative savings was offered&#8212;not one euro. We need to cut unaffordable spending. The deal on the table was not good enough and that is why we and others rejected it.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/6">But we do believe that a deal is still doable. There is absolutely no reason why we should not be able to reduce the seven-year ceilings down to the level needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/7">There is plenty of scope for significant savings in the common agricultural policy and the structural and cohesion funds, but there are also savings to be had in the rest of the budget. For example, freezing the ceilings for security, justice and external spending would allow &#8364;7.5 billion of additional savings. There are some programmes, such as Connecting Europe, which have enormous proposed increases in their budgets that could be radically scaled back.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/8">As I have said before, there is simply no excuse for not taking a much tougher approach towards the EU&#8217;s administrative costs. The EU institutions have simply got to adjust to the real world. A 10% cut in the overall pay bill would save almost &#8364;3 billion. Relaxing the rules on automatic promotion, which they have at the EU Commission, would save &#8364;1.5 billion. Reducing the extraordinary generosity of the special tax rules for Brussels staff&#8212;the levy&#8212;could save around another &#8364;1 billion, and changes to pension rights could save another &#8364;1.5 billion. All these are perfectly reasonable proposals. That is why a deal is still doable. We will push hard for these reductions when negotiations resume next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/9">Let me briefly be clear about why we want a deal. If no deal is reached, the existing ceilings are simply rolled over and annual budgets are negotiated on a year-by year-basis, taking account of those ceilings. Crucially, we would not get the reduction we need in the seven-year budget ceilings negotiated by the last Government. The credit card limit would stay beyond what is affordable, tens of billions of euros higher even than the deal we rejected at this Council. It is therefore in our interests to get a deal, but it must not come at any cost. We must not lock in unaffordable ceilings for the next seven years, so if necessary, we may have to galvanise a coalition of like-minded countries to deliver budgetary restraint through annual budget negotiations each year.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/10">Finally, let me say a word about the UK&#8217;s rebate. As well as ensuring fairness in terms of the overall size of the EU budget, it is also essential to ensure fairness in the net contribution that each country makes to that budget. At this Council, we faced, as ever, determined pressure from many sides for our rebate to be slashed. The changes on the table, in the proposal in front of us, would have cost the UK more than &#8364;1 billion every year. I was clear that all of that was completely unacceptable. Britain more than pays its way in Europe. On a per capita basis, Britain is the eleventh richest nation, yet as a share of our national income we are the third largest contributor, and that is with the rebate&#8212;or what remains of it after so much was given away by the last Government. Without the rebate, we would have the largest contribution in the European Union, double that of France and almost one and a half times as large as Italy&#8217;s or Germany&#8217;s. That would be completely unfair. It is why Margaret Thatcher was right to fight so hard to win the British rebate, why the last Labour Government did this country such a disservice by agreeing to give part of it away and why no Government I lead will ever put the British rebate back up for negotiation.</p>
	<p pid="b.33.1/11">We put down a marker at this Council. We stood up for the taxpayer. Together with like-minded allies, we rejected unacceptable increases in European spending, and we protected the UK&#8217;s rebate. We are fighting hard for the best deal for Britain, and that is what we will continue to do. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.35.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40208" speakername="Edward Miliband" colnum="35"  time="016:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0001.htm#12112614000694">
	<p pid="b.35.0/1">I thank the Prime Minister for his statement. Clearly, this is not the first EU budget negotiation to go into a second round, and no doubt it will not be the last. The real question remains what deal will eventually be delivered. I want to ask about the budget level, what the budget will be spent on and the Government&#8217;s negotiating position.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/2">On the budget level, I was surprised by one omission in the Prime Minister&#8217;s statement. Somehow, he forgot to thank this House for sending him into the talks with the strongest possible mandate in the negotiations: a vote supported by Members on both the Government and Opposition sides. At the time of the vote, the Deputy Prime Minister, who I notice is absent, said that what was voted on was a completely unrealistic position and that there was no hope of getting a deal&#8212;a tell-tale sign that the opposite might be true.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/3">Given that the Prime Minister now says that there is widespread support in Europe for a tough settlement, can he say what prospects there are for meeting the call of this House of Commons for a real-terms cut in the EU budget? Does he now regret not seeking to build alliances for a real-terms cut in spending at the outset of negotiations? Looking ahead to the deal that still needs to be done, can the Prime Minister confirm in precise terms what he means by a real-terms freeze? There are obviously many different definitions around, but we have the Government&#8217;s definition set out by the then Economic Secretary in her memo of <phrase class="date" code="2011-07-16">16 July 2011</phrase>. That was for a European budget of &#8364;885 billion in actual payments over the seven-year commitment period. The Prime Minister has been somewhat coy on this point, so can he confirm that that remains the position as set out by the former Economic Secretary to the Treasury?</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/4">Next, may I ask the Prime Minister about the composition of the budget, which is as important as the budget level itself? We need to reshape the budget so that it supports jobs and growth with investment in infrastructure, energy and research and development. He said as he arrived in Brussels that</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/5">&#8220;it is not a time for tinkering&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/6">and at his press conference on Friday he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/7">&#8220;Already being contemplated is a big cut in agricultural spending&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/8">something that is supported in all parts of this House. However, what is the big cut in agricultural spending that he is talking about? Will he confirm that the proposal on the table sees agriculture spending remaining on average at 38.3% of the European budget&#8212;almost exactly the same level as it is now? Does he really believe that that is the major reform that is required in the spending of the European budget? Does he agree that what is even worse is that to keep the subsidies high, money is being taken from much-needed investment in energy and other infrastructure? I think that part of that comes from the Connecting Europe budget. Did he object to this part of the proposal?</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/9">As we anticipate the further negotiations in the months ahead, the wider stance of the Government towards the EU will also have an impact. The Prime Minister has said repeatedly that he is in favour of Britain remaining a member of the European Union. Why, therefore, is he allowing his colleagues to take the opposite position? Last month, the Education Secretary briefed that he is open to leaving the European Union. On Saturday, the</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/10">chairman of the Conservative party said that we should threaten to leave if we did not get a good deal. Now we have the new vice-chair of the Conservative party&#8212;we think it is great to see him in his place&#8212;touring the studios, talking not about a budget deal but about a deal with the UK Independence party. Does the Prime Minister believe that such divisions help or hinder our national interest in delivering a good budget deal? Why, at a time of continuing negotiations over the budget, is he allowing members of his Cabinet openly to undermine his position on membership of the EU? It is no wonder that everyone, from British business to our European allies, believes that we are drifting towards the exit door.</p>
	<p pid="b.35.0/11">As we look ahead to the next round of budget negotiations, is not the reality of the situation that the Prime Minister has a divided party on Europe? Instead of confronting the issue&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> They say that they are not divided, but half of them want to leave the EU, and that is not the position of the Prime Minister&#8212;so we gather. He has a divided party on Europe, and instead of confronting the issue he is just letting the problem get worse. He spent his statement talking about the deal that he did not do; what matters is what he delivers for Britain. For as long as he allows his party to drag him towards the exit door, he will find it far harder to build lasting alliances and far harder to deliver for the national interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.36.0/1">First, let me answer on the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s specific points about figures. He asked about the scale of the cut that was envisaged for the common agricultural policy. In terms of tier 1 of the CAP, the proposal, to be fair to pillar one&#8212;to be fair to the Council and to the Commission&#8212;was to cut it from &#8364;336 billion to about &#8364;270 billion. So a cut was proposed for the CAP, but we made the point that even with that, we could go ahead and reach a good budget settlement. We said that without doing even more on the CAP we could reach a deal by looking at administrative savings and Commission savings, and also by looking at some of the programmes that are, quite rightly, being expanded, but expanded far too much. For example, Europe spent &#8364;8 billion on the Connecting Europe proposal in the last financial period, and it was proposed that that was increased to some &#8364;36 billion, so we could make significant cuts in that proposal and still land a sensible deal.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.0/2">The right hon. Gentleman referred to the memorandum that we put in front of this House, which referred to the 2011 situation and the 2011 budget. What I have said is that, yes, we want a cut, but we should settle, at worst, for a real-terms freeze&#8212;and of course that freeze would be across the period 2013 to 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.0/3">The right hon. Gentleman asked why we had not built any alliances. I am happy to tell him that the Dutch, the Swedes, the Danes, the Finns and the Germans all very much backed our position. I might ask him about his alliance, as he is in alliance with the socialists in the European Parliament, whose position was to favour a 5% increase in the ceilings, not a cut. They wanted to end all rebates and to introduce a financial transactions tax of up to &#8364;200 billion. If he does not believe that, he should listen to the leader of the European socialists and democrats, Mr Hannes Swoboda, who said:</p>
	<p pid="b.36.0/4">&#8220;Regarding the additional cuts, it is unacceptable that the majority of member countries are letting themselves be blackmailed by David Cameron&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.0/5">That is the view of the socialists.</p>
	<p pid="b.36.0/6">The right hon. Gentleman has made his approach in this Parliament, but if he had been at the Council he would have heard a lecture by the socialist head of the European Parliament, who told the whole Council that anything that was a cut to what was being proposed would be completely opposed by everyone in the socialist group in the European Parliament, including his MPs. If the right hon. Gentleman wants to get a good deal for Britain, he might start by talking some sense to his socialist friends.</p>

As for his comments about the Germans, I hope that he is a regular reader of <i>Der Spiegel</i> online, because after the Council it said:</p>

	<p pid="b.37.3/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes an important point. Frontex does good work and we have supported its budget, but like any Government, what we are asking the European Commission and European Council to do is attempt to do more for less. They have to look across each budget area, work out where the pressures are and, obviously, direct resources in that way, but they also have to try to find savings elsewhere, as every Department of Government has had to do.</p>

The countries on the list that I read out are our classic allies that we put together in almost every year&#8217;s budget negotiations to try to ensure a reasonable outcome. The problem is that annual budgets are decided on a qualified majority basis, so we can be outvoted. The multi-annual financial framework is subject to unanimity, so we can put our case vigorously. The point that I made in my statement is that if we do not achieve a new framework, we will need even more than today to keep the tough budget discipline together for the annual budget negotiations that follow.</p>

Britain&#8217;s negotiating position is different from that of many countries in that we do not go to Brussels and simply defend every penny that we receive; we try to seek an outcome that is right for the whole European Union.

	<p pid="b.40.3/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right. We will keep pushing forward the growth agenda, based on completing the single market in digital, services and energy. It is also important to recognise that the budget, even with the reductions I propose, would still be a growth budget, because it would transfer funds from agriculture into growth areas such as supporting research and investment, from which Britain is quite well placed to benefit.</p>

Youth unemployment is far lower in, for instance, Holland and Germany than in Spain, Italy and&#8212;yes&#8212;the UK. There is more to learn about welfare reform, apprenticeships and education standards. We can apply those lessons here to ensure that we keep unemployment falling.</p>

Given what we have done in the UK, such as abolishing or merging about 200 quangos and cutting central Government Departments&#8217; own spending by about 30% in some cases, there is clearly room in the EU&#8212;not just in the Commission but in the other institutions&#8212;to find proper savings in cost and bureaucracy. We should continue pushing at that. The seven-year multi-annual financial framework provides the one moment when we really have the opportunity to drive home the advantage and make those cuts.</p>

According to so-called heading 5 &#8212;administrative costs&#8212;between 2007 and 2013 the EU was spending &#8364;56.5 billion under that heading, but the proposals from the Commission and the presidency of the Council were to increase that figure to &#8364;62.6 billion. Far from just freezing the figures, they were looking to increase them. That is one reason why I think it is perfectly possible to make a cut in their proposal. That is not unrealistic or tokenistic, or just some populist urge; it is a proper way of saving several billion euros and getting an affordable budget.</p>

We were talking about the tough pension changes, budget changes, administration changes and cuts that we have had to make, and it is just not acceptable for Brussels to continue as though nothing has changed.</p>

	<p pid="b.49.3/1">May I congratulate the Prime Minister on the important work that he did this weekend, particularly the alliance building? It is clearly absurd of the EU to say that there can be no cuts in the central administrative budgets when, up and down this country, councils such as mine in Wandsworth are finding ways of doing it at local government level. Surely it is inconceivable that it cannot be done at EU level.</p>

	<p pid="b.49.4/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. I have set out in my statement and also at the European Council a number of specific steps that could be taken on pay bills, on pensions and on automatic promotion. Frankly, however, perhaps the best way of getting the Commission to engage in the reality is to give it a cut that it has to achieve and then challenge it to do so. That is what we have done with some Government Departments. We have said to them, &#8220;Okay, you know your Department and your departmental spending better than anyone. Here is the sort of reduction you need to achieve.&#8221; There is not an organisation or business in the world that has not had to budget for a 10% or 20% reduction over the past few years, and we should ask the Commission to do that.</p>

	<p pid="b.49.5/1">This statement certainly demonstrates that the building of an effective alliance on the European Council really can deliver some results. Through good leadership, that is clearly benefiting this country. Does the Prime Minister agree that the next big thing to do is to make sure that we have a truly competitive Europe and that the alliance that he has created should be used as a powerful mechanism to demonstrate what we need and how to get it?</p>

	<p pid="b.50.0/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. That is why we spent so much time putting together the so-called like-minded group, particularly over single market issues where we have not only the traditional allies of Denmark, Holland and Germany, but the Baltic states, the Nordic states and now the Italians and the Spanish, along with others including the Hungarians and the Czechs.

	<p pid="b.50.2/1">I can certainly give my hon. Friend the assurance that we do not support new EU taxes. One of the ways in which particularly the left in Europe has endlessly tried to argue for higher budgets for more spending is by altering the so-called &#8220;own resources&#8221; and coming up with new taxes. We oppose a financial transactions tax. Some countries may well go ahead and introduce it in any case. If they do, as far as I am concerned, that is their own decision and we will not take part in it.</p>

	<p pid="b.50.4/1">My hon. Friend is entirely right. The Commission initially came up with a proposal that was over a trillion euros. One problem has been the need to argue against a proposal that is clearly wrong and wrong-headed and bring it back to some sort of sanity before it becomes possible to argue about getting a proper outcome for the budget. It is not often that we hear politicians say this, but what is lacking in some cases is a Treasury approach of going through these budgets rather than having people like the permanent staff all sitting around in the Commission and in the Council protecting their own budgets rather than looking at the savings that should be made.</p>

I think we need to make sure that the voice of the people of Europe, who want to see tough budgets, is properly heard. There may be more that Parliaments can do in scrutinising European spending and helping to come up with some sensible savings, which we can then take to the Council table and get agreed.</p>

	<p pid="b.52.1/1">With permission, Mr. Speaker, I shall make a statement on flooding.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/2">The House will be aware of the exceptional rainfall that has been experienced over the last few days, and will also be aware that as a result some areas across the United Kingdom have been flooded and others continue to be at risk of flooding. The Environment Agency currently has 197 flood warnings and 291 flood alerts in place in England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/3">Tragically, three people lost their lives over the weekend. Two were men whose cars were caught up in flood water in Somerset and Cambridgeshire, and the third was a woman who was killed in Devon by a falling tree. I am sure that the whole House will wish to express its profound sympathy to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/4">Heavy rainfall is not unusual at this time of year. However, we experienced bands of low pressure over the weekend, bringing often intense rainfall on catchments that are now saturated. Areas in the south-west of England, Wales and the midlands received 20 to 30 mm &#8212;over an inch&#8212;of rain in most places, and up to 50 to 60 mm&#8212;over 2 inches&#8212;fell in 24 hours elsewhere. Persistent rain will continue to affect much of northern England, south-east Scotland and north Wales today.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/5">As a result of the rain, there has been significant river and surface water flooding in Cornwall, Devon, Wiltshire, Worcestershire, the midlands, Yorkshire and Wales, and there is a continued risk of significant flooding in parts of north-east England and north Wales. More than 900 properties have been flooded, of which up to 500 are in the south-west, more than 200 in the midlands and more than 100 in Wales. A great many people have been evacuated, and the numbers may well increase given the further rain forecast for today and early tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/6">The Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40418" name="Richard Benyon">the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon)</phrase>, visited Malmesbury in Wiltshire on Sunday, and saw for himself the damage caused by the flooding to homes in the centre of the town. I visited Northampton on Friday and Exeter and Kennford earlier today, and saw some of the devastation caused by the flooding there. I spoke to families who had had to leave their homes with their children in the middle of the night, and people who had flood water a good way up their walls. I really do want to praise the local Environment Agency and council staff, because this was a real example of partnership working in action.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/7">I also feel desperately sorry for the residents of Kempsey, in Worcestershire, whose properties were flooded when the local pumps failed. The Environment Agency will be carrying out a detailed investigation into what happened.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/8">Many areas, such as the Somerset Levels, have experienced significant flooding of farmland. That has had a major impact on local farmers, who have lost grazing land and crops. In Somerset, which is still an area of serious concern, the Environment Agency is already working with the community to review the floods that have happened during 2012, and to consider how flood water could be better managed. The flooding</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/9">has also disrupted road and rail networks. Many roads were closed, particularly in the south-west, in Solihull, across north Yorkshire, in Gloucestershire&#8212;including the M5&#8212;and in other areas, including County Durham and Teesside.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/10">The main concerns for Network Rail have been the routes between Exeter and Taunton and between Exeter and Yeovil. The route between Exeter and Taunton was badly affected, with parts of the track under 2 feet of water. Buses have replaced trains in a number of areas. Some routes have reopened, although there may still be delays to some journeys. I saw some of the damaged track for myself, and since my visit I have discussed these issues with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/11">I extend my sincere thanks to the many people who responded so magnificently to these events. They include staff of fire, ambulance, police and other rescue services, local authorities, the Environment Agency, the voluntary sector and local communities. I appreciate how hard everyone has been working, and how difficult it is for those whose homes and businesses have been affected. I assure the House that the Environment Agency and its local emergency partners, including local authorities, are working round the clock and doing all they can to prevent flooding in areas currently at risk. My officials have been working closely with other Departments throughout the recent events.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/12">Protecting our communities against flooding is a vital priority for the Government, and I am pleased to say that over the past few days nearly 50,000 properties have been protected by recently built flood defences. The Environment Agency issued flood warnings to over 93,000 properties, and such warnings are often crucial in giving people time to protect their properties or move precious belongings to somewhere safe. More than 1.1 million households have now signed up to the Environment Agency&#8217;s flood warning system, and I encourage others at high flood risk to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/13">Nationally held flood rescue equipment was deployed to support local partners in Devon and Cornwall; six high-volume pumps were used and four boats were deployed, managed locally by the fire and rescue service national co-ordination centre. As flood waters recede, we will move into the recovery effort, which will need support from across central, regional and local government, as well as from businesses and voluntary organisations. I know that local communities are pulling together as recovery operations begin in earnest.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/14">The Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will be activating the Bellwin scheme of emergency financial assistance to help local authorities with the immediate costs associated with protecting life and property in their areas. The scheme will reimburse local authorities for 85% of their eligible costs above the threshold. Government officials will also discuss recovery arrangements with local authorities in the areas affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.52.1/15">The recent flooding has been a tragedy for those affected, and I finish by paying tribute to the wonderful community spirit that I, the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury, and Members across the House have witnessed as communities rally round to support people in need. I shall, of course, keep the House informed of any further significant developments.</p>

	<p pid="b.54.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for his update.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/2">I begin by paying tribute to the emergency services that worked to evacuate homes, rescue those who were stranded and keep people safe this weekend. I echo the Secretary of State&#8217;s thanks to staff of the Environment Agency and local councils who worked all weekend&#8212;and throughout the night on Saturday&#8212;clearing rivers and ensuring that flood defences were activated.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/3">Hon. Members from across the House will wish to send their condolences to the family and friends of the three people who tragically lost their lives. With two months&#8217; worth of rain set to fall in the north of the country today, we are not yet in the clear. The communities affected face months of disruption and upheaval. People who were cleaning up after the July floods have been flooded again, and some have been flooded more than once this week. Pubs that were looking forward to their busiest period are throwing out carpets and cancelling bookings.</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/4">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs classes areas as being at low, medium or high risk of flooding. Have this week&#8217;s floods triggered the medium-risk threshold that activates the Cabinet Office civil contingencies secretariat? Will the Secretary of State tell the House how many schools, roads, railways and businesses have been affected across the country so far, and how many people have been evacuated? How many acres of productive farmland are under water, and what estimate has he made of crop losses to farmers?</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/5">The Secretary of State mentioned the Somerset levels, which rely on drainage boards. The Environment Agency, however, is already consulting on changes to flood management, pump houses and maintaining river courses. Will he guarantee that those operations will be protected in future? What contact has he had with the Department for Education to ensure that children whose schools have been flooded continue to be educated? What contact has he had with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government on the recovery effort? Is he aware that there is no statutory obligation on fire services to respond to flood events, and does he share my concern that the current round of cuts to fire and rescue authorities, particularly in metropolitan areas, is reducing our resilience to flood events in future years?</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/6">The Secretary of State&#8217;s predecessor, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40391" name="Caroline Spelman">the right hon. Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman)</phrase>, told the House in a written statement in June that central Government would cover 100% of local authority costs under the Bellwin scheme, yet today the Secretary of State has announced that just 85% of their costs will be met in the case of the latest floods. Why is that?</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/7">Councils have just one month after a flood incident to lodge with the DCLG a claim for reimbursement under Bellwin. However, Bellwin covers only the costs of immediate action to safeguard life and property, such as evacuation and rehousing, not the capital costs of road repairs. Just three of the 20 areas flooded last summer have reached the Bellwin threshold to receive any money at all from the Government. Have the Government made any payments to those three councils for the costs of the June and July floods? If, as I suspect, they have not, when can councils expect that money?</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/8">What measures has the Secretary of State put in place to help the other 17 councils whose claims did not meet the Bellwin threshold? Whether the Government cover 85% or 100% of the costs, their failure to help 17 of the 20 councils affected in the summer is no help at all. What funding will he put in place for major capital expenditure on damaged roads?</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/9">After the 2007 and 2009 floods, the Government set up the flood recovery grant as a one-off payment to councils to help households seriously affected by the floods. This Government have chosen not to help communities in that way. Why is that?</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/10">What support will the Government give to those who are under-insured or uninsured? The answer has to be more than warm tweets from the Prime Minister. As we move from response to recovery, flood-hit communities are growing more and more anxious about the availability and affordability of flood insurance. The Secretary of State&#8217;s predecessor told the House in June that</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/11">&#8220;we are at an advanced stage in intensive and constructive negotiations with the insurance industry&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-06-25.26"><i>Official Report</i>, 25 June 2012; Vol. 547, c. 26</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/12">Yet the Association of British Insurers has stated today that a deal on the future of flood insurance has &#8220;stalled&#8221;. We were promised a deal in the spring, and then by July. It is now November. What has happened? If the deal is not done by the time of the autumn statement in just nine days, the risk of people being unable to insure, mortgage and eventually sell their home will rise exponentially. We must not have whole communities blighted because the Chancellor refuses to negotiate in good faith. When will he get a grip on the issue?</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/13">We know that every pound invested in flood defences saves &#163;8 in costs further down the line, yet this Government have cut capital spending on flood defences by 30% from the 2010 baseline. They are spending less on flood defences now than we were five years ago in 2007. As a result, 294 flood defence schemes have been deferred or cancelled. Will the Secretary of State resist any pressure from the Treasury to cut flood defence spending in the next comprehensive spending review?</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/14">Last Monday in Westminster Hall, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40286" name="Brandon Lewis">the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis)</phrase>, told Members that</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/15">&#8220;while the flooding incidents of this summer were locally significant, we did not witness the devastating effects of previous years.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2012-11-20.93"><i>Official Report, </i>20 November 2012; Vol. 553, c. 93WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.54.0/16">Communities that have been devastated by flooding should not have to listen to Ministers telling them that their experience is not nationally significant. Today and this weekend, we have once again had a reminder that floods are the greatest threat that climate change poses to our country, and flood-hit communities deserve not to have to go through that terrible experience again.</p>

	<p pid="b.55.0/1">I thank the hon. Lady for echoing my tributes to the Environment Agency, councils and all those who have worked so extraordinarily hard in recent days. I thank her also for expressing her sympathies to those who have lost relations and friends.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/2">The hon. Lady asked detailed questions about the picture on schools, roads and crops. It is too early to</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/3">tell, because the current weather is carrying on, and I think we had better review those questions when it settles down.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/4">The hon. Lady mentioned local councils. We are co-ordinating the matter carefully and meeting DCLG on a regular basis, including on the subject of fire services. She mentioned the Bellwin scheme, which we have continued in exactly the same vein as the previous Government. There is a 0.2% threshold, and we have said that we will pay up to 85% of costs. We will keep that under review and keep assessing the situation as it develops.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/5">The hon. Lady mentioned flood insurance. Today&#8217;s story is complete nonsense. The first meeting I had on taking office was with the ABI. We have had constructive and detailed discussions with it since, and there was a senior level meeting as recently as the end of last week. I am looking forward to receiving the ABI&#8217;s latest suggestions. We are determined to arrive at a replacement for the statement of principles that provides universality, is affordable and does not put a major burden on the taxpayer. I would like to remind the hon. Lady that the statement of principles covers 2003 to 2013, and we inherited absolutely nothing from the previous Government on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.55.0/6">The hon. Lady mentioned spending on flood defences, and there is a complete canard about this reduction; our reduction is 6% over the whole spending round compared with what Labour spent over its spending round. I would have thought that she would have been pleased that our partnership scheme is really working, and a range of schemes that were just on the threshold and did not make the cut will now go ahead. In the last major incident, in 2007, 55,000 homes were flooded but this time the figure is 5,000 to 6,000. That is still traumatic for those households, and I repeat that my real sympathies are with those affected. I stress that we are continuing with a major programme of flood defence schemes to reduce the number further.</p>

	<p pid="b.56.0/1">Today&#8217;s tragedy is truly of national proportions, but the response has been so much more effective after the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 came into effect. Will the Secretary of State revisit the damage done in September to the roads and bridges in north Yorkshire, which has now been made 10 times worse today? Will he also examine the impact on the community of operating theatres potentially closing at the Friarage hospital in Northallerton, as well as of school and road closures? There is something the Government could do to ease the impact of surface water flooding: introduce the regulations on sustainable urban drainage long before the deadline of 2014, which marks a huge delay from what was originally proposed.</p>

The Secretary of State will know that Exeter narrowly escaped a flooding disaster over the weekend. It tops the south-west Environment Agency&#8217;s list of priority schemes for upgraded flood defence. The city and county councils have come up with money to help fill the shortfall left by his Government&#8217;s cuts.

Developers in Formby and Lydiate in my constituency want to build on farmland that often floods. Will he ensure that the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government do not prevail in their desire to force through development in areas, such as my constituency, that already have a significant problem with flooding?</p>

Thankfully, the flood defences worked, but Mr Bramley has lost more than &#163;50,000-worth of crops.

Will he also address the public concerns in Devon about the resilience of our infrastructure, particularly Cowley bridge, which controls rail in and out of the county to Paddington, the Clennon valley pumping station in my constituency, which deals with most of the sewerage in Torbay, and roads throughout Devon that were cut off from the rest of Devon at some point over the weekend?</p>

	<p pid="b.64.1/1">I went to Cowley bridge to look at the damage to the railway line and I am pleased to say that it will be mended by tomorrow, which will be a triumph for those involved, because I was told that something like 200 tonnes of aggregate had shifted. The hon. Gentleman is right to raise a number of detailed issues, and they will have to be worked through by local councils and agencies. I was impressed by the resilience of all those affected by events in recent days and I have every confidence that they will see their way through this situation.</p>

	<p pid="b.64.2/1">West Worcestershire has had the benefit of six new flood defence schemes since 2007. They have protected 360 homes and more than &#163;8 million has been spent on them. Sadly, the Kempsey pump failed on Sunday morning, and I pay tribute to the engineers and emergency workers who came out in the middle of the night to fix it. When the investigation discovers the cause of the incident, will the Environment Agency seek compensation from the manufacturers of the pump, and how will it get that compensation to the home owners whose homes were flooded? How will the situation resolve itself in the long term in respect of the insurance for those homes?</p>

	<p pid="b.64.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising the situation in Kempsey. It was sickening that, according to my knowledge, the pump failed at 4 am. The scheme was designed to protect 70 properties, but 20 of those were damaged. A detailed investigation into what happened is taking place. I congratulate the Environment Agency on getting the pump going again. I believe that it had tripped out. There will be detailed results from the investigation and we will take the matter further when we see them.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.2/1">I thank the Secretary of State for coming to the House and informing us in such detail of what is happening and what he has been doing over the past few days. Flooding is occurring on the embankment in Wellingborough. Northamptonshire&#8217;s fire brigade and local councils are doing an excellent job. Like other Members, I ask the Secretary of State to look again at the issue of building on the floodplain, because regional spatial strategies forced councils to have residential homes in areas where they opposed them.</p>

	<p pid="b.65.3/1">I went very close to my hon. Friend&#8217;s patch on Friday and saw the scheme that worked incredibly effectively in protecting Northampton town. The Nene was tamed. He rightly says that the huge wet area was saturated. I saw a permanent caravan site that had been badly flooded and a large number of people had been evacuated. I pay tribute to all the agencies in his area that I met: the Environment Agency, the police, the fire service and the local council. He is right that it is completely barmy to build on floodplains. I want to drill it in to everyone who is listening that the NPPF makes it very clear that that is a bad idea and that it should not happen.</p>

	<p pid="b.70.0/1">I look forward to further interesting debates on the proposals&#8212;we had interesting debates both on Second Reading and in Committee. This large group includes significant proposals, although a number are consequential on acceptance of the main amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/2">We discussed a number of the significant proposals on Second Reading and in Committee. They follow a pattern. I thank the Minister&#8212;it might be one of the few times I do so&#8212;for listening to some, but not all, of the concerns raised in Committee. At the time, it was not always clear that he would introduce amendments or deal with other things, but I thank him for listening. Crucially for the charities, if not for the Opposition, he has responded to points that the charitable sector raised with us.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/3">Today we have once again heard concerns from the wider charity sector about the reported deficit of more than &#163;300 million in 2011, which it has brought to public attention. That shows the current difficulty of getting donations and income into charities while at the same time they are facing increased burdens on the services they provide&#8212;not that the sector sees its services as burdens. Hopefully, more charities will benefit from the Bill now than would have benefited from it when we debated it in pre-legislative scrutiny, on Second Reading and in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/4">We had long debates in Committee on some clauses and amendments. I am sure the House will be relieved to know that I have no wish to repeat them verbatim&#8212;that would be unhelpful&#8212;but it is worth noting that the same issues came up in Committee time and again, which suggested that further work needed to be done to amend the Bill. We also need to continue to scrutinise what the Bill will do in the light of subsequent amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/5">There is an extensive list of proposals in the group, and I want to refer to a number of them. It would be wise of me to put on record that we have tabled new clauses 1 and 2 because they would deal with a number of concerns that the Opposition and the charity sector have raised throughout the Bill&#8217;s progress. Perhaps the Government have acknowledged&#8212;in their amendments in Committee and on Report&#8212;that the original Bill was not drafted as tightly as it might have been, or in a way that ensured as much fairness and equity as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/6">It is therefore right and proper that we return to the issue of formally reviewing the Bill after a two-year period. The Minister said many times in Committee that he was willing to look again at the measures and acknowledged that he wished to amend the Bill&#8212;we will discuss that later. However, when the Chancellor first announced the scheme, he said he wanted it to deliver</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/7">&#8220;gift aid on the contents of the collecting tin and the street bucket&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2011-03-23.962"><i>Official Report</i>, 23 March 2011; Vol. 525, c. 962</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/8">He also pledged that the reforms would be &#8220;bureaucracy-lite&#8221;. That theme has run throughout our discussions.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/9">The Bill will doubtless benefit a number of charities and community amateur sports clubs, which is welcome, but the Government need to reassure charities that they are committed to making the Bill the best it can be. Given that many of the concerns that have been outlined will not result in changes to the Bill before Royal Assent, we can know how well the scheme is performing in practice only if there is a formal review. In any event, it would be good practice to review legislation after a period of its operation. That theme ran through a number of proposals that the Opposition tabled in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/10">The Minister will note that we are trying in new clauses 1 and 2 to add extra detail to the report that we originally asked for in Committee. Let me say a few words about why a detailed report is so important. I do not want to go through all the arguments again, but we heard in Committee that anywhere between a third and a fifth of charities would benefit as a result of both the strict eligibility criteria and the community buildings and connected charities provisions, which we have debated extensively at various stages. The corollary to that is that a significant number of charities will be unable to benefit. The scheme could therefore be divisive, favouring some types of charities over others. That theme also ran through the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/11">Attempting to solve one problem often produced unintended consequences and difficulties&#8212;I am thinking of our debates on churches, and on large versus small charities&#8212;and that is why we ask in the new clauses for a breakdown and a review that gives more detail. That is important. New clause 1 mentions registered charities, exempt and excepted charities, and charities in different regions. That would mean that we can fully understand the impact of the scheme once it is in operation and redress any inequalities as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/12">We spoke extensively in Committee about the complexity of the Bill. As we heard, it is estimated that 160 pages of guidance on Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs website will be needed to explain it. There are 80 pages on registering for gift aid, so perhaps we can agree that the Bill is more complex than we would like it to be. Not just the Opposition and the charity sector understood that and raised such particulars; the Minister, in the sixth sitting of the Bill Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2012-10-23">23 October</phrase>, admitted that the rules were complex in response to one of my hon. Friends. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/13">&#8220;I readily admit that this part of the Bill is complex and that we do not know exactly how it will work until it comes into practice.&#8221;<i>&#8211;&#8211;</i>[<i>Official Report, Small Charitable Donations Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2012-10-23">23 October 2012</phrase>; c. 207.]</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/14">In another Committee sitting, he said that</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/15">&#8220;the very nature of trying to capture issues such as connectivity&#8212;whether it is here where we are dealing with charity, or in other laws where we are dealing with trusts&#8212;is complex.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/16">He has also said that:</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/17">&#8220;Clearly HMRC is like any organisation; mistakes can always be found.&#8221;&#8211;&#8211;[<i>Official Report, Small Charitable Donations Public Bill Committee, </i><phrase class="date" code="2012-10-25">25 October 2012</phrase>; c. 223-5.]</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/18">I make those points simply to reinforce the rationale for building into the process a formal review, because of the nature and complexity of the Bill and the amount of guidance that will be required. At one point in Committee, I said that if a charity had &#163;1 for every word of guidance needed, there would be a fairly significant donation to good causes. It is important that the Bill requires a formal review, so that we can understand the provisions and ensure that we keep tabs on the costs of the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/19">In the Minister&#8217;s deliberations in Committee, he often spoke of having to be a good guardian of the public purse. I would have thought that it would therefore be only right and proper for the Government to commit formally to reviewing the costs of the scheme after an appropriate period&#8212;reviewing the spending, because the Minister said that as many charities as were eligible would be able to take part in the scheme, and to ensure that the money was equitably distributed, identifying any problems in the regions of the different nations that make up the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/20">There are a number of concerns about the data on which we begin the process. The Minister was good enough to write to the Opposition to answer a number of the questions we raised in advance of the debate. He mentions in his letter amending the matching rate; amending the eligibility period to two years; introducing a power to amend the eligibility criteria in future; and changing the powers in some of the clauses. He goes on to give some information about organisations that can claim gift aid but are not covered by Charity Commission data. He gives figures, and that is helpful, although&#8212;as is often the case in these scenarios&#8212;the answers to questions immediately prompt a series of other questions. Some of the responses that we have subsequently had from the charity sector suggest confusion in some areas, and I hope that the Minister will be able to clear that up. He could also help us to establish that baseline from which the success or otherwise of the scheme could be judged in the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/21">For example, in the Minister&#8217;s letter he suggests that 60% of the organisations claiming gift aid in 2009-10 were registered charities. I am not entirely sure what that 60% represents. Was that 60% of the 68,357 charities to which gift aid repayments were made in 2009-10? That figure comes from HMRC&#8217;s own release. If that is the case, it would suggest that just over 41,000 registered charities were claiming gift aid in that year, which of course means that some 40% of the total were claiming other types. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify the point and reassure us.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/22">The Minister also indicates in his letter that HMRC does not hold data on the number of charities making gift aid claims. That is a bit confusing because HMRC has been able to provide some statistics and figures, so it seems that it does hold some underlying data, if perhaps not all of the data that we have sought. It would be helpful to have some clarity on that point. Does HMRC not hold up-to-date data on the number of registered charities or have we somehow misunderstood the Minister&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/23">letter? If so, the charitable sector is saying that it too could have misunderstood, and that does not bode well for good communications.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/24">It would be helpful if we were able to ensure that we have such provision in the Bill. As we know, Ministers come and Ministers go. This Minister is relatively new in post and it is good to see that he is still here to reap the benefits and take the plaudits when the Bill passes&#8212;as it no doubt will&#8212;but another Minister may come along in due course who may not have paid quite so much attention to the Bill and perhaps has not fully appreciated the amount of attention to detail from this Minister and the commitments that he made in Committee. For that reason, it would be helpful to have something on the face of the Bill, as outlined in new clauses 1 and 2.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/25">I fully appreciate the fact that the Minister has tabled some amendments, to which he will speak in due course. Depending on what he has to say, those amendments may make some of the amendments that we have tabled superfluous or redundant, but it is important to place on record our reasons for tabling them.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/26">A whole series of consequential amendments flow from amendments 8 and 9, which provide for a sort of probationary period for charities before they qualify. The Minister will no doubt already be thinking that his amendments on the claims history would give more benefits to some charities than our amendments. That may well be the case, but the counter-argument would be that under our amendments charities would be able to benefit sooner.</p>
	<p pid="b.70.0/27">The Minister will also remember that in Committee we tabled several amendments pushing him to reconsider various aspects of clause 2. We did that because the sector essentially felt that the three-year history of successful gift aid claims and the requirement that charities must have been in existence for at least three complete tax years before they could benefit from the scheme were overly onerous and out of proportion to any risk of fraud. The Government have tabled some amendments in this area and I take that as a sign that they have listened to our concerns and taken steps in the right direction.</p>

	<p pid="b.73.0/1">Is it the hon. Lady&#8217;s understanding that Government amendment 31, which seems to allow some flexibility for subsequent changes of the rules, nevertheless&#8212;according to the explanatory statement in the notes&#8212;insists that previous gift aid claims have to have been made, which of course may well preclude large numbers of the very small charities that the Minister presumably wants to help? Therefore it will still work against the interests of some of the smallest charities, and I am personally very disappointed that an amendment with more flexibility has not been tabled.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.73.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" colnum="73"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0002.htm#12112627000644">
	<p pid="b.73.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for making that powerful point, and we will come back to it later when we discuss other amendments. Whatever happens, I would hope that the Minister sees the point that the hon. Gentleman raises as a reason for ensuring that, at the very least, a review clause is built into the Bill. We would want to know whether a continuing number of small charities continued to be unable to access the scheme and gain benefits. Indeed, at some</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/2">stage we will discuss the whole question of charities set up in response to particular circumstances&#8212;for very worthy causes&#8212;that may not be able to benefit at all from the scheme because the need will have been met and they will have moved on by the point at which they become eligible even to apply.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/3">The idea behind the scheme is to boost the income of small groups that rely on bucket donations, and the hon. Gentleman has pointed out very succinctly that there are many such groups which simply will not be able to take advantage of the scheme, including those which do not have the resources to apply for gift aid or are just starting out. Our amendments seek to help those charities by removing the requirement for the start-up period and instead introducing a qualification period. We had some debate on this in Committee and our amendment would allow charities&#8212;new or established &#8212;without that claims history of gift aid to claim for a reduced amount of &#163;2,000 after one year of claims history and then to claim for the full &#163;5,000 once they had built up a three-year history.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/4">As we have already heard, there are concerns that the Government&#8217;s requirements will be a significant barrier to participation for many charities that have not previously registered. They will also exclude organisations to which even an additional &#163;500 would make a huge difference in income. Instead, it would tend to favour the bigger, more established organisations that may have the finance and fundraising departments to make gift aid claims. Many of the smaller, ineligible charities will already have been registered with the official regulator for three years. They will have had to submit accounts and pass the fit and proper person test, which is pretty robust. For some charities, their major fundraising may be from non-eligible sources, such as donations from trusts, events and charity shops, and they will not have been able to claim gift aid for the required three years even if they have significant income from small donations through collections which would be eligible for this scheme. For trustworthy established charities to be forced to wait a number of years before making claims reduces the incentives for registering.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/5">The sector gave us a couple of examples. I will not go into all the detail, but one example was Wansbeck CVS, which has just set up a small grants fund in memory of a community development worker. It is designed to give small grants to local charities, but it had not been previously registered for gift aid. Under the current proposals, only donations received years after it registers for gift aid will be eligible. That is one of the examples of possible problems we were given.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/6">We suggested that introducing a qualification period would go some way towards allowing charities that stand to benefit most from the scheme to be able to claim a reduced amount of &#163;2,000 after only one year. That would at least allow them to cover their administration costs for claiming, while giving them an incentive to fundraise further and claim for standard gift aid. We tabled the amendments to try to provide a way forward that would balance the risk of fraud, identified by the Minister in Committee, with the ability to give a boost to the scheme for charities that need all the help they can get in tough times.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/7">Amendments 17, 18, 19 and 20 relate to community buildings, on which points have been raised consistently during this process. The Minister will recall that in</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/8">Committee we tabled a number of amendments to try to change the community buildings provisions substantially. We believe that they are seriously flawed and unfair to charities that would find themselves disadvantaged and unable to benefit. Many in the sector were disappointed that the Government did not give any ground, and I am disappointed that they have not used the opportunity of the Report stage to reconsider, as the Minister has done on other matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/9">I suspect that the Minister will not move on these provisions, but if we cannot have a wholesale change to the Bill at this stage, I hope that the Government will at least be persuaded to look again at one particular aspect of the community buildings provisions. Clause 6(3) defines the community building amount as</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/10">&#8220;the sum of the small donations that are made to the charity in the community building in the tax year by group members while it is running charitable activities in the building&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/11">Even before Second Reading, that point was raised consistently as one that had the potential to cause difficulty for some organisations. In an attempt to solve the problem in relation to churches&#8212;the Minister rightly and understandably wanted to find a solution&#8212;we have a scenario in which it will be very difficult for other charities to take advantage of this part of the scheme, and that will potentially cause more problems than it solves. As we have heard previously&#8212;it is worth reiterating the point&#8212;clause 6(6) goes on to define a group member as:</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/12">&#8220;a member of the group of people with whom the charity is carrying out the activity&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/13">We heard a number of examples relating to that point, most vividly from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40354" name="George Mudie">the Member for Leeds East (Mr Mudie)</phrase>, who spoke about a potential scenario with regard to a charitable group involving Alzheimer&#8217;s patients and asked whether it would only be those within the group who were able to make donations.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/14">We have an issue with the principle here. We are concerned that for a great number of charities the beneficiary and the donor groups are likely to be two separate constituencies of people, and we do not want that to become a discriminating factor in whether charities can access the scheme. Indeed, it seems to us to be the exception rather than the rule that funds would be raised during the course of charitable activities by those benefitting from them. If we set aside churches and the collection plate, there are many scenarios where it would be entirely inappropriate for the bucket to be passed around the 10 or more members sitting there while the charitable activity was being undertaken. For example, during counselling work or work that provides activities for young people, or in which young people are involved, that would simply not be sensible.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/15">The nature of fundraising is highly dependent on the type of activity and an organisation&#8217;s beneficiary group. The requirement in question would disadvantage the types of charities in respect of which it would not be appropriate or possible to raise funds in this way. Notwithstanding the debates we had in Committee, we still have concerns about whether such provision will go against the benefit principle of gift aid where gift aid is not available and where a donor receives personal benefit. In Committee, the Minister was at pains to say that that was not the case. However, we still have some concerns</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/16">about the wording in the Bill, so this is another area where it would be important to have some review and some consideration about whether the Bill will work as it is intended to.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/17">I will not repeat what was said in all the debates, but in Committee we heard that it would be difficult for such charities as Victim Support and the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society to benefit from these schemes, which is why we have tabled these amendments. Once again, the charitable sector&#8212;most recently the Charity Finance Group, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the Institute of Fundraising and the Charities Aid Foundation&#8212;has stressed that point. Such organisations are concerned that the only donations that will count will be those made within a community building. Although some changes have been made, there are concerns about whom the provision would actually apply to, because the people participating, not including staff or volunteers, might be vulnerable people.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/18">I appreciate that I am speaking at some length, but we have a number of important and significant amendments. In my notes, my shorthand for amendment 21 is that it is a review amendment. It may seem that all Opposition Members talk about is review, review, review, but I hope that I have begun to lay out exactly why we feel that the provision to review is important. Although we have tabled an amendment that focuses on the part of the community building provisions I have just been talking about, however, I do not want the Minister to think that we have given up on all the concerns we had on other aspects of the community building provisions.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/19">From our debates in Committee, the Minister will recall our concerns about clause 7. The clause states that charities must run their charitable activities &#8220;in a community building&#8221; for them to be eligible for top-up payments. We had a wide-ranging discussion about whether charitable activities could be run from community buildings, whether they had to be in community buildings and the relationship between the organisation setting up and those participating. The Bromsgrove scouts became a touchstone&#8212;how the provision would effect the Bromsgrove scouts became the main discussion point. We also heard from charities such as the Royal National lifeboat Institution, which runs its charitable activities&#8212;this has been mentioned on a number of occasions&#8212;at sea, and a large number of charities that run their activities in the community, such as Victim Support and the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society. They often hold their counselling sessions or work in homes or in other community spaces, and we heard concerns that those organisations should not lose out.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/20">We also raised concerns in Committee about clause 8, which specifically excludes from the scheme properties used for residential purposes, limiting the ability of care homes and hospices to access it. In Committee, the Minister stated that patients in hospices would still be registered at their homes, as he understood it, for the purposes of the Bill. People go to a hospice at a sad stage in their life, but to all intents and purposes their home is elsewhere and therefore should not count as a residence. He gave us some assurances on the care home sector, but there are still some concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/21">I gave the example of organisations providing residential provision for young people possibly for 52 weeks of the year. To all intents and purposes, such provision might form young people&#8217;s home for a time. There remain</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/22">concerns in that area. The sector is also concerned that this approach might be a bit short-sighted, failing to take into account not only the ageing population and possible changes in hospices&#8217; and care homes&#8217; functions but the possibility, notwithstanding the best will of the Minister, that the legislation might exclude people from benefiting.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/23">In addition to the community buildings provisions, clauses 4 and 5 aim to prevent charities from fragmenting so as to be eligible for more money under the scheme. Clause 5 defines the meaning of &#8220;connected charities&#8221; and stipulates that they are deemed to be &#8220;connected&#8221; if</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/24">&#8220;at least half of the trustees of one of the charities are&#8230;trustees of the other charity,&#8230;persons who are connected with persons who are trustees of the other charity, or&#8230;a combination of both.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/25">Once again, the Committee discussed at length how in small communities volunteers often sit on the boards of several local charities. The concern is that, although their work might not be connected, the charities could be deemed to be connected for the purposes of the Bill and, therefore, not eligible for the full top-up payments. Even more problematic was the possibility of charities being deemed connected if a man sits on one board, and his wife or sister sits on another.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/26">Clause 5(7) states that</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/27">&#8220;a charity is not to be regarded as connected with another charity at a time for the purposes of subsection (1) unless, at that time, the purposes and activities of the charities are the same or substantially similar.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/28">Our concern is that, in trying to create fairness in one area, the Government might&#8212;in the community buildings and connected charities clauses&#8212;have created areas of inequity between the different charitable causes. The reason for amendment 21, on providing for a review of the community buildings provisions, is to take account of these concerns. They have been consistently raised and have not gone away, notwithstanding the Minister&#8217;s best efforts in tabling further amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/29">Government amendment 28, on the definition of running charitable activities in a community building, shifts from HMRC to the Treasury the power to change the number of people who must be present during a charitable activity. Likewise, Government amendment 29 shifts from HMRC to the Treasury the power to decide whether a building qualifies as a community building. I will be interested to hear why the Minister has tabled those amendments at this stage. He will recall our extensive discussions on this subject in Committee. We probably spent longer on whether HMRC was the correct agency of government to deal with the Bill&#8217;s operation than on any other issue. I would be interested, therefore, to hear why he thinks this is important now. Are they technical amendments or does he accept that it would not be right for HMRC to deal with certain of these issues? It would be helpful if he could enlighten us.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/30">Amendments 32 and 33 relate to small charities. I have already touched on the concerns regarding small charities and what I described as pop-up charities&#8212;those that deal with a particular need which might not intend to be around for many years and which quickly move to collect substantial amounts of money. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase> will speak to her amendments in due course, and will want to say more about her rationale then. Whether the Minister accepts them or not, however, they touch on another reason</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/31">why the review clauses are important: they would enable us to review the scheme&#8217;s operation, taking into consideration organisations that might be able to benefit but which have been excluded because of how the scheme has been constructed and because of the sheer complexity of the application process for gift aid&#8212;there are 80 pages on gift aid and 160 pages of guidance&#8212;that organisations must go through to be absolutely certain that they are eligible.</p>
	<p pid="b.73.1/32">I look forward to hearing the Minister&#8217;s response. I stress again that we want the Bill to pass. The reason for the amendments and our consistency on where we think the Bill still requires amendment even at this late stage is that we are relying on the charitable sector to tell us what works and what might be a problem. As I said at the outset, we recognise that the Minister has listened and&#8212;to be fair&#8212;in some instances introduced further amendments, but I press the case again. He has been good enough to recognise some of the areas in the Bill that need improvement, and he would gain favour with the whole House and the charitable sector if he could recognise the remaining areas that could be further improved and, even at this late stage, accept some of the amendments. That would make the Bill even better. The review clauses would allow us to revisit areas that I suspect will cause charities the most difficulty. We want people to benefit, not lose out, from these measures, so I hope that he will accept at least some of our amendments.</p>

	<p pid="b.78.0/1">It is a privilege to speak in this debate. As hon. Members present at the time will know, we had some good, positive and, indeed, consensual discussions in Committee. Labour Members are keen to see the Bill passed, because we recognise that much of it is an extension of what previous Labour Governments did. That is why we want to get it 100% right. Things such as the compact for the voluntary sector and the immense growth and development of gift aid happened on Labour&#8217;s watch, and we are keen to see that trend continue in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/2">Certain groups will rightly be especially pleased with the Bill. It is fair to say that the dioceses, Churches and faith groups welcome the Bill, as do we, and it is right that we support those groups and the tremendous work they do in communities across the country. A range of other charitable groups will also benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/3">I am pleased with certain changes in the matching principle: I am not a betting person, but, on this occasion, 10:1 is clearly better than 2:1. Nevertheless, we are asking the Minister to listen to the voice of the national charities&#8217; voluntary organisation, the Institute of Fundraising, as well as the Charities Aid Foundation and other groups, which are saying, &#8220;If you are prepared to improve the Bill in certain ways, as you have been, please think again about having the link with gift aid, if we really want charities, including those not currently claiming gift aid, to benefit.&#8221; I urge the Minister to have at least a little think about that. He and the Government have gone some way towards accepting some of the changes that those groups wanted. Let us get it 100% right. I urge him to consider those other changes too.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/4">I want to look at the issue of reviewing the legislation, about which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> spoke with great eloquence. We know that many things in the Bill will work, but if the development of community and voluntary sector</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/5">groups over the last 10 to 20 years is anything to go by, we know too that fundraising has changed dramatically. What worked yesterday will not work today, and what will work tomorrow will probably not have worked today. It will change over time. That is why we ask the Minister to consider having a review.</p>
	<p pid="b.78.0/6">Mention has been made about the way donations are made, and I am confident that more mention will be made of it. What interests me is that if one made a &#163;10 cash donation, there could be benefits under this Bill, but not if the same donation were made on a mobile phone or with a bank card. As someone from generation X&#8212;I have not actually checked, but I think I am&#8212;that strikes me as a little odd, but let us think about the new donors we want to cultivate in generation Y, as I think it is called. If we are to build a new philanthropic culture that encourages younger and newer donors, we must at least be open on that point. I urge the Minister to look carefully at that provision, which I know has already been mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, and I know it will be mentioned later. I urge him to reconsider and to support the concept of an ongoing review so that future charities Ministers and other Ministers can look at this legislation and say, &#8220;Let us make it work for today&#8217;s generation.&#8221;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.79.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" speakername="Eilidh Whiteford" colnum="79"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0002.htm#12112627000646">
	<p pid="b.79.0/1">Let me begin by declaring an interest. Until relatively recently I was a trustee of two charities registered in Scotland and I remain a trustee of the Parliament Choir, which also has charitable status.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.0/2">I acknowledge the progress made on the Bill in Committee and the steps people have made across the House to come up with constructive solutions to the acknowledged weaknesses of the legislation in its original form. I hope the Minister will take on board some of this evening&#8217;s amendments, not least the two in my name in this group&#8212;amendment 32 and the consequential amendment 33. My amendments are designed to provide a mechanism to allow smaller and project-specific charities to benefit from gift aid top-up payments without having to have made a successful gift aid exemption claim in three of the last seven years, or two of the last four&#8212;I am conscious that the Government have tabled an amendment to improve that part of the legislation. For the sake of clarity and simplicity, I propose that a &#8220;small charity&#8221; be defined as one with a gross annual income of &#163;25,000 or less. As with other amendments in the group, the aim is to bring more small charities within the ambit of the legislation, which is a shared aim across the House this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.0/3">The reason I urge the Government to look closely at my amendments is simply that smaller charities often do not benefit from gift aid, and in some cases do not even register for it. The very charities that this Bill is intended to benefit are among those that are least likely to be registered for gift aid or to have claimed it regularly even when they are. As the proposals stand, an eligible charity has to have been registered with Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs for a minimum of three years, made a gift aid claim in three of the past seven years, and not had a penalty imposed in making a gift aid claim. We know that around 100,000 organisations are registered with HMRC for gift aid, but only 65,000 claim</p>
	<p pid="b.79.0/4">each year, which is a significant gap. They include not just general charities, but excepted charities, such as churches, exempt charities, such as museums and foundation schools, and community amateur sports clubs. At the moment, many small charities are not registered with HMRC and do not have a three-year track record of making gift aid claims, which particularly affects charities run solely by volunteers&#8212;those that do not have professional staff, including fundraisers, or the time and resources that other, more professionalised charities do. Such charities are often involved in the very projects that attract the largest active community involvement and support, which in my view are exactly the sorts of activities that we should use the Bill to incentivise in our civil society.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.0/5">Notwithstanding the proposal to decrease the three-year registration period, any time limit will mean that charities engaged in short-term or fixed-term fundraising will have little incentive to register for gift aid with a view to taking part in the new scheme. Whether it is fundraising to replace the windows in a listed community building or raising funds for special equipment for a disabled youngster, any one-off projects raising relatively modest sums of money over a short period will find it difficult and unduly cumbersome to benefit from the scheme. Even the Government amendments this evening will not meet the needs of short-term appeals. Indeed, charities that receive only cash donations and do not fundraise in other ways will have no opportunity to claim gift aid even if they would like to.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.0/6">Although I fully accept that any definition of a &#8220;small charity&#8221; will be to some extent arbitrary, I want to explain to the House why I have suggested &#163;25,000 as an income level and assure Members that I did not just pluck that number out of the air. It is already the threshold that the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator uses for the treatment of smaller charities in reporting and monitoring. There is a recognition that reporting and monitoring need to be commensurate with the size of an organisation, and the burden of compliance needs to be proportionate too. Charities with an income below &#163;25,000 per annum have to submit an annual return, but do not have to submit the supplementary monitoring returns and annual accounts required by larger organisations.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.0/7">Similarly, in England and Wales, the Charities Act 2011 contains numerous mentions of &#8220;lower-income charities&#8221;, which are for the most part&#8212;but not exclusively&#8212;defined as having a gross income of &#163;25,000 or lower. That definition is used to determine the requirements for auditing and annual reporting&#8212;for instance, in part 8 of the 2011 Act, which deals with charity accounts, reports and returns. As the registration of charities has not commenced in Northern Ireland, the situation is somewhat different there, but there are nevertheless distinctions drawn between very large and smaller charitable organisations. As the greatest risk that needs to be managed in this Bill is the potential for fraud, defining a &#8220;small charity&#8221; in a way that is consistent with the accountability practices and processes already in use by charity regulators would be a useful step forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.0/8">Before I conclude, I want to pick up a point that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> made about connected charities. As someone who represents a rural constituency, I absolutely concur</p>
	<p pid="b.79.0/9">with what was said earlier. In rural communities, the trustees of the local village hall will often be drawn from the trustees of the various groups that use it. There is every likelihood that the same people or their spouses will appear on the Kirk session, and they might well be on the school-parent council too. Therefore, the cohesiveness of those small communities&#8212;where some people are extremely active in a range of activities and where a lot of entertainment is very much home grown and home run&#8212;will potentially be affected. I urge the Minister to look carefully at how the Bill&#8217;s important safeguards will play out in remote rural communities, where such cohesiveness is still very much part of the fabric of daily life.</p>
	<p pid="b.79.0/10">To put this debate in context, 60% of all charities active in Scotland&#8212;around 14,000&#8212;have a gross annual income of less than &#163;25,000, with almost 9,000 having an income of under &#163;5,000 a year, more than 2,000 whose income is between &#163;5,000 and &#163;10,000, and just over 3,000 with a gross annual income of between &#163;10,000 and &#163;25,000. Those smaller charities represent a disproportionate number of charitable organisations, with 47% of all charities in Scotland&#8212;almost half&#8212;having a gross income of less than &#163;10,000 a year. Published information from the Charity Commission shows a similar picture in England. In June 2010, there were 73,000 registered charities in England and Wales with an income of less than &#163;10,000, representing 45% of the sector. Given those proportions, it is incumbent on all of us to look at how we can strengthen the Bill for the smallest charities and ensure that they are able to benefit from the legislation, as was originally intended. According to the National Audit Office, 67% of the charities across the UK generate only 1.4% of charitable income. Let us bear it in mind that the Bill is supposed to support those smaller charities. I urge the Government to look carefully at the amendments tabled by Members on the Opposition Benches, including amendment 32.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.81.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40649" speakername="Gemma Doyle" colnum="81"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0002.htm#12112627000647">
	<p pid="b.81.0/1">Charities are facing challenging circumstances, with falling financial support from the Government and falling regular donations as a result of the squeeze on people&#8217;s spending. This is a tough environment for any charity to work in. Furthermore, the reliance on the charitable and voluntary sector is increasing, as we are seeing from the number of food banks that are springing up and the greater reliance on homelessness services.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/2">We owe it to charities to help them out when we can, and I must admit that the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement of these proposals was one of the few parts of the Budget that I welcomed. Now that we have had a chance to look at the details, however, we see that there are still some outstanding issues. We will of course support the Bill on Third Reading, but I still have concerns about accessibility for many of the charities that could benefit most from it.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/3">Offering charities the chance to take advantage of a gift aid top-up is of course welcome. My constituency is facing a number of serious challenges, but we are fortunate to have a thriving charitable and voluntary sector that does much good work throughout the area. I am thinking of the small charities run by a handful of local volunteers, such Home from Home in Dumbarton, and the Clydebank Asbestos Group, which has a very wide reach but relies on a small team of dedicated volunteers, as well as the</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/4">slightly larger ones with some staff, such as Y Sort-It in Clydebank. They all contribute so much, working alongside the services offered by the local authorities to help with a range of issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/5">As I am sure other Members will recognise, it is often many of the smaller charities which are getting by on tiny incomes that help so much with the provision of local services. Many of them do not have steady income streams or the time and manpower&#8212;or, often, the womanpower&#8212;to administer complex donation rules. They rely on simple methods of fundraising, such as bring-and-buy sales and collecting donations in buckets on the street. Those small activities all add up.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/6">I am sure that, like me, many of those smaller charities will be pleased with the effect that the proposals could have on their incomes. They remain concerned, however, about the restrictions that could make them ineligible. The Government need to ensure that the rules will work for charities and not against them. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> has comprehensively set out, we need the Bill to help charities out, not to add to the burden of bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/7">Bureaucracy can be a headache for small charities. Compliance with the rules is essential&#8212;they are there for a reason&#8212;but they can pose real difficulties, particularly for the smaller charities. A Treasury spokesperson said the Government&#8217;s proposals were intended to reduce the administrative burden on charities, but I am not sure that that is what they will do. It is possible that the bigger charities, not the smaller ones, will benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/8">The Government&#8217;s amendments are helpful; they are heading in the right direction. The original proposals could have resulted in the smallest charities losing out the most, because placing so many conditions on the new top-up would have made it difficult for those charities to take advantage of the scheme. I am pleased that the Government seem to have recognised the problem with the three-year criterion, and that they are moving towards a two-year period instead. That will widen the benefits to include more charities. However, the proposals will still favour the larger charities that have a history of gift aid claims over the smaller ones that rely on bucket donations.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/9">Similarly, the Government&#8217;s amendments do not properly reflect the needs of newly established charities, which will naturally not have any history of gift aid claims. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase> said that her amendment would acknowledge the fact that, although many charities are proactive in their work, there are those that react to events. A charity might be set up to react to a natural disaster, for example; another might be set up in memory of a loved one. Newly established charities often receive a significant proportion of their donations at the very beginning, and their donations might subsequently tail off. Under the current proposals, they would not be able to claim top-up payments related to those important initial donations.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/10">Our amendments are intended to help those small and new charities by removing the lengthy start-up period and replacing it with a probationary period. That would provide a real benefit. It would allow all charities without a claims history, whether new or established, to benefit from the top-up scheme while keeping the protections in place. It is important to</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/11">have protections against fraud, but I believe that our proposed probationary period would be sufficient in that regard. I therefore encourage Members to support our amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/12">We need to ensure that we get the scheme right. The Government&#8217;s own &#8220;Giving&#8221; White Paper, published last year, made it clear that they wanted to work more with business and charities to make it &#8220;easier and more compelling&#8221; for people to give time and money, and so make the change that they want to see. Our amendments would make it much easier for the Government to meet their aims.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/13">New clauses 1 and 2 would ensure a proper review of the impact of the measures on access to the scheme. The charity and voluntary sector deserves to have the rules properly reviewed, with a report being laid before Parliament so that all Members can see how accessible the scheme is. I hope that, in the spirit of openness and transparency that the Government say they are in favour of, all Members will consider supporting the new clauses.</p>
	<p pid="b.81.0/14">The simple principle of giving charities the extra bit of help that is contained in the Bill is very much welcome, but the proposals could and should go further. As the Bill stands, thousands of small charities could lose out. Our amendments would take a few steps towards giving charities that extra support, and I hope that Members will support them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.83.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40264" speakername="Mark Durkan" colnum="83"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0002.htm#12112627000648">
	<p pid="b.83.0/1">As other hon. Members have already said, many practical concerns and suggestions were aired and shared by members of the four parties represented when we discussed the Bill in the Public Bill Committee. It is important that we use the Report stage to return to a number of those issues. I do not intend to rehearse all the arguments that were made in Committee. This is not the time for &#8220;Here are our best bits&#8221; or for simply making our pitches again. However, it is important to reflect on the fact that the Minister indicated that he was listening to some of the points that were made in Committee, even if he refuted many of the others. That is reflected in some of the Government amendments that he will no doubt speak to later. I welcome the fact that further progress has been made, just as I welcome the fact that, in Committee, the Minister tabled an amendment to clause 2 as a direct response to an issue that I had raised on Second Reading. I appreciate his doing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/2">There is still a basic problem with the Bill. The original Budget promise made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was widely welcomed across the House, and certainly in the charity sector. People expected something along the lines of what they thought had been promised&#8212;that the equivalent of gift aid would be available, with certain conditions, to charities, without them having to fulfil all the gift aid criteria and the necessary processes attached to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/3">As I said, that was widely welcomed, but the Government then produced a scheme that was absolutely dependent on gift aid; gift aid was the qualifying prerequisite. Even with the Government amendments so far and the further Government amendments tabled for debate today, the provisions are still locked into the requirement that gift aid is the prerequisite for qualifying for these top-up payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/4">In the Public Bill Committee, the Opposition Front-Bench team tabled various amendments aimed at trying to ensure that the scheme was not based on gift aid and not run by Her Majesty&#8217;s Revenue and Customs. I did not necessarily sympathise with those amendments. I could see the point of saying that if a scheme operates in the spirit of gift aid, the payments would be made by HMRC. However, I do not accept that the practice or use of gift aid by a charity should be the only way in which it should benefit from the sort of measure that I believe all hon. Members would want to see. That is why I have tabled new clause 3, a variant on provisions I proposed in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/5">The point of the new clause is to provide a route 2 option to allow smaller charities or newer charities to benefit from the same capacity that the Bill confers on larger and more established charities. It is about creating a second scheme whereby HMRC would be able to support charities and top up their donations to exactly the same limits and levels as would be available to the other charities; there would be no differentiation. However, these charities would not be caught by the obligation to have claimed gift aid in the previous three years&#8212;or the previous two years as proposed now, or eventually only one year if a review amendment is passed, and the review amendment locks in the fact that there has to be at least a previous tax year in which gift aid was claimed.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/6">New clause 3 is aimed at saying, &#8220;Let&#8217;s have a second scheme.&#8221; If the scheme provided is one of complementary gift aid where HMRC will complement all the gift aid payments with the other top-up payment, there should also be a supplementary top-up payment scheme for the smaller charities that do not use gift aid&#8212;and they might have their own reasons for not using it. Small local charities may depend on cash donations and may rely on school students to carry out a lot of their collections. In those situations, people are not going to register gift aid details. Many charities say that people avoid giving gift aid details nowadays, simply because they are afraid that it will generate an awful lot of demands through the post for all sorts of other donations if their details are passed on. It is not necessarily that people do not want to give gift aid; they sometimes do not think the amount involved is worth giving out their details for, or they are not sure what else that could lead to. Let us understand why many charities do not use gift aid nowadays and may not want to rely on or use it much in the future. When we are legislating for a scheme such as this, we need to realise that we are legislating as far as possible for all charities.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/7">Other hon. Members have made the point that many charities are created in response to particular events in a community. Those events could be a tragedy; they could have had a serious criminal impact on a community or the families within it; they could involve the impact of a natural disaster. Only this weekend, we saw the serious impact of flooding in many places. Are we really saying that we want to make sure that bona fide charities set up in response to such circumstances are the bodies that we specifically want to exclude from the scheme? Are we deliberately and specifically as legislators saying that they should not benefit from this sort of scheme? I think that as MPs we should be trying to ensure that such charities do benefit. In future, many of us may well write to Treasury and other Ministers on behalf of</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/8">those charities, asking for some extra statutory basis to be found to allow a particular charity to benefit. That is why I commend new clause 3 as one way of meeting Members&#8217; concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/9">If the Government fear extending the scheme to all charities because they will not be able properly to oversee, regulate, manage or verify it, we have to find a way of allowing the Government to cater for the other charities while ensuring that the scheme remains proofed against fraud. That is why new clause 3 provides that it is for HMRC to specify what other validation and verification it would need from these smaller and newer charities. It also allows HMRC to indicate which agencies can be involved, whether it be registered members of a particular professional body such as accountants or local authority figures. When charities are set up in response to particular events, it is often a mayor or a council chief executive who gets involved. The new clause also provides that in specifying who can be used to verify the charity&#8217;s details, HMRC will liaise with the relevant devolved authorities, charity regulators and charity commissioners. It might even rely on the police, because many of the small local charities that gather money in bucket collections do so on the basis of having secured a police licence or police approval, so why not join the dots and allow the police to be involved? Perhaps this is something for the police and crime commissioners to do, as nobody is quite sure what else they are going to do. They could be made part of the chain of communication and verification.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/10">New clause 3 is an attempt to help the Government extend the benefits of the Bill to even more charities than will qualify for and receive benefits under the current provisions. It is intended to reflect some of the issues raised by hon. Members on Second Reading and again in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/11">Will the Minister explain why there should not be two different routes of provision for charities, according to their scale, their size and their circumstances? He seemed to suggest in Committee that this would be a dangerous and difficult thing to do, but we often see the Treasury legislating and regulating differently in other areas according to size and scale. In the Financial Services Bill, for example, which is still stuck in the other place, the Government provide for different panels in respect of the whole matter of financial conduct. There is a markets practitioner panel and a small business panel, taking account of the fact that different people involved in financial services are operating on a different scale of business. There will also be the consumer panel. So there is differentiation, as there also is in respect of prudential regulation, financial conduct and so forth. If all those differences could be taken into account in the financial services industry, it seems strange that the Government say it is impossible for them to take account of working, practical, natural differences relating to the scale and circumstances of charities.</p>
	<p pid="b.83.0/12">Similarly, credit unions also come under financial regulation, and the Treasury is quite happy to base its regulation of credit unions on version 1 and version 2 credit unions. Versions 1 and 2 have different criteria and they quality for different benefits according to different capacities. I see no reason why there should not be a version 1 and a version 2 scheme for small charitable donations top-up payments. That is essentially what new clause 3 offers.</p>

	<p pid="b.86.0/1">Being a member of a Public Bill Committee, particularly a Back-Bench member, can be a soul-destroying experience. It often seems to Opposition Members&#8212;under all Governments, I am sure; I do not intend to suggest otherwise&#8212;that what happens is this: the Committee debates the amendments that we have tabled, the Government generally oppose them, in some instances there is a vote, the Opposition generally lose the vote unless the Government have been uncommonly careless in losing some of their members somewhere in the building, and we move on to the next debate. However, that is probably not what the public think is involved in the scrutiny of a Bill in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/2">When I became a member of the Committee, I wrote in my local newsletter that I was quite excited about it. Because the Bill did not appear to me to have created huge party political dividing lines, I believed that we would have the sort of opportunity for scrutiny that does not always arise. Unfortunately, however, there came a time when I began to feel that that was not the case, and that, for all my hopes that we would be open with one another about what was right and wrong with the Bill, we were merely engaging in those traditional Committee procedures. I was therefore extremely pleased to observe that the Minister, who had given little away in Committee, had tabled Government amendments on Report. That, I think, shows that he listened to what was said in Committee, and subsequently thought about difficulties that had been created during the drafting of the Bill but had not really been intended by legislators.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/3">We must surely acknowledge that returning the time for which a charity must have existed before it can even claim under the scheme to two years, as the Government amendment proposes, would be an improvement, although our new clause takes a rather different approach. At least the amendment recognises that charities, particularly new charities, need a great deal of help. However, part of the problem with the Bill has been the fact that it is so strongly hitched to the gift aid mechanism.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/4">It was assumed that small charities that could not obtain money through gift aid should be helped by means of the mechanism that already existed. That created a huge extra obstacle race. In fact, there will still be an obstacle race even if the Government amendments are accepted. The charity must be registered, it must have existed for a certain number of years&#8212;for the three years originally proposed, or for two&#8212;and it must be registered for gift aid. For all the reasons that have already been given, that can be quite a cumbersome process, particularly for small organisations that are entirely run by volunteers.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/5">The whole apparatus of gift aid is quite complex, and the original mechanism involved a fairly lengthy process. It seemed to us in Committee that very small charities in particular were being expected to jump through a huge number of hoops to make their claims. Ironically, it appeared that they would be faced with far more obstacles than larger organisations which were claiming substantial amounts of gift aid, and that a scheme that had been intended to benefit small organisations was unduly elaborate.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/6">It appears that the Government intend to retain the link with the gift aid arrangements, but I hope that there is still space for our proposals. New clause 3, for example, suggests a way of removing some of the</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/7">complexity from the system to allow start-ups of small and sometimes fairly short-term charities. It is a good idea to enable people to set up charities for a particular purpose and perhaps to close them down once they have had a dab at what they need to do. Perhaps we are rather too inclined to keep organisations going just for the sake of keeping them going, rather than saying, &#8220;It has done its job, and we can wind it up.&#8221; Sometimes that is the appropriate thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/8">I am pleased that the Government have tabled their important amendments, but I hope that, even at this stage, the Minister will be prepared to look kindly on the proposals presented from various parts of the Opposition Benches, including the new clauses proposing a review. It is often said of reviews, particularly by Governments, that it is unnecessary to demand them because they will take place in any event: because part of a Government&#8217;s activity is constantly to review what they are doing. That should indeed be the case, and one hopes that it is, but in reality there are many competing pressures. Many things have to be done, and time moves on.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/9">When a Bill such as this goes on to the statute book, at one level it is done and dusted, and it is pushed aside. Civil servants, and indeed Ministers&#8212;even Ministers in the same Government, although not necessarily&#8212;may not return to it regularly unless required to do so. Rather than waiting for a problem to arise, and for organisations to campaign for a review because the present system is not working, we should create a clear mechanism that cannot just survive the Government who produced the legislation, but survive future Governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/10">Various concerns have been expressed, particularly by those who need to make the legislation work, namely the charities themselves. They are doubtful about whether the Bill will deliver what has been promised. The Government have suggested that some of those concerns may be exaggerated, that many charities that apply for gift aid will find the process easier than they had thought, and that we should not be so depressing as to put off charities in our constituencies. Indeed, the Minister has encouraged us all to organise our own publicity, and to arrange events encouraging charities to apply. That is all very worthy, but if the concerns that have been expressed have some foundation, the best way of establishing the facts will be a process of regular review and report. I do not think that it is enough for Ministers to say, &#8220;It will be all right, because somewhere in the system reviews will be taking place anyway.&#8221; We could all come up with examples of circumstances in which reviews do not happen until something goes wrong, or a big campaign has to be organised to put pressure on a future Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.86.0/11">I hope that, now that the Minister has shown his willingness to move on the Bill, we shall see some further movement tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.87.0/1">I will start by reflecting on the Bill&#8217;s constructive Committee stage, and I thank the Opposition for their continuing support. I also thank the hon. Members for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore), for Clwyd South (Susan Elan Jones), for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford), for West Dunbartonshire (Gemma Doyle) and for Foyle (Mark Durkan) for their contributions to today&#8217;s debate. I will try to answer as many of the issues raised as I can.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/2">Proceedings in Committee, and now on Report, have provided an excellent challenge to and scrutiny of the legislation&#8212;as they should have done&#8212;and I hope it is</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/3">clear from the amendments that they have tabled that the Government have listened to hon. Members from across the House. The amendments in this group cover mainly the eligibility conditions for charities that wish to claim under the small donations scheme. New clauses 1 and 2 would have a wider effect, as they require HMRC to publish certain details about the scheme as a whole. Amendment 21 would require HMRC to publish details of the connected charities and community buildings rules. Government amendments 28 and 29 are minor and technical and simply change the Government Department to which powers in clauses 7 and 8 are given.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/4">In Committee we debated a variant of new clause 1 and the same text of new clause 2. I opposed the measures then, and I am afraid I shall oppose them again today, as I will amendment 21. As I explained in Committee, we need neither the new clauses nor amendment 21. We are already doing much of what they ask and it would not be a good use of civil servants&#8217; time to duplicate that work.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/5">Let me start with the annual report. As I said in Committee, HMRC publishes national statistics on the cost of various charitable tax reliefs three times each year. Once the gift aid small donations scheme is up and running, HMRC will include details of that in those national statistics. HMRC does not separately identify gift aid claims by types of organisation, regions of the UK, or their regulators. Those details are not published for gift aid claims and it would not be a good use of HMRC&#8217;s time to produce such information for this scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/6">HMRC does not collect information on whether a charity is exempt or excepted. Charities would have to provide that extra information, and HMRC would need to change its IT system to cater for that. Again, that cannot be a good use of resources for either charities or HMRC. HMRC does not publish details of fraud rates in particular schemes or tax reliefs, as that would be tantamount to advertising them to fraudsters. I therefore cannot commit to publishing such information. All information that HMRC can reasonably publish will be published, and interested Members will be able to find all relevant information on its website.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/7">New clause 2 would require a review of the scheme two years after the Act comes into force. As I said in Committee, the Government are committed to a review of the scheme three years after it has started. That will allow enough time for the scheme to get up and running, and for charities to learn about it and get used to claiming. Any less time than that, and the review would not be representative of the scheme. A two-year review would be premature, but it would be wrong to think that no one will look at the scheme for three years. HMRC engages with charities every day through its helpline, outreach and audit teams. It will listen to what charities are saying and look for ways to improve the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/8">HMRC&#8217;s charity tax forum has been discussing this scheme since it was announced in March 2011. The forum will share experiences of the scheme as it beds down, and identify areas for improvement. HMRC keeps all guidance under review and makes changes as necessary so that any issues raised can be responded to without having to wait for three years to pass.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/9">Amendment 21 would require the Treasury to carry out a separate review of the scheme in relation to the community buildings and connected charities rules. As</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/10">they currently stand, the community buildings and connected charities rules will affect only a few charities. For the vast majority who take advantage of the scheme, such rules will be irrelevant and can be ignored. Most charities are not connected with other charities, and do not operate within community buildings or collect more than &#163;5,000 in small cash donations.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/11">We will debate later more Opposition amendments on the community buildings and connected charities rules. The amendments would extend those rules&#8212;and their complexities&#8212;to a far larger number of charities. Whatever the outcome of that debate, I do not believe that amendment 21 is necessary. I have already said that we will review the scheme after three years, and that review will be wide-ranging and look at all aspects of the scheme. It seems unnecessary and wasteful to hold another review 12 months earlier to look at just a small part of the scheme; it would be better to review everything at the same time.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40301" name="Gareth Thomas">The hon. Member for Harrow West (Mr Thomas)</phrase> spent two Committee sittings setting out his concerns about HMRC, which he doubted would have enough resources to administer the scheme&#8212;if we go ahead with all these reviews and reports, he may well be right. I do not feel that the new clauses or amendment 21 are a necessary or effective use of public resources, and I therefore ask <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> not to press them.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/13">New clause 3 was tabled by the hon. Member for Foyle, and amendments 32 and 33 by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan. They are designed to support new and smaller charities and to mitigate the effects of a three-year eligibility period. I hope that hon. Members have noted the amendments that I tabled on eligibility requirements, and that my proposal to drop the eligibility period to two years goes some way to allaying their concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.87.0/14">We debated new clause 3 at length in Committee, but I am afraid the concerns that I raised still apply. HMRC would be expected to gather information from other agencies to check the credibility of small charities. That would place a significant administrative burden on it to verify each and every charity that applied through that route. HMRC would be required to make subjective judgments about whether a charity was in or out, and would be constantly at risk of a legal challenge to its decisions. The scheme would be impractical in operational terms and I ask the hon. Member for Foyle to consider not pursuing the new clause.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.0/1">The Minister suggests that under the new clause, HMRC would have to check with all sorts of other agencies, but the measure clearly states that HMRC can provide for a scheme to which charities may apply. It would be up to the charities to produce and submit the verifying information. It would not be HMRC&#8217;s duty to verify information with other charity regulators or anybody else; it would be up to the charity making the claim to produce the necessary evidence as laid down in the scheme.</p>

	<p pid="b.89.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that point. He sat on the Public Bill Committee and will understand from those debates&#8212;probably more than most Members in the Chamber today&#8212;the eligibility requirements. I know that he welcomes some of the</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/2">Government amendments, but the remaining eligibility requirements provide a degree of protection for the public purse, so that charities that make claims and use the benefits introduced by this Bill are those that HMRC has good reason to believe are using the measure in the right way, and there is protection against fraud. I have looked closely at his new clause, which he has tabled with the best of intentions, but it is not a change that we can afford to make at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/3">I turn to amendments 32 and 33, tabled by the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan. Again, I am afraid I cannot support them. They would allow certain charities&#8212; those with an annual income below &#163;25,000 and those set up for specific projects and events, such as she described&#8212;to claim top-up payments from the time when they were established without meeting any other eligibility requirements. I sympathise with the intention behind the amendments, but they would cost a lot of money&#8212;tens of millions of pounds.</p>
	<p pid="b.89.1/4">Most small charities starting up have an annual income well below &#163;25,000, and those set up in reaction to events such as disasters would also qualify for payments under the amendments, so nearly every new charity would qualify immediately. As I said, I sympathise with the intentions behind the amendments, but it is essential to have some eligibility requirements, otherwise the scheme will be wide open to fraudsters and the cost to the public purse will rocket.</p>

	<p pid="b.90.0/1">The charities in question would be registered with charity regulators on both sides of the border, and those are surely the bodies that decide whether their purposes are charitable. What benefit will the Bill bring to people raising money for a one-off or fixed-term good cause?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.90.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" speakername="Sajid Javid" colnum="90"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0003.htm#12112627000654">
	<p pid="b.90.1/1">The Bill is intended to complement gift aid, because the Government received many representations from charities that when they received cash donations, such as in bucket collections, they were unable to take the information necessary for gift aid, such as whether the individual was a taxpayer and their name, address and other information. The scheme is intended to address that. One-off charities, including those set up in response to a disaster, are worthy causes but do not fit into how we intend the scheme to complement gift aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/2">To answer the last part of the hon. Lady&#8217;s question, if a charity is created in response to a particular event or disaster, there is nothing to prevent it from registering for gift aid immediately and taking advantage of the gift aid provisions that already exist. If it stayed in existence for a number of years and therefore met the new eligibility criteria, it could also take advantage of what is available under the Bill. For the reasons that I have given, although she introduced her amendments with the best of intentions, I ask her kindly to consider not pressing them.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/3">Amendments 8 to 16 would abolish the three-year start-up period and allow charities that have made a gift aid claim in the previous year to claim under the scheme. The maximum donations that could be claimed on would be &#163;2,000, instead of &#163;5,000. Proposals for a reduced rate for new charities have been put forward several times, and I am afraid that I cannot support</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/4">them. Reducing the eligibility period to a year or less would increase costs, which would include a lot of costs caused by fraud. Requiring just one gift aid claim would leave the scheme open to unacceptable abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/5">The amendments would also make the scheme very complicated for some charities. Charities would need to know which other charities connected with them had claimed, and at which rate, because the rules would be different depending on those factors. The Government have listened to all the concerns that have been expressed about the eligibility rules, and we have put forward our own proposals. Our amendments are safe and affordable, and they will minimise complexity. I therefore ask Opposition Members not to press amendments 8 to 16.</p>
	<p pid="b.90.1/6">I turn to the amendments that I have tabled on eligibility. Amendments 24 to 27 will reduce the eligibility period for the scheme to two years, and amendment 31 will introduce a power to enable us to amend the criteria in future if necessary. The eligibility criteria have been a key issue raised by the charity sector throughout the development of the scheme, and by Members in our earlier debates. The sector has welcomed the amendments since I tabled them last week, and I hope that hon. Members will support them, too.</p>

	<p pid="b.91.0/1">Can my hon. Friend explain the logic of why amendment 31 will take away the Government&#8217;s power to amend the provision requiring a gift aid payment in a previous year, yet amendment 30, which we will come to later, will give them the power not to require any matching gift aid amount in the next year? The impact will be that a charity can make a claim without having any gift aid claims in the current year, but will have to have claimed at least a pound in the previous year. Is it not slightly perverse to table amendments with those two opposite intentions?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.91.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" speakername="Sajid Javid" colnum="91"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0003.htm#12112627000656">
	<p pid="b.91.1/1">I believe that they fit together, and I hope that the purpose of the Government amendments will become clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/2">Concerns were raised that the eligibility criteria in the Bill were too restrictive, that too many charities that did not already claim gift aid would be put off the scheme because it would take too long to become eligible, and that some short-lived charities would never reach eligibility. Balanced against those concerns is the fact that the Government have always been concerned to protect the scheme against fraud. I have looked again at where the balance lies between accessing the scheme and protecting it from people who would try to exploit and abuse it, and I have concluded that we can reduce the eligibility period to two years without undermining the integrity of the scheme. Eligibility for the scheme is defined by reference to successful gift aid claims made by a charity in the past, and I now propose that the minimum period should be set at two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/3">I shall explain in more detail what our amendments will do. Four factors will determine the eligibility of a charity or community amateur sports club for the scheme, as set out in clause 2. The first is the start-up period&#8212;the number of complete tax years for which a charity must have been established before it becomes eligible for the scheme. We are reducing that period from three years to</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/4">two years, so a charity or CASC will now be able to access the scheme a year earlier than was originally set out. The second and third elements are that a charity has to have made claims in two of the previous four years, and that there is a gap of no more than two complete tax years between the claims. The amendments will ensure that HMRC is guaranteed to see a minimum level of claiming activity by the charity or CASC in question, so that it can get to know that organisation and understand its ability to claim gift aid correctly.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/5">The fourth element is the impact of a penalty on eligibility. If a charity receives a penalty, it will be excluded from the scheme for the tax year in which it makes the claim and the following tax year. Originally, the charity would have been excluded for the following two years, but amendment 26 means that the exclusion will be for only one year following the year of the claim.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/6">That all adds up to a significantly more accessible scheme for new charities that have not claimed gift aid before, but we do not know exactly how the scheme will operate in practice. As I have said, we will review it after three years, when we might find that fraud rates are much higher or much lower than expected, so it is sensible to build flexibility into the Bill to amend the eligibility criteria in future. Many charities have asked the Government to do that. That power will enable us to vary the elements of the eligibility criteria up or down, depending on the evidence that we see on how the scheme operates and its susceptibility to fraud.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/7">Those four elements interact with each other, and with the matching criteria, to provide safeguards for the scheme. We want to build the maximum flexibility into the Bill by allowing each of those periods to be reduced, increased, removed or reinstated. Any use of that power would be through the affirmative procedure, so it would be consulted on and subject to debate in the House. However, we do not want flexibility to undermine the integrity of the scheme or its important link with gift aid, so the requirement for a charity to make a minimum number of gift aid claims over a set number of years will always remain.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/8">I now turn to the last set of amendments in this group. Since the Public Bill Committee, we have reassessed the distribution of powers to make secondary legislation in the Bill, some of which are conferred on the Treasury and some on HMRC. Broadly speaking, a power that changes the nature of the scheme in some way should be exercised by the Treasury. A power given to HMRC should be to allow the collection and management functions to be carried out correctly. The powers in the Bill are currently inconsistent with that approach, so we are introducing amendments 28 and 29 to change the powers in clauses 7 and 8. Those relate to running charitable activities in a community building and the definition of a community building. The powers are currently assigned to HMRC, but we now think it would be more appropriate to assign them to the Treasury. That is because they could be used to make significant changes to what is in or outside the scope of the rules. I hope that that helps explain why we have tabled those amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/9">I come now to my conclusion, Mr Deputy Speaker. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;] The conclusion is very popular. I do not consider that there is any need for statutory reviews of the scheme at 24 months, and neither is there a need to require HMRC to publish</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/10">certain data. There will be a full review of the scheme after three years, and HMRC will be publishing what data it has three times a year. New clauses 1 and 2, and amendment 21, would be wasteful and would require duplication of resource for no good reason. I therefore ask the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun not to press those to a Division, just as I ask other hon. Members not to press new clause 3, amendments 32 and 33, and amendments 8 to 16.</p>
	<p pid="b.91.1/11">I hope that hon. Members are comforted by the Government amendments that will reduce the three-year eligibility rules to two years. I am introducing a set of amendments that do what many charities and hon. Members have asked us to do, which is reduce the barriers to entry for this scheme and cut the eligibility period. I accept that some hon. Members wanted me to go further, but that would leave the scheme too exposed to fraud. These amendments represent an important concession by the Government, and I call on hon. Members from both sides of the House to support them. I am also introducing two technical amendments, Nos. 28 and 29. I commend the Government amendments to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.93.0/1">I will not take up much time. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Hear, hear.&#8221;] It is always great to be popular. The Minister has gone some way towards addressing the concerns we raised in the Public Bill Committee, but I feel it is important that we press new clause 1 to a Division.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.0/1">Again, I hope not to detain the House to any great extent. As the Minister will recall, we consistently pushed the Government to reconsider the matching principle in the Bill as we believed that it was too onerous for many small charities and would mean that many of them could not benefit from a scheme that was supposedly set up to help them.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.0/2">The Government amendments show that the Minister has bowed to the pressure not just from members of the Committee but from people in the charitable sector who had serious concerns about the impact of the measures from the very start. I will not repeat all the comments made by the different organisations over the course of our discussions about the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.97.0/3">We could of course continue to argue for the matching principle to be dropped completely and could make a case for that. However, given that the Government have seen fit to introduce changes that will take the ratio from 2:1 to 10:1, I think we should recognise that they have moved a significant amount, which has been welcomed by the sector. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say about his amendments and I want to make it clear that I do not think our amendments are required at this point as they have been superseded by his.</p>

	<p pid="b.97.1/1">I wholeheartedly agree with the hon. Lady. In Committee, the Minister promised to make the situation more generous, but last week I saw that no</p>
	<p pid="b.97.1/2">amendments had been tabled to that effect. I thought that I would just try to help him be a little more generous by reflecting the wishes of a local church in my constituency that had asked me to try to make the figure three times, not twice. I have no desire to be only a third as generous as the Treasury and so welcome this move by the Minister. I think that it is a sign that he has listened to the argument. I genuinely hope that this new-found generosity in the Treasury will extend into next week.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.98.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40128" speakername="Sajid Javid" colnum="98"  time="020:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0003.htm#12112635000202">
	<p pid="b.98.0/1">We have had a constructive and lively debate so far. I welcome the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> and, in particular, her decision not to press her amendments. I also welcome the comments of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40043" name="Nigel Mills">the Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase> and his decision not to press his amendment. He has recognised that Government amendment 23 will reduce the matching rate by 10%, which is even more generous than the reduction proposed in his amendment. I cannot promise him that this generosity will continue into next week&#8212;we will have to wait and see what happens then&#8212;but he does tempt me.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/2">I will say a few words about why the Government have brought forward these amendments. Although some hon. Members wanted to remove the matching rate altogether in Committee, I understand that they accept that the Government have listened and that a 10% rate is much more generous than what was offered when the Bill was first introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/3">Let me say explain why we have this matching provision. HMRC sees even the 10% rate as an act against gift aid fraud. Unfortunately, there are unscrupulous individuals who want to misuse charitable tax reliefs. They defraud the taxpayer and undermine the good name of the charitable sector, so we must be in a position to protect the taxpayer and the charitable sector. The lack of records also means that HMRC would have less evidence when a charity is claiming correctly under the scheme if there was no kind of matching principle. Gift aid is the closest proxy we can use to help ensure compliance under the new scheme, and the matching requirements will significantly increase protection against fraud and abuse.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/4">Government amendment 30 introduces a wide-ranging power that will allow us to reduce or increase the matching rate. It will allow us to remove the matching provision entirely or reinstate it at a later date if it is removed. Removing the matching provisions altogether would remove the need for charities to claim a set proportion of their small donations claim in gift aid in that year. Even so, charities would always need to claim some gift aid in each year to ensure that they can claim under the scheme. That is because of the provision in clause 1(1)(b). That helps to retain the important link between this scheme and gift aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/5">Any use of that power would be through the draft affirmative procedure, so it would be consulted on and subject to a debate in this House. That power means that the matching rule is fully flexible. We have no intention of using the power in the near future, but it will be there if we need it. It is something that many charities have asked us to introduce, so I am pleased that we have been able to do so. I believe that the</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/6">Government&#8217;s approach is better than some of the other amendments that have been tabled, as has been recognised in the comments we have heard.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/7">We debated the community buildings rules in some detail in Committee so, unless hon. Members have questions, I do not propose to go into much detail now, but I would like to remind Members that the purpose of those rules is to recognise that not all charities are structured in the same way. There are charities that, because of the way they were set up or for other reasons, effectively operate as branches of a master charity. We want to ensure that the proposals are as fair as possible and that branches of a bigger charity are effectively treated as individual charities and have their own &#163;5,000 limit. The purpose of the community buildings rules was not to give more than &#163;5,000 by allowing charities to have multiple claims, and I believe that the changes we are making to the Bill will achieve that effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.98.0/8">I again warmly welcome the support the House has shown for the Government amendments and thank the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun for looking at them carefully and not pressing her amendments. I commend amendments 23 and 30 to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.101.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" speakername="Eilidh Whiteford" colnum="101"  time="020:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0003.htm#12112635000206">
	<p pid="b.101.0/1">The last time the House debated the Bill, I raised the challenge of new ways of donating to charity. The purpose of the amendment is to take account of changes in the way people donate to charities, recognising the sea change that has occurred over the past 10 years or so in how they donate and the fact that people increasingly donate small amounts through text message giving. The technology driving us in that direction is developing rapidly. Conversely, and perhaps somewhat paradoxically, the amendment would also allow charities to benefit more from small donations made by cheque.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/2">The thinking behind the amendment is derived from work done by the Institute of Fundraising. In a previous life, when I worked in the charity sector, I worked closely with the institute and so pay tribute to the immensely valuable research it undertakes to understand how and why people support charities in order to promote good charity governance and support large and small voluntary sector organisations alike.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/3">The reality is that technological developments, especially with smart phones and tablets, mean that the number of electronic cashless donation options is growing. For instance, I am sure that many of us watched and donated to the BBC&#8217;s &#8220;Children in Need&#8221; appeal a couple of weeks ago, many of us doing so through text message donations. The use of mobile phones as cashless wallets is growing, and I think that the Bill would benefit by reflecting that. UK high street banks are already working on a mobile payments scheme to create a common infrastructure to link bank accounts to mobile phone numbers. That will help keep account details more secure, but it also heralds further changes in how we conduct transactions, including charitable donations.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/4">There are now more than 30 million contactless cash cards in circulation, contactless functionality is now available on an increasing number of mobile phones, and 68 national retailers are already live with contactless payments, including the Post Office, Marks and Spencer and W.H. Smith. There are 135,000 terminals across the UK where donations can be made. I have to confess that I personally have not yet caught up with this technology beyond automatic top-ups for my Oyster card. However, I am aware that the Cabinet Office is working with the National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts to explore the possibility of using Oyster cards for spontaneous charitable giving through the &#8220;Chip In&#8221; project. We should encourage</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/5">this kind of small electronic donation, as it has significant advantages over bucket-rattling. These donations are a lot more secure, they are significantly more auditable, and they are substantially less susceptible to fraud, particularly the small-scale fraud that has always been a risk associated with spontaneous cash donations. The upper limit of payments by contactless cash cards is currently &#163;20, which would potentially provide a nice compliance with the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/6">Another aspect is online transactions, which continue to grow. Between 2007 and 2012, the number of adults buying goods online increased by 9 million to 37.6 million &#8212;74% of the UK population. It would be valuable for the Bill more overtly to keep pace with these significant changes in behaviour. The Government&#8217;s impact assessment for the Bill suggests that current text giving systems make it easy to comply with the gift aid scheme, but I am not convinced that this is borne out by the evidence. Fundraisers say that only 20% to 25% of donors properly complete gift aid declarations for text donations, but some charities report that the figure is as low as 5%. That compares with 85% of sign-ups for online donations.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/7">The Institute of Fundraising points out that when a text donation has been made the provider usually sends a bounce-back text message with a link to a website page that the donor needs to visit to make a declaration. This is because the donor needs to complete their full name and address and to provide a declaration statement, which is a rather long thing to include in a text message. We do not have typical texting rates across the sector because providers do not give that information, but we do know that charities that have spoken out on the issue are concerned about the amount that they lose through people not completing this rather cumbersome bureaucratic process. Nevertheless, those forms of giving are auditable and would fit quite closely with the spirit of the Bill with regard to cash donations in recognising that, as time moves on, more and more of us are using different forms of contactless payments to make donations.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/8">JustTextGiving does not give people&#8217;s phone numbers to charities, so if someone does not respond to the initial text bounce-back there is no other way for the charity to get the donation, and declaration rates therefore remain very low. Where charities get the details, they will typically call the donor back if they have not had a response to the bounce-back. However, we have to bear in mind that if it is a mobile number, it might be a fairly expensive phone call, and if the donation has been only the &#163;1 that the donor would otherwise have thrown in the bucket, we have to measure the cost-effectiveness of that relative to the amount of gift aid that might come back. This only really works for higher value donations.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/9">In its evidence to the Committee, Camphill Scotland said that as a charitable organisation it frequently uses the newer methods of collection, and that it was keen that the Bill should start to explore the possibility of new ways of enabling donations by text messages. It went so far as to say that</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/10">&#8220;the Bill as drafted would either discriminate against those choosing to use this technology, or discourage charities from making use of this technology.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/11">My amendment&#8212;this is somewhat ironic&#8212;would also cover small donations made by cheque. Very often, cheque donations are made by donors who are already known to a charity, but cheques handed over at one-off fundraising events or plate collections at funerals, for</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/12">example, might not be so easy to identify, and it might not be worth the administrative costs of chasing up the donor. In some circumstances, filling in the gift aid declaration is a time-consuming process, and therefore not something that everyone will be able to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/13">Another reason why the amendment would strengthen the Bill is that younger people have different giving habits from other parts of the population. The Charities Aid Foundation, with Bristol university, commissioned a report entitled, &#8220;Mind the Gap&#8212;The growing generational divide in charitable giving&#8221;, published in September 2012, which identified a widening gap in giving between the over-60s and under-30s. Of course, many young people do give very generously to charity and are very involved in charitable activities, but a lower proportion of younger people are giving than older people. Making electronic giving more relevant and attractive could be one way to help to reverse this decline.</p>
	<p pid="b.101.0/14">Reputational risk is one of the greatest threats to charitable giving. A failure by one charity is felt by other charities in the same sector. While collection cans still have a valuable part to play and are a very effective means of raising money quickly, they carry an inherent susceptibility to fraud. Electronic giving diminishes the opportunity for money to go astray. It is a win-win situation. The amendment would strengthen the Bill, increase the benefits to charities, and help legislation to keep pace with the accelerating changes in technologies. I therefore commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.103.0/1">I support many of the points made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase>. I am trying to achieve a similar end result with amendment 2. Having recognised that the Government have some problems, I tried to find a way of future-proofing the Bill so that in a couple of years&#8217; time, when they saw the trend for cashless donation going beyond even what the hon. Lady set out, they could introduce an order to allow electronic donations to count for these purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.0/2">We have to be careful. The world is moving on. Only a few weeks ago, my credit card company sent me a strange thing that I can stick on the back of my mobile phone. Apparently, I can make payments with it. I have to say that I was not quite ready to go that far. I thought, &#8220;What happens if I lose my mobile phone? I will not only have lost all my contact details but my credit card as well.&#8221; However, we can see that this direction of travel is with us. I suspect that in many ways the Treasury is quite keen for us all to become even more cashless. Tax avoidance is made much harder if everyone starts to make payments by an electronic traceable means rather than through cash. The UK is the EU nation with the highest propensity to use cashless technologies, and I think that that trend will continue.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.0/3">In its evidence to the Committee, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution said that it was not yet ready to replace its cash collecting tins with electronic swiping points. I accept that. However, I suspect that in a few years&#8217; time that system will become rather more common and people will be out there with a placard saying, &#8220;Swipe your card here and donate a fiver to this charity.&#8221; We heard ideas about how people could swipe their Oyster cards to make small donations and how that</p>
	<p pid="b.103.0/4">might help Transport for London to get fundraisers off its stations. I gave the example of how an Oyster card that someone had finished using and that had some cash left on it could be used to donate to the Railway Children charity. At the moment, there is no way in which such a donation could be traced to see whether the donor was willing to give gift aid.</p>
	<p pid="b.103.0/5">The Minister argued in Committee that there is no need to take account of that type of giving because it is not that widely used and, where it is, it is still easier to get a gift aid declaration. I am not sure that that argument will stand firm in the next couple of years. We will start to move towards that type of giving and people will see it as an alternative to the quick cash donation. They will think, &#8220;I&#8217;ll swipe my card and give you &#163;1, &#163;2 or &#163;5, and I don&#8217;t fancy stopping to fill out a gift aid form any more than I do with cash. I don&#8217;t fancy having some e-mail come from my card provider saying, &#8216;If you click here you can have gift aid on that.&#8217;&#8221; We need to try to future-proof the Bill so that in two or three years&#8217; time we are not faced with charities moaning and saying, &#8220;Look, we&#8217;re getting more and more donations by some electronic means that we can&#8217;t use to claim gift aid. Can&#8217;t you change the Act?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.103.0/6">I have tried to find an easy compromise for the Minister and to assuage his concerns that this is perhaps too risky, not popular enough, or not needed. I suspect that it is quite unusual for a Back Bencher to offer a Minister the power to make a change in law by order. Usually Back Benchers&#8212;I am one of them&#8212;say, &#8220;I&#8217;m a bit concerned that the Government are taking too much power to change this, and we don&#8217;t want them to have that power.&#8221; Today, I am offering the Minister a power. He does not have to use it now, this year or next year, but at some point, if this became something that would help charities and fit with the aims of the scheme, he would have a nice simplified method of making the change without needing to come back to the House with primary legislation. He has already tabled amendments to give the Treasury powers to change things by order, and none of us had a problem with that. My amendment is a gentle, helpful one, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.104.0/1">Many of us who served on the Bill Committee or listened to the Second Reading debate and have heard the representations made by the charitable sector have a degree of sympathy with the comments made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40043" name="Nigel Mills">the hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase>, particularly in relation to ensuring that the Bill does not become out of date before it gets under way.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/2">The hon. Lady made some powerful arguments. Indeed, her case is reflected in our amendment 22, which relates to some of the difficulties involved in getting information from those who have made donations by means other than cheques, such as JustTextGiving, or&#8212;this issue was raised a number of times in Committee&#8212;if they have placed a cheque on a plate or in a collection box at an event such as a funeral.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/3">We had hoped that the Minister would give an indication&#8212;he may well do so&#8212;that he would at least be minded to consider this proposal at some point in the future. I understand that there may be technical reasons against that at present and that the Cabinet Office is engaged in ongoing work on the different</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/4">methods of making donations and on following up on gift aid. Although I support the principles of amendment 34 and want action to be taken&#8212;that is why we have tabled our own amendment on the issue&#8212;I understand that there may be some difficulties. It would be odd, however, if the Minister said that at no point would he consider moving in the direction suggested, particularly when the Cabinet Office is engaged in those schemes.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/5">I hope that the Minister will be able to comfort us by saying that he will consider the proposal at some stage. I also hope that the order-making powers that the Government will adopt under the Bill could, if necessary, be utilised at some stage to extend the way in which donations can be made. It seemed odd during Committee that, while someone can donate using whatever currency they choose, donations by electronic means do not count.</p>
	<p pid="b.104.0/6">I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say. I hope that he will take account of the persuasive case that has been made and that he will take a further look at the proposals in the amendments tabled by the hon. Lady and in my amendment 22.</p>

	<p pid="b.105.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> for her comments, and I also thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40043" name="Nigel Mills">the Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase> for their contributions. I will try to respond to their points, which they made very well.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/2">The amendments would do slightly different things, but, in general, they all seek to broaden the gift aid small donations scheme to include not only cash donations, but donations in the form of electronic payments. Amendment 2 seeks to do that by introducing a power to allow the Treasury, by order, to broaden the scheme, whereas amendment 22 and the group of amendments 34 to 37 seek to expand the scope of the scheme immediately. I thank my hon. Friend for his original amendment on the issue and for all his contributions on this particular topic in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/3">It might be worth reminding Members of the scheme&#8217;s primary objective, which is to provide a gift aid-style top-up payment when it is difficult or unduly burdensome to collect a gift aid declaration from the donor. The most obvious examples are when a charity is making a street collection or when a religious group is passing around a collection plate during a service. In such situations it would be difficult to ask everybody who makes a contribution to fill out a gift aid declaration form. They would have to stop, confirm they were a UK taxpayer and then fill in a form with their name, address and other details. I think we would all agree that that would be unrealistic for a donation of just a few pounds. As a result, charities are missing out on potential gift aid on such donations. That is exactly why the gift aid small donations scheme is being introduced&#8212;that is what it is designed to tackle. It will fill the gap in gift aid for donations for which it is difficult or unduly burdensome to collect the necessary paperwork.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/4">Giving by using digital technology means that the donor is already providing some or all of their details to the charity. If any extra information is needed to make a gift aid declaration, it will be relatively small. When a charity has an ongoing relationship with a donor, they should use gift aid, if at all possible. Compared with a</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/5">bucket collection on a busy street, it is considerably less burdensome to ask someone to provide their details if they are donating through a website or a text message. It is easy to use gift aid when making a donation through a website and it is also possible to attach gift aid donations to a text message.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/6">I want to sound a note of caution about complexity. Text messages and internet donations can be made from anywhere in the world, but I hope Members will agree that the UK Government should not make a top-up payment on donations made from outside the UK unless there is firm evidence that the donor is a UK taxpayer or resident. Introducing other forms of giving to the small donations scheme would make it more complicated. In order to make a top-up payment on UK donations only, charities would need to keep records of the donation&#8217;s origin. That is comparatively straightforward when rattling a tin on a UK high street, but it would become much more burdensome, if not impossible, for some charities if donations were made through texts and website visits from around the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/7">Hon. Members mentioned the possibility of making the gift aid system easier via text giving. The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun will be aware that the Government are in discussions with a number of charities and their representative organisations about how we can do just that. The discussions are going very well and have been constructive. The Government are open to the possibility that, eventually, we might have to pass legislation to make the gift aid system easier and we are working with charities to try to achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/8">It is possible that new forms of electronic giving will be developed in the future that are completely anonymous. Indeed, my hon. Friend mentioned the possibility of using Oyster cards, which are anonymous. It is very early at this stage, however, to understand what technology might come along in a few years&#8217; time, so it would be difficult to set out the circumstances in which the power he proposed could be used. Without complete knowledge of Oyster cards or other developing technologies for giving, it is difficult to know whether they would fall under the scheme&#8217;s scope and rationale. It is, therefore, possible that the power could never be used.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/9">I understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s concerns and he has made some important points, so I want a review of the forms of giving to be undertaken when we review the scheme after its first three years. If people are able to make completely anonymous electronic donations, we shall look again at whether the scope of the scheme should be extended. That is the Government&#8217;s commitment.</p>
	<p pid="b.105.0/10">It is harder for charities to collect gift aid declarations in the street or at a religious meeting than through other channels. That is why the focus of the scheme is on cash donations. I accept that things may change, so I am committing the Government to review the situation after three years. I therefore ask hon. Members not to press their amendments to a Division.</p>

	<p pid="b.106.0/1">Madam Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you will be as pleased as other Members to hear that I do not intend to detain the House for long.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/2">We have heard a few contributions on this group of amendments. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40043" name="Nigel Mills">The hon. Member for Amber Valley (Nigel Mills)</phrase> was on the same page as me in looking to the future and in considering ways of giving that are already</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/3">developing in the charitable sector. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">The hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> alluded to some of the technical challenges that the proposals might meet and pressed the Minister on amendment 22, which she tabled.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/4">I have listened carefully to the Minister and heard his commitment to review the forms of giving after three years. I am sorry that he did not go further, but I do not intend to press the amendment on the basis that there will be an opportunity for the &#8220;Chip-in&#8221; pilot scheme to be evaluated. I suspect that the technology will have moved far beyond that by the time of the review. I urge him to recognise the technological advances in giving that have already taken place.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/5">Making a &#163;1 text donation is like throwing a pound in a bucket. That is how we will give in the future. It will provide a better way for charities to create an audit trail. We do not know whether the people who give to someone who is shaking a bucket are taxpayers. Many of them may not be for one reason or another, whether they be pensioners or overseas students. In the same way, people making text donations may or may not be taxpayers, but I am sure that it is not beyond the wit of humanity to work out where the phones are or where the numbers are registered. Just as we are allowing this scheme to work in a proportionate way for cash donations that are collected in a bucket, we should respect the spirit of the Bill for contactless payments.</p>
	<p pid="b.106.0/6">I look forward to the review in three years and hope that the Minister will take those points on board. I beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="b.107.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">It is a pleasure to move the Third Reading of the Bill. It has been many months in development through consultation, drafting and a fair amount of discussion in Parliament. In a way, I am sad to say goodbye as it heads off to another place, subject of course to Members&#8217; support for its Third Reading.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/3">I am sure that everyone will agree that the Bill leaves the Commons in good shape. We have considered a lot of amendments and the Government have introduced amendments where we have agreed that there was room for improvement. Not only have we introduced the amendments that Members have accepted today on reducing the eligibility period to two years and lowering the matching rate to 10%, but we were active in Committee as well. We have listened to the concerns of charities and Members, and have brought forward a number of amendments to reflect them.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/4">I am pleased that the Bill has reached this stage and that we are able to move towards the introduction of the gift aid small donations scheme, for which the Bill provides the legislative framework. The scheme was announced as part of a significant package of measures in Budget 2011 to encourage charitable giving and philanthropy by donors from all walks of life, from the largest donors to those who give small amounts to charity bucket collections.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/5">The gift aid small donations scheme is at the heart of that package. Its purpose is to enable charities and community amateur sports clubs to claim a gift aid-style payment on small donations of up to &#163;20, for which it is often difficult to obtain a gift aid declaration. Eligible charities and CASCs will be able to claim top-up payments on up to &#163;5,000 of small donations each year. The scheme does not require individual donors to complete a gift aid declaration, nor does it require the charity or CASC to collect and provide the donor&#8217;s details with their repayment claim, as under gift aid. The aim of the scheme is to complement gift aid, not to replace it. It is for donations for which a gift aid declaration is too difficult to collect.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/6">Tax reliefs for charities and charitable giving are an important source of income for charities, totalling more than &#163;3 billion a year. Gift aid is the single largest relief and is worth more than &#163;1 billion a year to charities. We estimate that the gift aid small donations scheme could result in additional Government funding of about &#163;100 million a year for charities and CASCs. That represents a significant boost in income for the sector and will be especially valuable to smaller charities.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/7">We have worked closely with the charitable sector to try to get the scheme right. Concerns have been raised on the details of the Bill, and we have debated those points throughout the Bill&#8217;s different parliamentary stages. In developing the scheme, we have had to ensure that it operates as fairly as possible, but we have also had to ensure that it remains affordable and protected against fraud. We want the money to go to real charities that do good work, and not to fraudsters and others who would try to abuse the scheme.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/8">That is why we have introduced safeguards&#8212;the community buildings rule is one such feature of the Bill. We want to ensure that charities that do similar work at a local level but have different historical structures get allowances under the scheme that are not hundreds or even thousands of times different from one another. That is why we have introduced the community buildings rule. The charity sector has raised concerns about the complexity of the rule. It is true that, to obtain a simple result, we have needed to introduce detailed rules, but I am sure hon. Members will agree that that is preferable to disadvantaging some charities just because of how they have been set up.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/9">In conclusion, the Bill represents a potentially significant new opportunity for charities and CASCs. When it is up and running, it will give them a new stream of income and provide &#163;100 million of new funding to the sector. It therefore represents an important part of our strategy to support charitable giving across the board.</p>
	<p pid="b.107.0/10">I thank the Opposition and Members on both sides of the House for their support of the Bill, and for the constructive way in which they have scrutinised it. Together, we have improved the Bill. I hope hon. Members join in me in supporting this important new scheme and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.108.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" colnum="108"  time="020:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0003.htm#12112635000212">
	<p pid="b.108.0/1">As the Minister has indicated, this is an important Bill. I hope the Opposition have delivered on what we undertook to do on Second Reading, in Committee and on Report. At the outset, we said that we would attempt to ensure that the Bill came out of the</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/2">process in better shape, doing more to support charities than the original Bill. I do not say that to be critical of the Bill as it was introduced. The Minister came into things at that stage. He has since listened to a number of the points we have raised and introduced appropriate amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/3">The Minister said that he was sad to say goodbye to the Bill. Perhaps all members of the Bill Committee were sad when the Bill moved on. There was much agreement across the different political parties in our debates. We did not always agree&#8212;we sometimes split on party lines and we were disappointed that some of our amendments were not accepted in Committee&#8212;but we can safely say that the Bill is in better shape as it leaves the Commons. More charities will benefit more from the Bill as a result of the scrutiny. The fact that charities will benefit from an additional &#163;100 million per annum is positive. The Minister and his team have a responsibility to ensure that the uptake is such that every penny of that money ends up in the coffers of charities and CASCs, which is where he intends it to end up&#8212;it is worth emphasising that CASCs will benefit, because we have not spoken about that in great detail and it is none the less important. The Opposition were concerned at different stages that the Minister was focused more on the potential for fraud than on the potential for take-up. We are therefore pleased at the amendments that have been made tonight. They enhance the opportunity for charities to use the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/4">I noted that the Minister gave <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase> a strong assurance on a review. It would be churlish of me to say that I wish that some other areas would be reviewed, and I will do my best to remain positive at this stage. I welcome that commitment and I am sure that the Minister will be as good as his word when he says that all aspects of the Bill will be reviewed in order to ensure that any changes that can be made to assist charities will be undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/5">The Bill also saw the trying of new ways to deal with legislation as it goes through Parliament. For example, explanatory statements on all the amendments were included, which was helpful to the Opposition in unlocking some of the language with which the parliamentary draftsmen deal daily. It certainly put the onus on the Opposition to ensure that we were clear about the purpose of the amendments that we tabled, so that we could summarise it in 50 words&#8212;no bad thing. We also had the public reading stage and the consultation. It took a little time to get that consultation going, and the website was perhaps not as clear or accessible as it might have been, but I am sure the Minister will want to look at that and provide feedback for colleagues in the Cabinet Office. We eventually got a lot of very good information from organisations through that process.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/6">Several bodies engaged with us on the Bill and helped us to scrutinise it effectively and properly. They also supplied the information that we needed to table various amendments. They included the Institute of Fundraising, the Charity Finance Group, the National Council for Voluntary Organisations and the Law Society of Scotland. They all gave us information and campaigned tirelessly on behalf of the constituent organisations that they represent and of the charity sector. The Charities Aid Foundation, the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action and the Foundation for Social Improvement also provided invaluable help, support</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/7">and advice at various stages. Notwithstanding the efforts that the Opposition have made, the Bill is undoubtedly a better one as it leaves this place because of the input of those organisations and their commitment to do the best that they can for the charitable sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/8">This is a very important Bill. It may have seemed a small Bill, but we gave it thorough scrutiny in Committee&#8212;perhaps more scrutiny than the Minister would have liked on some points of detail. As the Bill leaves this place, we can be assured that we have done our best in making representations. The Bill will make a difference to charities and perhaps changes will be made after the three-year review. I certainly hope that we will continue to look at what additional support we can give.</p>
	<p pid="b.108.0/9">I thank people for their work in Committee, including the Chairs, the officials and everyone else who gave us inspiration and comments at various stages. All of the organisations in the charity sector and those who will benefit in the future will be glad of the amount of effort that has been put into the Bill. I am happy to support Third Reading and to join the Minister in commending it to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.110.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" speakername="Sheila Gilmore" colnum="110"  time="020:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0003.htm#12112635000213">
	<p pid="b.110.0/1">The process of the Bill from start to finish, including the pre-legislative stage&#8212;as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> mentioned&#8212;was very important. It is good to see that things can change. We sometimes become very rigid in this place&#8212;people take up positions and then cannot dig themselves out very easily without feeling a loss of face. A lot of improvements have been made, although some issues remain. The following may or may not prove to be the case; we will see how it works out in practice. During the pre-legislative scrutiny we attempted to grapple with the imbalance between organisations, whether national or regional in scope, which operate in such a way that each of their branches is a separate charity, and those which do not operate as a separate charity. Clearly, the Government listened to the concerns expressed, particularly by some churches, and made important changes. The by-product is a remaining complexity and an obstacle for organisations that cannot quite fit themselves into the model that has been adopted.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/2">I hope that the ongoing review that the Minister at various times assured us will take place&#8212;regardless of whether there is a formal review built in for certain parts of the Bill&#8212;will look carefully at whether that model can be modified. It is genuinely difficult for some organisations to meet the requirements on where the money has to be collected and the reference to community buildings&#8212;linking not only where the collection takes place, but where the charitable activity takes place. There are numerous examples of organisations that do not fit into the model that has been adopted. It clearly fits the church model, where the charitable purpose takes place at precisely the same time as the donations&#8212;the collection&#8212;but constituent elements or branches of other charities that cannot fit that model may still be unable to take advantage of the provisions, even though they are collecting money and making exactly the kind of efforts that the Bill is designed to encourage.</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/3">Even though Opposition amendments and our suggestion of a clear review process have not been accepted by the Government&#8212;of course, it depends on what happens to the Bill in the other place; further</p>
	<p pid="b.110.0/4">amendments and suggestions may be made about how some obstacles could be smoothed further and ironed out&#8212;I hope that some of these issues will be looked at in coming years to ensure that the Bill does what we all say we want it to do and allows small charities, which take fairly low levels of collections that are critical to their operation, to be able to take advantage of it.</p>

	<p pid="b.111.0/1">I have been following the Bill with great interest, as have my constituents. It is a pleasure to be here for the Third Reading of one of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government&#8217;s most progressive measures. I look forward to its being passed from this House imminently.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/2">The most generous people are often those with the least means. If we look at the income distribution of people who give charitable donations, we see that those who give the largest proportion of their income are the poorest. It is unfair that those who are the richest should get the biggest tax break, as it were, in the Government top-up on their donation through gift aid and by the myriad other schemes that we have discussed in this Chamber in the past year, and that people who might give &#163;20 or &#163;15, which would be much more than &#163;50,000 to a rich person, should receive less of an advantage. The Bill, therefore, is a progressive and forward-looking reform of tax legislation, which will help give the same benefit to people who give little amounts of money, which for them is a great deal, as to those who might give a lot and not think so greatly about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/3">The Bill is not just good for small donors; it is also good for small charities. In all our constituencies, the people who really pull our communities together are those in the small charities, whether they be churches or charitable groups looking after the disabled, the sick or children. The Bill will make a real difference to those charities, not only because they will get more money from the Government, but because it will help bind them to their donors and, importantly, facilitate the sense of community that arises when people give what they can both in time and small amounts of money. It will help to build communities and make them better places. For that reason, I support the Third Reading of this fantastic Bill put forward by Her Majesty&#8217;s Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/4" class="italic">Question put and agreed  <i>to</i> .</p>
	<p pid="b.111.0/5" class="italic">Bill accordingly read the Third time and passed.</p>

	<p pid="b.113.2/1">Each year, <phrase class="date" code="2012-11-19">19 November</phrase> marks world toilet day. While that might, at first hearing, sound rather comical, the issue it seeks to highlight is extremely serious&#8212;that of the continued lack of access to basic sanitation for about one third of the world&#8217;s population&#8212;and it was to mark that event and highlight again this important issue in Parliament that I sought this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/2">I acknowledge the work that the Government have been doing as part of the UK&#8217;s overall international development agenda, and I will refer to that further later, but water and sanitation still suffers from a lack of overall priority in political and investment terms, both nationally and internationally, compared with other aid portfolios, such as health and education, despite the fact that it impacts heavily on the achievement of other development objectives. The former Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, has noted that</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/3">&#8220;no other issue suffers such disparity between its human importance and its political priority.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/4">Clearly, without access to water, sanitation and hygiene, the progress that can be achieved in other areas is significantly constrained. The importance of access to clean water and sanitation cannot be understated. In the UK, the biggest step change in public health and mortality rates came as a result not of medical advances but of widened access to clean drinking water and adequate sanitation. During the late 19th century, as both water and sewerage infrastructure expanded dramatically, the life expectancy of an average member of the population in this country rose by 15 years&#8212;a remarkable increase delivered over a relatively short period. Indeed, the British Medical Association has recognised the commissioning of the sewerage system in London as the most important breakthrough in public health&#8212;of more significance even than the discovery of penicillin or the development of vaccines.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/5">As a direct result of poor or non-existent sanitation infrastructure, people&#8212;the majority of them children&#8212;are dying of diseases that, with the provision of potable water and sustainable sanitation, are preventable. In fact, they could be almost entirely eliminated. By way of illustration, I point to the fact that the biggest killer of children under five in sub-Saharan Africa, and the second-biggest killer globally, are diarrhoeal diseases, the vast majority of which are entirely preventable conditions caused by inadequate sanitation and hygiene. More children under five die annually as a result of these diseases than from HIV/AIDS, malaria and measles combined. Indeed, the disease burden of malaria itself is also impacted on by the availability of open drainage channels and sewers, providing environments conducive to the breeding of mosquitoes that spread the disease.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/6">Every day 2,000 mothers lose a child due to an illness caused solely by poor sanitation and dirty water. Even vaccines that hold out the hope of progress are less effective in the absence of WASH. But the impact of inadequate sanitation infrastructure is not limited to disease; it extends to the one in three women worldwide who risk shame, harassment and even physical attack simply seeking somewhere to defecate. This debate is</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/7">timely, then, not only in the context of world toilet day but because yesterday marked the international day for the elimination of violence against women.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/8">I want to draw on the everyday ordeal that the lack of access to sanitation is for people, especially women, who are the most acutely affected. Globally, 2.6 billion people lack access to basic sanitation, 1.25 billion of them women&#8212;one in three women in the world lack access to safe sanitation. Put simply, privacy, modesty, cleanliness and safety are almost impossible for those who have no access to sanitation facilities. Their experience often involves trading those factors against each other simply to survive. The reality is often shame, indignity, disease and even violence.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/9">Some 526 million girls and women are without access to any form of sanitation. They are forced to defecate in bushes or ditches, or even in the open, their choice being between doing so in broad daylight, compromising their modesty and risking shame, or waiting until dark to cling to their dignity but risk their personal safety. A 2005 UN development programme report confirmed that the need to travel further from home to secure the family&#8217;s water can expose women and girls to sexual harassment and rape, which can also happen when women who lack safe nearby sanitation move about at night in search of privacy. It is estimated that women and girls in developing countries spend 97 billion hours each year searching for a place to go to the toilet&#8212;more than double the total hours worked every year by the entire UK labour force. An 18-year-old mother from Mozambique has described her arduous journey each day to defecate in the bush. Her ordeal involves crossing a dangerous bridge that has claimed the lives of many people who have fallen through it. Sometimes she feels so ashamed that she returns home without being able to reach the point she needs to reach, or she waits until dark to go, so that no one will see her. However, at night the journey is even more dangerous. A woman and a boy have been stabbed to death on that bridge, and one woman she knows of has been raped on the journey.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/10">Even where public latrines are available, provision is rarely adequate. In the Kifumbira slum in Kampala, there are only four toilets for every 2,000 people, these consisting merely of holes into a cesspit, covered in faeces and maggots. Women worldwide have reported incidents of men hiding in public latrines at night, waiting to rob or assault those who enter them. In two slum districts in India, women reported incidents of girls under 10 being raped while on their way to use public toilets. In work carried out by WaterAid in Bhopal in India, 94% of the women interviewed said they had faced violence or harassment when going in search of a toilet, and more than a third had been physically assaulted. Amnesty International has also reported that women and girls in the slums of Nairobi were staying away from communal toilet facilities at night because of their fear of physical violence and rape. A WaterAid poll of women in Lagos in Nigeria revealed that 67% of women interviewed said they did not feel safe using a shared or community toilet in a public place.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/11">The only alternative for those women&#8212;if it could be called that&#8212;is to defecate at home. However, that too carries huge health risks and social consequences. One woman living in Kampala in Uganda has said that</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/12">&#8220;when someone knows you defecate in your house, your household is hated and people&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/13">will not visit. In addition to the stigma attached to this choice, resorting to so-called &#8220;flying toilets&#8221;&#8212;plastic bags or buckets used at home&#8212;carries significant health risks, not only for the woman but for her family, as storing and disposing of waste and maintaining even basic hygiene is almost impossible. Women are more susceptible to urinary tract infections and dehydration by trying to limit going to the bathroom for long periods and drinking less water over the course of the day, and as a result are more likely to become seriously ill.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/14">Further, as women are generally responsible for the disposal of human waste when provision is inadequate and for caring for others in the family who are affected by communicable hygiene-related diseases, they are more exposed to diseases such as dysentery and cholera than their male counterparts. This caring role and enhanced risk of contracting disease significantly restricts the degree to which women can be economically active and financially independent, and provide for the most basic needs of their family. That compounds the effect that a lack of provision of proper and private sanitation facilities has on girls&#8217; ability to access education, particularly as they reach puberty.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/15">Having outlined the problem, I want to turn my attention in the time remaining to the progress being made towards achieving millennium development goal 7, target 10&#8212;halving the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and improved sanitation by 2015. Although we have met the target of halving the proportion of people without access to improved sources of water, the sanitation target is significantly off track. At the current rate of progress, it will be over 25 years before south Asia meets its sanitation MDG target and 70 years to achieve universal access. Even more starkly, it will be the 23rd century before sub-Saharan Africa meets its sanitation MDG target and 350 years before universal access is achieved. The failure to meet the water and sanitation target threatens the progress of many other millennium development goals and undermines wider development efforts. Without water and sanitation, nothing else really works.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/16">I welcomed the UK Government&#8217;s commitment in April 2012 to double, to 60 million, the number of people whom they plan to reach with water, sanitation and hygiene promotion by 2015. I remain concerned, however, at the lack of clarity as to how the Government intend to ensure that that commitment will effectively target the areas and the people in the greatest need and as to how DFID will effect delivery on this scale through DFID&#8217;s current WASH budget.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/17">Good governance and stewardship of international assistance by foreign Governments also remains a challenge to the effective implementation of the Government&#8217;s plans&#8212;a matter to which I am sensitive. For example, the freezing of international assistance to Uganda due to the risk of corruption will mean that people living in the slums of Kampala who have benefited from DFID projects will see no further improvement in their circumstances in the short term. Urgent consideration must therefore be given to how the most needy can be targeted on the ground, even in the most volatile and unstable regions, and to how this increased commitment can be accompanied by an increased number of advisers</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/18">dedicated to WASH, in order to maximise the impact and value for money of WASH sector support. I believe that the UK should take the lead on this issue, encouraging multilateral partners&#8212;particularly the World Bank, the European Community and the African Development Bank&#8212;to increase investment and to better target WASH investments.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/19">I believe that this is the time to give consideration to how the current trends will be addressed after the millennium development goals have expired in 2015. If present trends continue, 2.4 billion people will still lack access to safe sanitation facilities in 2015, so it is imperative to construct a post-2015 goal framework to include a commitment to universal access to basic water and sanitation services, including a specific target date of 2030. I also believe that post-2015 goals should better reflect the central importance of WASH to human health, education, welfare, economic productivity and gender equality, as well as reflecting the interdependence of those goals. Water, sanitation and hygiene targets and indicators must focus explicitly on reducing inequalities by targeting resources at poor and disadvantaged groups as a top priority.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/20">The United Nations human development report estimates that for every &#163;1 invested in this sector, &#163;8 is returned in saved time, increased productivity and reduced health costs. It is therefore a wise investment as well as a necessary one, and its impact can be multiplied if the Government also collaborate with non-governmental organisations and charities, as well as with Governments, who can assist in providing education to local communities through church and community networks and supporting increased capacity among state and non-state players.</p>
	<p pid="b.113.2/21">I therefore urge the Department for International Development to outline how it will achieve its commitment to improve WASH for 60 million people in its budget, how it will ensure that the neediest can be prioritised, even in volatile and difficult countries, and how it will take the lead in framing the goals for the post-2015 agenda and ensure that a goal for universal access to basic water and sanitation services remains a key priority.</p>

	<p pid="b.116.2/1">I speak as the co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on child health and vaccine preventable diseases. The other co-chair is Lord Avebury. I tabled an early-day motion recently on this subject, and it now has quite a number of signatures. I am also vice-chairman of the Council of Europe public health committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/2">Diarrhoea is the most common cause of childhood illness and kills about 760,000 children each year. Around 90% of those deaths are caused by a lack of access to safe water, adequate sanitation and hygiene. Those deaths are preventable. Vaccines against rotavirus, the most common and severe diarrhoea in children, are critical, and their availability is a major development in public</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/3">health. However, those vaccines should not be seen as a silver bullet for tackling diarrhoea; nor can they address the other health impacts of a lack of sanitation.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/4">Reducing deaths from the top killers of children requires the prioritisation of interventions across different sectors, including health, nutrition, hygiene, water and sanitation. We must apply the package of prevention and treatment solutions that we know to be effective, and this must be built on solid collaboration between health systems and the water and sanitation sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/5">This was reinforced last year when I visited health care facilities in Bangladesh and Kenya, where we were launching a programme of vaccination. I witnessed extremely successful vaccination programmes in both countries, which were helping to protect children against terrible diseases such as pneumonia. During my visit, however, I was struck by the poor levels of basic sanitation and access to clean water at many of the health care facilities we visited. This emphasised to me how important it is to ensure that preventive measures such as vaccines are coupled with improvements in sanitation and access to clean water.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/6">I also saw on these visits small wards packed with up to 25 children, with the mothers in the same ward. I saw three babies in one incubator, and I saw a single oxygen cylinder with five or six lines coming out of it. It is all the basic stuff that is missing there. The vaccination was great&#8212;it is absolutely superb&#8212;and the efforts of the medics and nursing staff in each of these hospitals was just brilliant. The common basic hygiene and sanitation, however, are just not there.</p>
	<p pid="b.116.2/7">It so happens that I will be in Geneva tomorrow with the Earl of Dundee, who is the chairman of my Council of Europe committee. We are going to be in discussions with the World Health Organisation, UNESCO and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation. The issue of sanitation is one that we want to raise, because this is a global problem that needs to be tackled globally. I wanted to make only a short contribution; I will be interested to hear the Minister&#8217;s response.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.117.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40515" speakername="Alan Duncan" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Department for International Development"  colnum="117"  time="021:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0003.htm#12112635000221">
	<p pid="b.117.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40068" name="Naomi Long">the hon. Member for Belfast East (Naomi Long)</phrase>for calling what I think is the second debate this year on this important issue. Making progress on the appalling world statistics on access to sanitation is vital to the health and well-being of poor people. I commend the hon. Lady for her efforts on this topic. If I may put it this way, I think she has become one of Parliaments supreme champions&#8212;if not Parliament&#8217;s main champion&#8212;on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/2">It is truly shocking that in 2010, 2.5 billion people&#8212;nearly 40% of the global population&#8212;remained without access to the improved sanitation that would have protected their health. Even more shocking is the fact that 1.1 billion people have no form of toilet at all. This is why the UK Government have given sanitation such a high priority. The previous Secretary of State announced in April this year that the UK would increase its ambition and reach 60 million people with sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene. As I said in my speech in March, providing these services is the bread and butter of development. I have seen for myself in my visits to countries such as Yemen and Bangladesh, which the hon. Member for</p>
	<p pid="b.117.0/3">Heywood and Middleton (Jim Dobbin) has mentioned, how effective DFID sanitation programmes are on the ground.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.118.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40213" speakername="Russell Brown" colnum="118"  time="021:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0003.htm#12112635000222">
	<p pid="b.118.0/1">On the commitment given back in April, I appreciate that we are just six or seven months on, but is the Minister in any position at all to tell us what progress has been made towards that 60 million target in 2015? Is progress really being made?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-26b.118.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40515" speakername="Alan Duncan" colnum="118"  time="021:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121126/debtext/121126-0003.htm#12112635000223">
	<p pid="b.118.1/1">Since the announcement was made only recently, it is probably a little premature to report on progress because results come after the investment has been made in the area, but I undertake to keep the hon. Gentleman and the House fully informed of our progress. Through debates such as this, we will continue to treat this as a highly important topic.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/2">We know the enormous impact that the lack of a basic toilet has on people&#8217;s health and livelihoods. People who do not have adequate sanitation are far more likely to get sick than those who do, and it is often young children who suffer the most. The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 2.4 million deaths could be avoided each and every year simply by providing good sanitation, safe water and good basic hygiene.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/3">Poor sanitation does not only cause sickness. As the hon. Lady pointed out, women who lack toilets are at a much higher risk of sexual and other violence as they try to find secluded and private places. Without a decent toilet, women and girls cannot manage their menstrual periods privately and with dignity. Having nowhere to safely clean and dry their rags can lead to reproductive tract infections, which can be the most horrid things.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/4">We know from the United Kingdom&#8217;s own history the importance of sanitation to the economy and health of our people. This very Chamber was closed during the &#8220;great stink&#8221; of 1858. Not long afterwards, improvement in the treatment of London&#8217;s sewage led to a great improvement in the health of our capital city. We also know from the World Bank that providing sanitation in poor countries will deliver broader economic benefits, and will mean that such countries do not suffer unnecessary economic losses. It has been estimated that countries lacking widespread access to sanitation lose between 1% and as much as 9% of their GDP every year.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/5">The world is frequently faced with natural disasters. Last month, we saw Hurricane Sandy wreak havoc in the Caribbean before hitting the eastern seaboard of the United States. Floods, in particular, lead to disease because people have to live with dirty flood waters containing pathogens from waste that has not been disposed of. That is what leads to devastating epidemics of cholera and other diseases. Good sanitation is essential to reducing the unacceptable human cost of such disasters. It can be critical in helping communities to rebuild themselves more quickly after floods. Work supported by the Department for International Development during the 2010 floods in Pakistan showed that sanitation could really help a community to recover.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/6">How can we start to tackle the huge unmet needs for sanitation? Well, we can start by listening to women. Sanitation is important to them, often much more important than it is to men. One study in Indonesia found that, in urban communities, women listed sanitation</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/7">as their second priority for improving their communities&#8212;after improved job opportunities&#8212;while men ranked it seventh.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/8">We need to foster and respond to demand. A latrine that is wanted is one that will be used and maintained. Approaches based on demand, such as a programme called Community-Led Total Sanitation, are proving very effective in ensuring the uptake of sanitation. We also need to keep sanitation simple. Expensive and water-hungry sewerage systems are not the answer if we want to improve sanitation for poor people. Simple technologies, such as pit latrines, are affordable and effective ways of providing the safe sanitation that we want to see.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/9">As was mentioned by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40213" name="Russell Brown">the hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown)</phrase>, the United Kingdom&#8217;s ambition is for 60 million people to have sustainable access to water, sanitation and hygiene in the countries that are furthest from meeting the millennium development goal. We have a strong track record of supporting those basic services. A portfolio review of water, sanitation and hygiene projects supported by DFID showed that UK aid in the sector was well targeted at the poorest.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/10">The principal means by which the UK will meet our target of 60 million people is through programmes developed and managed by our offices in African and Asian countries. We currently have sanitation and water programmes in 15 countries. We are looking into how we can expand our existing programmes, and have already identified additional results that could be achieved in Ethiopia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Tanzania and Zimbabwe. That builds on the successful experience of our country programmes. For example, our support in Bangladesh through UNICEF has reached more than 30 million of the poorest people in that country. We are continuing our support in Bangladesh by working through BRAC, a major national non-governmental organisation with a good record of helping the poorest. The Department also funds programmes to deliver improved sanitation through other interventions. For instance, in Yemen we are funding a nutrition programme, implemented by UNICEF, which will provide sanitation in 300 schools and benefit nearly 250,000 children.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/11">We will achieve those results through a number of partnerships with organisations such as the Water and Sanitation Program, Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor, and WaterAid. To complement those activities, we have been exploring the potential of new programmes</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/12">to reach more people who currently lack access to sanitation, in more countries, through partnerships with the UN, civil society and the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/13">In response to the hon. Member for Heywood and Middleton, the UK Government are the leading donor of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, which delivers new and underused vaccines to the world&#8217;s poorest countries. UK support alone will vaccinate 80 million children and save 1.4 million lives by 2015. GAVI will roll out the rotavirus vaccine as part of its programme, protecting against diarrhoea which, as the hon. Gentleman said, is one of the leading child killers in the world, accounting for 450,000 deaths each year. With UK support, GAVI plans to help the vaccination against rotavirus of up to 50 million children in at least 40 of the world&#8217;s poorest countries by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/14">We need solid evidence to underpin our investments, and to that end the Department for International Development is funding key research programmes to improve our evidence base. The sanitation and hygiene applied research for equity programme is developing new and robust evidence on the benefits of sanitation, and on how sanitation and hygiene behaviours can be improved most effectively. The Department has started a new programme of operational research to improve value for money and efficiency in our programmes. As part of that, we will test and evaluate innovative ways of providing sanitation services to poor people in urban areas, in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/15">Support for sanitation is also about creating the right incentives for Governments to mobilise their own resources. In June this year, the UK Government sent a strong message of our political commitment with the recognition of the right to sanitation. The Government will place an emphasis on the delivery of basic sanitation services to poor people in the long term. We will continue to invest in programmes to provide sanitation, and use the Sanitation and Water for All partnership to encourage other donors, Governments in developing countries, and civil society to do the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/16">I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, all hon. Members, and in particular the hon. Member for Belfast East who initiated this debate, that the Government will do their utmost in this area. I hope that Members of the House will continue to support us in that essential work.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/17" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.118.1/18" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
