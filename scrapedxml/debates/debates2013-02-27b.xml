Moody&#8217;s decision to downgrade the UK Government bond rating is a reminder of how important it is to fix the country&#8217;s finances and a warning to those who think that we should simply borrow more.</p>

	<p pid="b.293.9/1">What is good for the economy of north Wales is good for Merseyside and what is bad for that economy hurts us too. The fact that 1,240 more people are in long-term unemployment in north Wales than a year ago does not give me hope for the economy of my constituency. What is the Secretary of State going to do about that?</p>

	<p pid="b.293.10/1">The hon. Lady is entirely right that the economies of north Wales and Merseyside are inextricably linked. The Government have created more jobs since we came to power. The rate of employment has increased by 1.6%. She should bear it in mind that the Welsh</p>
	<p pid="b.293.10/2">Assembly Government are responsible for economic development in Wales. They should therefore align their policies closely with those that this Government are pursuing.</p>

	<p pid="b.294.0/1">Will the Secretary of State admit that his economic policies are failing Wales disastrously? His new jobs are a mirage. One new worker in 10 is underemployed. They are part-timers seeking full-time work or temporary workers who want a proper job. There are underemployed breadwinners who are struggling to put food on the table and heat their homes. That is contributing to the 200,000 children who are living in poverty in Wales. Why does he not apologise for that shameful record?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.294.1/1">I will take no lessons from the right hon. Gentleman, whose party oversaw the trashing of the British economy and was responsible for the mess that we are having to clear up. The Government have created more than 1 million private sector jobs since we came to power, against the international trend, and we are proud of that.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.294.3/1">The loss of the triple A status is a stark reminder of how important it is to develop sensible policies to fix the economy. I remind the hon. Gentleman that Moody&#8217;s recognises that the UK&#8217;s creditworthiness remains extremely high and points to the strong track record of fiscal consolidation. Were it not for that, we would be on a negative outlook, rather than a stable one.</p>

	<p pid="b.294.4/1">I am glad to see that the Secretary of State is reading from a script today. No doubt, he is not trusted to make off-the-cuff comments again. I wish him a dydd gwyl Dewi hapus. What will life be like from April, after dydd gwyl Dewi, for the 170,000 working families who will lose their tax credits thanks to his Government, who prefer to give the money to millionaires?</p>

	<p pid="b.294.5/1">After April, many more families in Wales will benefit from historically high levels of employment and lower taxes. I remind the hon. Lady that since we came to power, 1.1 million people in Wales are paying less tax and 109,000 people are paying no tax at all.</p>

	<p pid="b.294.6/1">What recent assessment has my right hon. Friend made of the prospects for the Welsh house building industry?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.294.7/1">The house building industry is extremely important in Wales and a major driver of economic recovery. I was therefore disappointed to read today the comments of Steve Morgan, the chairman of Redrow plc, Wales&#8217;s largest building company, who says that the Welsh Government&#8217;s housing policies are potentially &#8220;catastrophic&#8221; for the industry, with the new regulations made in Cardiff likely to add &#163;11,000 to the cost of a three-bedroom house. At a time when Welsh builders need work and Wales needs more homes, that cannot be right. I consequently urge the Welsh Government to</p>
	<p pid="b.294.7/2">align their policies with those of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.295.0/1">Although unemployment in the Vale of Glamorgan is well below the national average, Barry still needs to attract private sector investment. Ten years ago, Barry was left out of the assisted areas map, which sadly has led to its increased decline. Will the Secretary of State work with the Welsh Government to ensure that Barry receives assisted area status this time around?</p>

	<p pid="b.295.1/1">The Wales Office is in discussion with the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Welsh Government about the assisted areas map for 2014 to 2020, but the decision on which sea areas are awarded assisted area status will be determined by the Welsh Government, subject to criteria set by the European Commission. I am sure they will listen to what my hon. Friend has to say.</p>

	<p pid="b.295.2/1">No coalition Government policy has a greater economic impact on Wales than increasing the spending power of the poorest through raising the tax-free allowance. Will my right hon.

	<p pid="b.295.3/1">As I have just mentioned, 1.1 million people in Wales are paying less tax as a consequence of policies pursued by this Government, and 109,000 are paying no tax at all. That must be good news for the people mentioned by my hon. Friend.</p>

	<p pid="b.295.4/1">The Welsh economy benefits from students from developing countries attending our excellent universities.

The decision by the ratings agency is a reminder of the debt and the deficit problem that this country faces and, frankly, it is a warning to anyone who thinks we can walk away from it. It is absolutely vital that we continue with the work of this Government, who have cut the deficit by a quarter, with a million extra private sector jobs and interest rates at record low levels.

His argument is that the rating agency does not matter and that the answer to debt is to borrow more and not to take any responsibility for the mess they left. It is this Government who have cut the deficit by a quarter, who have a million extra private sector jobs and who have low interest rates that are vital for the future of the economy. Economies that maintain their triple A rating are those of countries such as Canada and Germany that fixed the roof when the sun was shining.

I do not know when he last checked, but the deficit is rising, not falling, this year&#8212;and, because of his failure to grow the economy, he is borrowing &#163;212 billion more than he planned. Now, let us turn to the reasons for the downgrade. May we take it from his answers so far that he really believes that this loss of the country&#8217;s triple A status, which he set as the test, has nothing to do with him?</p>

	<p pid="b.304.1/1">I am the one saying that this credit rating does matter. It demonstrates that we have to go further and faster on reducing the deficit. The very fact that the right hon. Gentleman will not answer the question about wanting to borrow more, which the country needs to know, means that he will never sit on this side of the House. If he wants to look at what is happening in our economy, is it not interesting that he does not mention the other economic news from last week, which was 154,000 extra people in work and more people in employment than at any time in our history. Youth unemployment is down since the election; unemployment is down since the election&#8212;that is what is happening in our economy, but the right hon. Gentleman cannot recognise it. When is he going to admit that we should never listen to someone who sold the gold, bust the banks, racked up the deficit and cannot say sorry for any of it?</p>

	<p pid="b.304.2/1">I think we can take it from that answer that the Prime Minister cannot accept the simple fact that he has failed on the first test he set himself, and it is his fault&#8212;it happened on his watch. Borrowing is rising, even after all the pain of the tax rises and all the spending cuts because the part-time Chancellor&#8217;s plan is failing. The truth is that they are the last people left who think that their plan is working and that the failure has nothing to do with them. We have 1 million&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>The Education Secretary calls out, &#8220;That&#8217;s not true&#8221;, so perhaps he believes it, too, but behind the scenes he is briefing against the Chancellor.

	<p pid="b.316.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to require the Government to publish a list of the powers of local councils and a code of conduct defining the degree of autonomy attached to those powers and areas where a council may act autonomously; to create a mechanism to identify and adjudicate on breaches of the code by either central or local government; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/3">Given where we are in the parliamentary timetable, one would have to be wholly ignorant or severely optimistic to assume that the Bill I propose stands any chance whatever of becoming law&#8212;this year. Although as a Lib Dem I am equipped by necessity with boundless reserves of cheery optimism, I have no expectation of seeing the Bill mature into legislation. So confident am I of seeing it strangled at birth that I did think of calling it the &#8220;Local Government and Futile Measures Bill&#8221;, only to realise that the additional phrase probably applied to much of the legislation in this place. I am far from disheartened, however, because such events, apart from seeming a piece of typically British, eccentric constitutional indulgence, or useful occupational therapy for Back Benchers, can have an effect, by putting, or keeping, on the agenda important key themes. My last foray in this role was an attempt to introduce a Bill to enhance, or provide, democratic accountability for NHS services. The Government have now actually done that, although I would like to think that my proposals, which involved the creation of no new institutions or structures, offered a more elegant, less expensive and less complex solution than that contrived by the Government in the Health and Social Care Act 2012.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/4">Our system is based on the supremacy of Parliament, and my Bill draws attention to the fraught relationship between local and central Government. Parliament, Brussels notwithstanding, has unfettered power, or what Lord Hailsham referred to as elective dictatorship. Local government also has powers, but they can be increased, decreased, removed or added to, fettered or unfettered, by us in Parliament. Governments often promise&#8212;I have heard them do so&#8212;to liberate or empower local government, but the liberation of local government by central Government often resembles Stalin&#8217;s post-war liberation of eastern Europe, as it simply allows discretion to decide on how to implement unpopular policies, thereby sharing or deflecting the blame.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/5">Largely, and insistently, central Government retain all their rights to interfere in any area, at will, with little or no notice. I am not making a party political point; it is not in the DNA of central Government, irrespective of who is in power, to give away power that matters, and one can understand why. Local government deals with huge areas of national importance&#8212;education, social care, transport, the environment, the economic vitality of communities&#8212;and Ministers simply cannot be uninterested in what local government does or how it does it, so they keep in reserve, understandably, a range of powers, regulations and incentives to influence how local government performs. Parliament will not have its will crossed&#8212;it is, as they say, an elective dictatorship. The Bill aspires not to change any of that,</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/6">but strives more modestly to stop elective dictatorship becoming or turning into elective tyranny.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/7">There are in this Chamber bold constitutional visionaries, such as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40461" name="Graham Allen">the hon. Member for Nottingham North (Mr Allen)</phrase>, who propose a full constitutional settlement reserving to local government a whole set of autonomous powers, safeguarded by commissions, the Lords and a Bill of Rights; a constitutional demarcation between the powers of local and central Government, including revenue-raising powers. The Justice Committee&#8212;my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40073" name="Alan Beith">the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith)</phrase> is familiar with this&#8212;having surveyed all the evidence available scrupulously, has called for a new constitutional settlement, a new code. There is a glimmer in the eye of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40526" name="Clive Betts">the hon. Member for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts)</phrase>, who chairs the Communities and Local Government Committee, to produce a report on precisely that subject.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/8">My aim is the more modest one of preventing elective dictatorship from becoming elective tyranny, because tyranny is the arbitrary, whimsical and indulgent use of power. The distinction is rather helpfully illustrated by the exemplary behaviour&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40222" name="Grahame Morris">The hon. Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris)</phrase> has got there ahead of me. It is illustrated by the exemplary behaviour of our current Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government. Only someone as gifted as him in the art of irony could possibly have introduced a Localism Bill&#8212;with over 100 new powers ascribed to himself. Only someone with a feel for the truly comic could wring &#163;250 million out of the Chancellor in hard-pressed times in order that statesmen can interfere with the nation&#8217;s bins and council collection times, or could instructively chastise and threaten councils that have set their council tax exactly within the limits he himself laid down. As he himself has said, he takes liberties, but presumably only to demonstrate through a process of reductio ad absurdum how little power local government really has and how it can be removed, changed or denatured by the whim of Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/9">Taking liberties is not necessary a good thing. My Bill seeks to mitigate that, first by requiring every Government to lay down in advance through a defined code their understanding of the respective powers of local and national Government, the areas of genuine autonomy, and specify devolved powers. That could be done, fully taking into account national needs, with or without consensus. However, that having been done, and there having been defined separate spheres of action&#8212;the rules of the game&#8212;everyone must stick to them, with an appeal to a judicial or quasi-judicial body when that understanding is breached by either party, or ridden over roughshod to suit the mood of whoever holds the reigns of central or local government.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/10">The Bill simply aspires to put in place a guarantee of reasonably predictable behaviour, a self-denying ordinance. The Government could still dictate and legislate for a different relationship, but they would not be able to interfere arbitrarily. In fact, having to make it clear that they are not doing that is wholly to the good. They</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/11">could not act on the spur of the moment. They would simply be denying themselves the opportunity to create havoc, either financial or administrative. There is fairness in that, because the previous Government insisted that local councils, when making major strategic decisions, give the population ample advance notice and engagement through publication and consultation&#8212;a kind of &#8220;no big surprises&#8221; rule. All that I expect through the Bill is that Whitehall would show similarly helpful self-discipline, particularly because councils, unlike Whitehall, have to balance their budgets annually and cannot cope too easily with handbrake turns in policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.316.2/12">It seems to me that having to make clear Whitehall&#8217;s interest in interfering, as it does, with council&#8217;s planning policies, housing targets and borrowing arrangements, which are all contentious areas, and having to make a case and then abide by it, could hopefully throw up a plethora of anomalies and unjustifiable restraints and perhaps expose the dead-weight influence of state bureaucracy accrued over a fair period, which cannot be a bad thing. It might, in the process, rid me of an abiding and disturbing image of the Secretary of State as a languid eastern potentate or sultan governing by mood or arbitrary decree, and it would hopefully put the fraught relationship between local and central Government on a business-like footing. This issue, which has been raised in various parts of the House and in a number of different places, will not go away, unlike my Bill, which I commend to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.319.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.319.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House deplores and opposes the Government&#8217;s introduction of the housing benefit under-occupancy penalty; believes it to be unjust and unworkable; notes growing public anger at its introduction; believes that the Government is showing a reckless lack of care and attention to the consequences of its introduction for low-income households affected by disability; further believes that it will adversely affect, amongst others, families of service personnel, foster families and those struggling with the effects of family breakdown; notes that some parts of the UK will be disproportionately hit because of the mismatch between the available social housing stock and the needs of tenants; further notes that according to the Department for Work and Pensions&#8217; Equality Impact Assessment, 63 per cent of the 660,000 claimants affected by the under-occupancy penalty or their partners are disabled; believes that the measure unfairly penalises tenants in rural and inner-city areas; further believes the under-occupancy penalty will fail to meet its stated objectives; and calls on the Government to abandon this policy immediately.</p>
	<p pid="b.319.1/3">In just a few weeks&#8217; time the Government&#8217;s notorious under-occupancy penalty, or bedroom tax, is set to come into effect. Across the UK, it is going to cut for tenants by an average of &#163;14 a week, or over &#163;700 a year, the housing benefit of an estimated 660,000 low-income households who are deemed to be living in a home bigger than their needs require. The measure is causing anxiety and anger in equal measure. It follows hard on the heels of punitive cuts to tax credits that have already slashed the budgets of low-income families, and it compounds the real-terms cut to the safety net of social protection for people who are unable to work because of sickness or disability, and for those rendered unemployed or under-employed by economic circumstances well beyond their control. This bedroom tax is a further assault on the precarious finances of the people who are already bearing the brunt of the Government&#8217;s austerity measures, which, as we have seen this week, simply are not working. The under-occupancy penalty is inherently unfair and inherently unworkable.</p>
	<p pid="b.319.1/4">When we discussed this issue in Westminster Hall a few weeks ago in a debate led by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40521" name="Phil Wilson">the hon. Member for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson)</phrase>, not a single Government Back Bencher rose to defend the policy, and it is deeply disappointing that they are so thin on the ground today. I can only assume that too many MPs have been lured by the charms of Eastleigh, but I am not really surprised that they are reluctant to put their heads over this parapet.</p>

	<p pid="b.319.2/1">Does the hon. Lady see any justification for treating tenants on housing benefit in social housing any differently from tenants on housing benefit in the private rented sector?

	<p pid="b.320.0/1">The hon. Gentleman has exposed at this early stage one of the big red herrings in this debate, namely the argument that the private rented sector is comparable to the social rented sector. We already spend significantly more on supporting people in the private rector than on those in socially rented accommodation, which is significantly cheaper. I hope to return to that point later, but it is very helpful to have been able to nip that argument in the bud at the outset of this debate.</p>

In response, the Work and Pensions Secretary said that he would look again at the impact of the policy on disabled people, but having considered the wholly disproportionate impact on disabled people and their families, he is ploughing on regardless. It is callous and reckless and will cause untold distress and hardship. The Government really need to think again.</p>

	<p pid="b.322.5/2">To return to the point made by the respected charities, one of which I used to work for, they make a compelling case that exposes just how socially destructive and counter-productive the bedroom tax will be for disabled people and their families. The Government&#8217;s stated objectives for the under-occupancy penalty include incentivising tenants to move to smaller homes. Moving house is stressful and expensive for everyone, even when it is a welcome move. How much more stressful and difficult must it be for disabled people with very little money?</p>
	<p pid="b.322.5/3">Pressuring people to relocate will not just move disabled people away from their informal support networks&#8212;the friends and neighbours who help them live in the community&#8212;but it will potentially move them away from support services provided by their local authority. Moving to a new house in a new area may require a new assessment of needs, delays in providing replacement services or, indeed, changes to the eligibility for services. That all creates unnecessary disruption and expense that could quite easily be avoided.</p>

	<p pid="b.323.2/1">It is utterly daft. I have seen cases in my own constituency where relatively minor changes to local authority support services have destabilised the balancing act performed by families who provide care while juggling work and family commitments. I have met far too many family carers who are already at the end of their endurance, compromising their own health and well-being to continue to care. When carers cannot cope any more or their own health breaks down, the human cost is immense and the financial cost of primary health care spending and the need for expensive care packages are incalculable. The bedroom tax undermines the ability of families to continue to care.</p>

We estimate that at least 16,000 homes in Scotland that are affected by the bedroom tax have been adapted. We are told by the Government repeatedly that an extra &#163;50 million in discretionary housing payment has been allocated to local authorities to plug the shortfall in rent so that those in adapted homes do not have to move.</p>
	<p pid="b.323.6/3">Let us do the sums. The additional discretionary housing payment amounts to only 6% of the total shortfall across the UK. In Scotland, it amounts to a paltry 4% of the shortfall. That means that even if Scotland&#8217;s entire discretionary housing allocation&#8212;not just the extra bit, but the entire allocation&#8212;was focused solely on those disabled people living in adapted homes, it would not cover the gap in tenants&#8217; incomes left by</p>

	<p pid="b.324.5/1">It is clear that rents in Scotland are not out of control as they are in London. Many of the problems with housing benefit have been fuelled by the vast over-inflation of the rental market in London and the south-east.</p>

Nevertheless, all those people will still have to deal with the same impairment or long-term health condition that they had before, and will still face the same physical, economic, attitudinal and communication barriers when they attempt to access the labour market and get on with their daily lives.</p>

	<p pid="b.325.0/1">The reason that the housing benefit bill is so high is that we have had a recession that has pushed people out of employment. One of the trite suggestions that we have heard repeatedly from the Government in trying to defend this indefensible tax is that people should just pick up a few extra hours&#8217; work here or there to meet the bedroom tax. Since the start of the financial crisis, underemployment has soared. Millions of people have seen the prospect of overtime vanish and their working hours cut. According to the TUC, there are 3.3 million people across the UK who are working part time, but who want to be working full time. That is twice the pre-recession level. When we look at the steep rise in housing benefit, we therefore have to look at the inflation in the housing market in some parts of the country and at the underlying economic drivers of unemployment and poor economic performance.</p>

Foster carers are not routinely included in housing needs assessments, and the allowance that they are paid to cover the costs of meeting a child&#8217;s needs does not include a component for housing costs. The Government expect local authorities to support foster carers out of the heavily over-subscribed discretionary housing payments pot. However, as we have already seen, that money will not even cover the most pressing needs of disabled people in specially adapted homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.326.1/3">Foster carers do an important and difficult job. Children requiring foster care have, almost by definition, been through traumatic experiences and are likely to require more intensive care and attention than other children. For that reason, many fostering services insist that foster carers do not take on other work outside the home. Moreover, more than half of foster carers do not receive a fee for fostering. The Fostering Network is afraid that the bedroom tax will exacerbate existing difficulties in recruiting foster parents. Given the already extreme shortage of foster carers, the Government need to look again at how the system will work in practice.</p>

	<p pid="b.327.5/1">Again, I will come to that and consider some of the structural issues in a moment. First, however, I want to mention pensioners who so far have been excluded from the under-occupancy rules. That is important because many older people who are technically under-occupying are extremely anxious about the bedroom tax and frightened that it will force them to move. We must make it clear that they will not have to do so at this stage. Once universal credit is introduced, however, people of pension age who have a younger partner of working age will be subject to the bedroom tax, and again, they will be forced to move into smaller, more expensive, and often less suitable homes. That is a false economy for the Government and will have a great human cost for older couples.</p>

	<p pid="b.327.7/2">Amid all the soundbites about spare bedrooms, there has been a failure to acknowledge the underlying shortage in affordable housing across the UK and the backdrop of changing population demographics. What makes the Government&#8217;s under-occupancy rules fundamentally unworkable is the mismatch between available social housing stock and the needs of tenants and prospective tenants. The scale of the problem varies across the UK, but in Scotland, for example, only 26% of homes available for social rent are one-bedroom properties yet 60% of tenants affected by this measure require a one-bedroom home. According to the National Housing Federation,</p>
	<p pid="b.327.7/3">in England there are twice as many people under-occupying two-bedroom homes than the number of one-bedroom properties that became available last year. No matter how we shuffle people around, not enough homes of the right size are available for affordable rent. That mismatch is entirely outside the control of tenants yet they are being punished for a structural problem not of their making.</p>

	<p pid="b.328.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is having a go at the record of the previous Government but he cannot abdicate all responsibility from previous Tory Governments who made it impossible for local authorities to build houses without them being sold off at below market value to tenants who bought them at knock-down prices. That underpins the whole shortage of supply and Government Members cannot pass off responsibility for having created the problem in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.328.1/2">Housing in the social rented sector is by far the cheapest option for people on low incomes. In my constituency, a three-bedroom council house can be rented more cheaply than most one-bedroom flats. People who live in council houses already have limited choice about where they live and what sort or size of house they are offered. Councils and housing associations already go to great lengths to match tenants with a house of the right size, but they do not have enough one-bedroom properties to go round. Many councils allocate homes on a points-based system, which is the most transparent and fair approach, but they require considerable flexibility from prospective tenants in terms of the size, location and type of property they will accept. Demand exceeds supply. Anyone who knocks back the offer of a house because it has two bedrooms when ideally they need one bedroom may not get another offer. People cannot be picky and must take what is available.</p>

	<p pid="b.328.3/1">Colleagues from Wales are saying that there the Labour Government have passed on 100% of the cuts. Surely it is better that the Scottish Government have tried to mitigate the impact of those cuts on households, rather than passing them on wholesale. We must remember that most of our social housing was built in an era when people had much larger families and different housing needs. Existing housing simply does not match today&#8217;s demographics.</p>

	<p pid="b.329.0/1">I will not at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="b.329.0/2">The great irony of the bedroom tax is that it will not save any money. As I pointed out early in the debate, it already costs more on average to house people on low incomes in the private sector than to house them in the social rented sector. Last year, the average housing benefit payment in the social rented sector was &#163;80.71 a week, but in the private sector it was &#163;107.35. Rent paid to social landlords tends to be reinvested in social housing, which in my view represents better value for money for us all. All the bedroom tax will do is cause upheaval, distress and expense to people on low incomes, most of whom, as we have heard, are battling health problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.329.2/1">I will not give way.</p>
	<p pid="b.329.2/2">Although the mismatch between the housing stock and tenants&#8217; needs is the glaring flaw in this ill-thought-through and unworkable policy, the under-occupancy penalty will have serious unintended consequences for social landlords who depend on reliable and steady flows of rent to maintain their credit rating, keep rents low, and reinvest in new and existing properties. I have repeatedly raised with Ministers the impact of welfare reform on social landlords, but to date Ministers have repeatedly failed to take seriously the concerns of housing associations and others about the impact that the bedroom tax and the shift to universal credit will have on social landlords&#8217; finances. Last week, in response to a question from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40273" name="Ann McKechin">the hon. Member for Glasgow North (Ann McKechin)</phrase>, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland said that he had met social housing providers in Scotland and satisfied the concerns of housing associations and local authorities. However, since then, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations have written to him to make it abundantly clear that they are not satisfied, and that their concerns have in no way been assuaged. The president of COSLA has made it absolutely clear to the Government that all local authorities in Scotland continue to have deep concerns about the 14% and 25% penalties associated with under-occupying. Those key stakeholders recognise that the bedroom tax penalises people on low incomes who cannot move to smaller properties. They are concerned that no safeguards are in place to protect the finances should tenants fall into arrears.</p>

	<p pid="b.331.1/1">I will not give way.</p>
	<p pid="b.331.1/2">We should also look carefully at the loopholes in the bedroom tax regulations. Apparently, the meaning of &#8220;bedroom&#8221; is not clearly defined in the legislation. I heard yesterday that one large housing association in England&#8212;the Knowsley Housing Trust&#8212;has reclassified 600 properties to protect tenants. That obviously comes at a cost to the housing association, but it is nevertheless a brave and socially responsible move. I am sure that social landlords are also seriously considering bricking up windows or taking down walls.</p>

Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg)</phrase> referred to this&#8212;have called for two-bedroom properties to be exempted from the rules. They argue that it makes no sense for them to build inflexible one-bedroom homes, because they want to encourage long-term tenants who are integrated in the community, not transient short-term tenancies.</p>
	<p pid="b.331.1/4">Another potential mitigation measure that might help in urban areas is for housing associations to co-ordinate most effectively their waiting and transfer lists, as we have seen on Merseyside. Obviously, that will not work so well in more rural and dispersed areas, but it might help in cities. There is a range options, and it is important that we look closely at all of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.331.1/5">To return to a question posed earlier, social landlords need to be consistent in how they deal with arrears. I am not sure we can draw a distinction between someone who falls into arrears because of the bedroom tax and someone who is not under-occupying but falls into arrears because their employment and support allowance has been cut, because their tax credits have been reduced, because they lose their job or because they have fallen sick. The danger is that if some people have their arrears written off and others do not, that will quickly cause resentment between tenants, all of whom are likely to be living on tight budgets and in danger of experiencing significant increases in rent across the board if housing associations budgets come under strain.</p>

	<p pid="b.331.2/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. The proposal in the petition to amend section 16 could help current tenants to avoid eviction, which is a good thing, but it will not extinguish debt, which can be chased by other means, such as arrestment of wages or money from bank accounts. We know that from the experience of the poll tax. How many years after the poll tax died were people being pursued for arrears?</p>

	<p pid="b.331.3/1">My hon. Friend&#8217;s legal expertise helps him to make a compelling point. Social landlords are aware that more people will be at risk of arrears and that they are being proactive in trying to prevent that from happening, but they are clear that their ability to provide affordable homes depends on their ability to</p>
	<p pid="b.331.3/2">collect rents from tenants. The real problem is that the under-occupancy penalty is unfair and unworkable. Instead of trying to mitigate its worst effects, we should concentrate on changing the underlying problems and abandoning the bedroom tax. In Scotland, we clearly have an opportunity to do that by bringing decision-making powers back to the Scottish Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="b.331.3/3">Housing Associations have historically been seen by lenders as relatively stable, and have been able to borrow money at competitive rates. Mary Taylor, chief executive of the SFHA, has pointed out to Ministers that</p>
	<p pid="b.331.3/4">&#8220;already it is proving harder for landlords to borrow from banks, whether to build or to fund major repair and retrofit programmes. And where they can borrow it is invariably at a higher cost than before, even though interest rates generally remain low and stable. According to Housing Associations, lenders are pointing to the lack of security of rental income arising from Welfare Reform as a key factor in these rising costs. Lenders have to assess risk&#8212;and they recognise the very real risks, even if the Government is stubbornly refusing to do so. I believe the Council of Mortgage Lenders raised these issues with the Government over a year ago, but we are still to see action.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.332.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point&#8212;some housing associations already contend with that problem. If they are to continue to invest in their existing properties and continue to build the new smaller properties that we need to meet our changing demographics, they need to be able to borrow, and to do so cheaply. Any increase to the costs of borrowing will have only an inflationary pressure on rents and service charges. That pressure falls back on the low-income households in the social rented sector, who can ill afford it. There is no doubt in my mind that the problems for social landlords, caused by the shortfalls in housing benefit for people affected by the under-occupancy penalty, will be further compounded by the end of direct payments under universal credit.</p>

	<p pid="b.332.3/1">I will not give way to the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.332.3/2">The bedroom tax is a nasty, vindictive and unnecessary measure. The under-occupancy penalty is manifestly unfair. It puts disabled people on low incomes right at the front of the austerity agenda, and asks people on the lowest incomes to pay the price for the structural problems affecting the supply of affordable housing. However, the bedroom tax is also unworkable: instead of addressing the underlying problems, it undermines the ability of social landlords to invest in the kind of affordable housing that is so badly needed, and it fails to tackle the excessive private sector rents in London and surrounding areas that have fuelled inflation in the housing benefit bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.332.3/3">The Secretary of State needs to get a grip. The bedroom tax will not save any money, but it will cause chaos for tenants and social landlords alike. It will</p>
	<p pid="b.332.3/4">cause untold distress for those forced to leave their homes and communities, or for those who find themselves grappling with spiralling debt. It is not too late for the Government to think again. I urge Ministers to reconsider: scrap this crazy measure, or at the very least look again at exempting households affected by disability; look again at the budget for discretionary housing payments; offer local authorities support commensurate with the identified needs of disabled people and foster carers; and look again at whether it is reasonable to consider two-bedroom homes as under-occupied at all. I would have more respect for the Government if the Secretary of State postponed this measure and listened.</p>

This measure saves &#163;500,000 a year, so if we were trying to fill Labour&#8217;s deficit by measures of this sort, we would need 300 such measures to tackle that scale of borrowing.

	<p pid="b.336.7/1">My right hon. Friend has some credibility on the issue of welfare reform, because he has been prepared to vote for difficult decisions on public spending. Neither the Labour party nor the nationalist parties have taken any difficult decisions on anything&#8212;they simply oppose everything&#8212;whereas he has, quite fairly, been willing to take some difficult decisions and support them and, again quite properly, raise concerns about the detail of policy. He is entirely right. The principle of the policy must be seen in the context of deficit reduction. Given that we have to reduce the deficit, we want to do so in a way that potentially has upsides as well as</p>
	<p pid="b.336.7/2">downsides, such as by making better use of the social housing stock, but it has always been our intention to protect the most vulnerable. The additional &#163;30 million on top of the core &#163;20 million for discretionary housing payments is the key way we want to do that, and I will say more later about how we want to ensure that that system works.</p>

	<p pid="b.337.5/1">Let us address the position of armed forces personnel specifically, because there has been an awful lot of misinformation about that. A married member of the armed forces is unaffected, so if someone is living with a spouse and goes away to fight&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>Let me work my way through&#8212;they will be unaffected. A young serviceman or woman living in barracks will not be affected either, because they are not social housing tenants. Many young service personnel living with parents not in social accommodation will not be affected, and neither will young people living in social accommodation who are not on housing benefit, so we are narrowing down the number of people we are talking about probably to a very small number. When a young serviceman or woman, leaves social accommodation where the parents are on housing benefit, their housing benefit will go up.</p>

There will be a charge for under-occupancy, which might be, say, &#163;14 a week. Instead of paying &#163;70 to the household housing costs, the young serviceman or woman will not have to pay anything, so if they value the room at &#163;2 a day, they could still pay that &#163;2 to mum and dad and be more than &#163;50 a week better off. Rather than seeing mum and dad&#8217;s housing benefit fall, therefore, they will see it increase. So we have dealt with that issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.338.1/2">The hon.

We spend more housing benefit on social housing tenants than on private sector tenants and we pay for their rent subsidy, so it is wrong to say that we subsidise private tenants more than we do social housing tenants. That is simply wrong. But if someone is living in private rented accommodation, broadly speaking we do not allow them an extra bedroom. Why, then, is it fair to have two houses next door to each other, one of which is privately rented and the other socially rented, and give a spare bedroom to the person in social accommodation, who also benefits from subsidised rent, but not to the person in the private rented accommodation?</p>

	<p pid="b.338.2/1">The Minister is being characteristically generous in giving way. Why does he not tell the House the whole story and admit that the DWP has lost its case in the Court of Appeal and that its policy of discriminating against disabled people and not giving them any kind of special treatment has been struck down by the courts? That is why his Department has applied to the Supreme Court to have it looked at again.

	<p pid="b.338.3/1">The case to which the right hon. Gentleman refers is in the courts now&#8212;before this policy has been implemented&#8212;so it is not specifically about this policy, but about a broader issue concerning the private rented sector. So it is a challenge to the regulations that his party was responsible for.</p>
	<p pid="b.338.3/2">I will say more in a moment about the specific way in which we are planning to address the position of disabled people, because that is an important issue. Roughly two thirds of all social tenants have a disability as defined by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, based on the measure used in our impact assessment. That is a similar proportion to those affected by this measure, so it is not disproportionate. If we look at the stock of social tenants, we inevitably find that about two thirds of them are in that category, and that is true of this specific measure.</p>

	<p pid="b.340.2/2">The cost of housing benefit increased in real terms by 50% in the past decade to &#163;23 billion. Given that we said we would ring-fence the state pension, the biggest thing that we spend money on, we simply cannot ignore housing benefit for people of working age if we want to save money.</p>

	<p pid="b.340.4/1">No, I want to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.340.4/2">For social sector tenants alone, the bill totalled &#163;14 billion. That is why we have had to look at this area of spending. The system for tenants renting in the private sector has already been tightened in a number of respects, and there is a fundamental fairness issue involved here. Is it right to squeeze private sector tenants&#8217; housing benefit while making no change in the social sector, where rents are already subsidised and where people already have an advantage? That is what we are trying to address.</p>
	<p pid="b.340.4/3">At the moment, there is a spare bedroom subsidy. We subsidise a million spare bedrooms in the social rented sector through housing benefit. We have a situation in which two households next to each other can be treated inequitably. We heard the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan talk about fairness. We have to be fair to the different sorts of tenancies. Those living in the social sector already benefit from a subsidised rent. Should they also benefit from a subsidised spare room? When we have a million spare bedrooms, and over a quarter of a million households living in overcrowded accommodation, we must do better. We have to regard the spare bedrooms in the social housing stock as a precious resource that we can make better use of.</p>

	<p pid="b.340.5/1">What would the Minister say to people who wish to downsize from a larger home to a smaller one, but who find that such accommodation simply does not exist in their areas? In mainly rural areas such as mine, such accommodation does not exist. People could be offered another home many miles away from where they have grown up, from where they work or from where their friends are. This is a ridiculous policy.</p>

	<p pid="b.341.1/1">Let me just address the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point before he replies to my reply. I have not finished replying to his first point yet.</p>
	<p pid="b.341.1/2">There has to be better use of the social housing stock. I pay tribute to the housing associations in the Liverpool area, 20 of which have come together with local authorities to pool their housing stock. I take the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point that a small housing association might have limited stock and limited scope for moving people around, but by pooling their stock, those organisations are able to make better use of it so that more options will be available. I entirely accept his point that the answer to this question will be different in a city from in a remote rural area, and that is why we are more than happy to look at whether the allocation of discretionary housing payments to help people in rural areas is the right answer. As it happens, the allocation of DHPs is slightly over-represented in rural areas, compared with city areas, because of the way in which it has been done. We recognise that there is an issue there.</p>

	<p pid="b.341.2/1">I thank the Minister for that answer, but he said that there would be a range of responses to the policy, including paying the difference. However, people on housing benefit are, by their very nature, on low wages. They are already under intense pressure from rising energy and fuel prices and from freezes on benefits if they are receiving any. It will be difficult for those people to make up the difference in that way. Their choices will be very limited, and many will be forced to move by financial necessity when the change comes in.</p>

	<p pid="b.341.3/1">We have already seen the impact of our restrictions in the private rented sector, and we know that people make certain choices. It would be wrong of any of us to belittle those choices, given the financial situation, and I do not do so, but we have seen people on relatively modest incomes in the private rented sector saying that paying &#163;2 a day for a spare room is worth more to them than spending that money on something else. Some people in that sector are making that choice, and that is part of where the saving comes from. Some people in the social housing sector will do the same thing.</p>

	<p pid="b.341.4/1">In my constituency, the choice is between staying put in two-bedroom properties, of which there is a surplus, or moving to one-bedroom properties in the private rented sector, which cost more in housing benefit. How does that represent a saving?</p>

	<p pid="b.341.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that point. It is a common misconception that there is a one-way flow of people in this context. If someone moves from social housing into the private rented sector, as some do, that frees up socially rented accommodation, into which someone who might previously have been living in overcrowded, temporary or bed and breakfast accommodation can move. There will be flows in both</p>

	<p pid="b.342.0/1">Does the Minister not recognise that the largest single driver for the increase in housing benefit in England is rent increases, not only in the private rented sector but in the social and affordable sector, because of the policies of his colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local Government who are pushing rents up higher? If a tenant moves out of a secure council tenancy into a new affordable rent tenancy, that will involve a substantially higher rent. If that person is on housing benefit, the benefit bill will rise. That is entirely counterproductive. Why is the Minister doing this?</p>

	<p pid="b.342.5/2">We recognise that this is a time of change that will present challenges for tenants and for landlords, and we have to support both. One of the positive things to come out of the change is that landlords are getting to know their local authority tenants and social housing tenants far better than in the past. All too often, housing associations did not know their tenants well enough; we have now seen an important process of getting to know individual tenants and their needs. As a result, some of the more creative housing associations have schemes whereby half a dozen people have moved accommodation so that there is a better fit between the individuals and their housing needs. The 1 million spare bedrooms are a precious resource of our communities and of vulnerable people in them, and I will not have it said that those who stand up for the vulnerable are on the Opposition Benches, as we are standing up for them and we want those bedrooms filled.</p>

	<p pid="b.343.7/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady. The point of the policy is not for people to be evicted, which would raise costs for the Exchequer and for the individual, but to ensure that existing housing stock is fully occupied.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.7/2">Let me try directly to address the issue of the shortfall. There were two ways in which we could have approached the matter, one of which was blanket exemptions, which is what we did for pensioners. I am grateful to the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan for making it absolutely clear in opening the debate that pensioners are not covered by this change.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.7/3">It is clear that we wanted to protect another set of people. Let me deal with the example of foster children, whom my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> mentioned. The position on foster families is, I think, shared across the House. If people need a spare bedroom for a foster child, we want to make sure that they have one, and we want to support fosterers. The question is whether that is done better by some blanket exemption or by what we have done in costing what it would take to meet the shortfall for those families and giving the money to local authorities so that a foster family for which this was an issue&#8212;it might not be an issue for all of them&#8212;can approach the authority and have the shortfall made up.</p>
	<p pid="b.343.7/4">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I are entirely open to discussing whether that is the most</p>
	<p pid="b.343.7/5">effective way of delivering that support. Our judgment was that discretionary housing payments gave local authorities the discretion we would want them to have. If for any reason that message is not getting through and is causing anxieties to foster families who do not know about DHPs, for example, or if local authorities have not communicated well enough, we would be happy to look at whether this is the most effective way of supporting families. Where there is a shortfall, discretionary housing payments for this and other measures are available. We want to make sure that people use them when they are in genuine need.

	<p pid="b.344.0/1">That was really helpful. I want to pursue the issue raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40037" name="Anne Begg">the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg)</phrase>. The Minister has said that he is willing to look at whether the discretionary funds will meet certain problems. May I take it that he and the Secretary of State would be willing to look at the categories defining which people need a bedroom, as I think some categories that are not currently counted as falling within the definition should be included in it?</p>

	<p pid="b.344.1/1">I can see the attraction of that approach, and I think there is a balance to be struck. The attraction of the approach for foster families would be that the size criteria could be defined and then categories of people such as a couple, teenage children and so forth could be added to the list. We could say that a bedroom used for a foster child is a bedroom, so no deduction applies, people do not need to go to the council for the DHPs and the Department for Work and Pensions rather than the local authority would meet the bill. That is one way of doing things.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.1/2">The challenge for us in that approach is defining in Whitehall all the categories of people who ought to have a room. There could be difficulties even within a category, as there might be foster carers, for example, for whom this is more or less of an issue. It could vary from case to case. We have to make the judgment: where do we need to make a blanket exemption or a blanket entitlement to a room, and where do we say that we will give the local authorities money and discretion? Each side of the argument has its attractions. We have to ensure that the money we have given to local authorities is well spent and that people know it is coming.</p>
	<p pid="b.344.1/3">I have been interviewed on various television programmes, which have featured case studies of people who were obviously distressed&#8212;and I do not doubt that some people are distressed by this change. Obviously, however, if they approached their local authority, they would not be affected by it. That is the issue. They would go to their local authority, which has been given money to help them; the authority would help them, so they would not be affected. My right hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40037" name="Anne Begg">the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne Begg)</phrase> are right that we must ensure that people are not unduly alarmed, as in many cases money is available to help the most vulnerable.</p>

	<p pid="b.345.0/1">My hon. Friend raises an important point. We have allocated funds to local authorities with two particular groups in mind: foster families and those for whom there has been a substantial adaptation to the property. We can all see whether a house has been substantially adapted; moving someone somewhere else and adapting the property again will not be a good use of public funds. That is the basis on which the funding was allocated. We have indicated that to local authorities, but I agree with my hon. Friend that we can probably do more and will do more to make sure that local authorities are aware of the needs of those groups.</p>

	<p pid="b.346.1/1">I am going to make some more progress, but I shall be happy to respond further later.</p>
	<p pid="b.346.1/2">We have engaged actively with a range of advice organisations, including the Chartered Institute of Housing, to develop guidance for social landlords. We have already encountered many examples of social landlords working with tenants to prepare for this change. However, we recognise that certain individuals will face problems, which is why&#8212;on top of the &#163;20 million in DHPs that local authorities already receive&#8212;we have allocated an extra &#163;30 million. As I have said, a total of &#163;50 million will be available to them to help people who are affected by this policy. I have already mentioned two groups whom they can help: disabled people living in significantly adapted accommodation, and foster carers, including those who need to retain an extra room when they are between fostering placements. I believe that authorities will be able to help about 5,000 foster carers, and about 35,000 wheelchair users living in adapted housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.346.1/3">There has been some discussion about the position of disabled people. The definition of disability used in our impact assessment is a self-assessment based on a household survey. It should be borne in mind that fewer than a third of the people affected by the policy are receiving disability living allowance. We have also touched on the position of service personnel, and I think that I have reassured the House about that.</p>

	<p pid="b.346.5/2">allowance and the support component of employment and support allowance as a sign of our commitment to disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="b.346.5/3">The hon. Lady suggests that we should exempt a third of those affected by the policy. As she will understand, this measure is partly about reducing the deficit and partly about making better use of the housing stock. Receiving DLA is not synonymous with needing a spare bedroom: that is the point. Someone who needs a spare bedroom can approach the local authority, and we have given local authorities funds for that purpose, but a blanket exemption of people receiving DLA does not correlate with the need for a spare bedroom.</p>

That case is very much in flux at present, and I do not want to say too much about it. However, let me make a general point that sums up what we are trying to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.3/2">We are trying to tackle a massive structural deficit. The biggest two items of public spending are public sector pay and benefits. We have taken action on public sector pay, with little or no support from the Opposition. We have also had to take action on benefits. We have concentrated on working-age benefits because we have protected the state pension, and no Opposition Member has suggested that we should not have done that. We were trying to find &#163;12 billion from public spending, and housing benefit is one of the biggest working-age benefits. We had tackled private sector housing benefit, and we had to look at the social sector. The most valuable way in which we can look at social sector housing benefit costs is to look at the million spare bedrooms that we currently subsidise, and to ask whether that subsidy is fair to the people who do not receive it.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.3/3">These are difficult choices, but we have had to make them because of the mess that the Labour party left to us. I hope that the right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill will begin with an apology.</p>

	<p pid="b.348.4/1">I think that most Opposition Members will have been pretty disappointed by what the Minister has said. A range of important arguments have been advanced this afternoon, but they have received no answers whatsoever.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.4/2">Let me begin by congratulating the Green party, Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party on tabling the motion. We support it, and we will support it in the Division Lobby later today. Since the Welfare Reform</p>
	<p pid="b.348.4/3">Act 2012 first saw the light of day, we have warned of the flaws that have loomed large this afternoon. It was my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40226" name="Stephen Timms">the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms)</phrase> who first warned that the people who will be hit by the Act have nowhere to hide and that they will just have to pay up, and it was my noble Friend Lord McKenzie who said in the other place that the discretionary housing fund would nowhere near cover the costs and consequences of this policy. I am afraid that everything we have heard this afternoon merely confirms what they have said. That is why through Divisions in the Chamber and in Committee here and in the other place we have tried to put in place safeguards which would have stopped the horror show that will begin in April.</p>
	<p pid="b.348.4/4">As the weeks have gone by, my colleagues have clearly set out the faults and flaws in glorious 3D Technicolor. First, we learned that someone who is handed a 12-month sentence will be exempt from this policy. I have here a list of offences which attracted a sentence of less than 12 months in 2011. It includes some 43 people who were convicted of threat or conspiracy to murder, who will be exempt. There are also 273 people convicted of sexual offences; they, too, will be exempt. Yet mothers of members of the armed forces who are currently out there serving, like Alison Huggan&#8212;the case raised by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" name="Tom Blenkinsop">the Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Tom Blenkinsop)</phrase>&#8212;will be hit, and the Minister defended this policy this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="b.349.7/1">I just want to establish one thing: the right hon. Gentleman is now changing his party&#8217;s legal policy. It has been a very good principle in this country down through the ages that people are innocent</p>
	<p pid="b.349.7/2">until proven guilty, not guilty before they are proven innocent. The reality is that we stick within the existing strictures. The right hon.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.350.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40083" speakername="Liam Byrne" colnum="350"  time="014:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0002.htm#130227-0002.htm_spnew111">
	<p pid="b.350.0/1">The Secretary of State cannot defend the fact that families of serving soldiers will be hit by this policy while those on remand and accused of the most serious offences we can imagine will not be hit by it. I do not think that the Secretary of State, of all people, will want to defend that. He should be speaking to his colleagues the Secretary of State for Defence and the Prime Minister, who I understand is the Chair of the Sub-Committee on the Armed Forces Covenant, and he should be bringing to this House safeguards for the families of armed personnel out on service, should he not? As he remains in his place, it is clear that he is not going to bring forward those safeguards for the families of people serving on the front line. The House will be disappointed to have observed that.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.0/2">Foster parents will also be hurt. Again, we heard nothing from the Minister today about how foster parent families are going to be helped. <i>[Interruption.] </i>I listened very carefully to what the Minister said, and he said nothing today that countermands what he sent out in a recent circular, which says:</p>
	<p pid="b.350.0/3">&#8220;a household that has an extra room for a current or potential foster child will be treated as under-occupying.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.350.0/4">Families in that position will be hit, therefore. <i>[Interruption.] </i>We then hear that under universal credit a couple where someone is a pensioner and someone is not will also be hit. <i>[Interruption.]</i></p>
	<p pid="b.350.0/5">Over all this, of course, looms the truth that two-thirds of the people hit by this bedroom tax will be disabled. <i>[Interruption.] </i>The Minister has been pleading from a sedentary position that the discretionary housing payment will somehow help. He will, no doubt, have seen the National Housing Federation research that found that 200,000 people who will be hit by this bedroom tax are on disability living allowance. The NHF estimates that if we spent all the DHP money helping those people, it would help 73,000 people, so there would be 127,000 people in receipt of DLA who would get absolutely no help whatever. Of course, that would leave nothing for foster parents either. I am afraid that the Minister cannot simply plead that the DHP is of some help to foster parents, those who are disabled and people whose houses have been adapted. The truth is very different, and he has been found out this afternoon.</p>

	<p pid="b.350.1/1">Much has been said about particular groups who will be hit by this policy and my right hon. Friend is right to talk about the impact on disabled people and foster families. There are also, however, people like my constituent Hayley Duncan, who has two boys aged one and 13 who are now expected to share the same bedroom. I can honestly say I would not ask two children of mine of such different ages to share the same bedroom. Does my right hon. Friend think this is right? Is there hypocrisy here?</p>

	<p pid="b.350.2/1">Of course there is. The Minister, unlike his party colleague <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>, did not resile</p>
	<p pid="b.350.2/2">from his support for a whopping great tax cut for millionaires at the same time as Hayley Duncan and her children are being hit by this bedroom tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.2/3">This is a policy that is unique in its cruelty. It sets out to tackle the problem of under-occupancy, and the Minister made much of the 1 million spare bedrooms he wants somehow to bring on to the housing market. As he knows, however, the policy will only save the money chalked up in the Treasury scorecard if it fails. That is the reality. About &#163;490 million is earmarked to be saved by this policy over the course of this year, but it will be saved only if 660,000 households are hit for &#163;14 a week for 52 weeks a year. That is how those savings will be delivered. This is not about bringing spare bedrooms on to the market; it is about hurting vulnerable people and asking them to pay extra.</p>
	<p pid="b.350.2/4">What is particularly troubling to many Opposition Members is the Minister&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge that in many parts of the country there will simply not be the smaller houses for people to move into. Again the NHF has been very clear about that. In large parts of the country there is simply not the housing stock for people hit by this tax to move into. The Government have removed any shelter where vulnerable people can take cover before opening fire. This is a policy of unique cruelty, therefore. The Government are not seeking to solve under-occupancy. Instead, they are simply seeking to make the poorest and most vulnerable even poorer. As the Secretary of State once cared about poverty, perhaps he would like to justify that fact?</p>

	<p pid="b.351.0/1">Will the right hon. Gentleman explain the following two important points? Under the Labour Government&#8217;s local housing allowance changes, the situation for children of the same sex in respect of the size criteria was exactly the same as we are now introducing in the social sector. Why is it good for one but not for the other? Secondly, he is crowing about the number of social houses in existence, but why did the last Labour Government leave the building programme at the lowest level since the 1920s?</p>

	<p pid="b.351.3/1">I am answering the question. The Deputy Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.351.3/2">&#8220;If I&#8217;m going to be sort of self-critical, there was this reduction in capital spending when we came into the coalition government&#8230;But I think we&#8217;ve all realised that you actually need, in order to foster a recovery, to try and mobilise as much public and private capital into infrastructure as possible.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.351.3/3">But what has happened in the past couple of years? What has happened even in the past year? For the last year for which records are available, the number of housing starts in this country has fallen by 11%. That is the reality of what this Government have delivered.</p>
	<p pid="b.351.3/4">This policy is not simply a cruel punishment; it is a cruel and unusual punishment, because it is not normal&#8212;it is not usual in a modern, advanced and civilised country&#8212;to reward the rich in quite the way this Government are proposing while punishing the poor. It beggars belief that next month&#8212;the month in which those on &#163;1 million a year will get a &#163;2,000-a-week tax cut&#8212;those with a</p>
	<p pid="b.351.3/5">spare bedroom will face a &#163;14-a-week rent rise. In what world is that fair or normal and usual? It is only in a Tory world, defended by a Liberal Democrat.</p>

	<p pid="b.352.0/1">As some very misleading comments about housing have been made by those on the Government Front Bench, will my right hon. Friend confirm that in 2007, the last year before the recession, the net additions to the housing stock in this country numbered 207,000? The current Government have presided over a collapse, and fewer than 100,000 new homes were started last year. That is their shocking record and they should not pretend otherwise.</p>

	<p pid="b.352.1/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right about that. Of course, the Labour party is proposing to have a tax on bankers&#8217; bonuses in order to release &#163;1.3 billion for new housing and to spend the 4G licence proceeds on building homes. That is in sharp contrast to the sob story from the Deputy Prime Minister lamenting the fact that the Government cut capital spending too far and too fast.</p>

	<p pid="b.352.2/1">Does my right hon. Friend accept that the savings that the Government anticipate and project are gross savings, not net savings? That is because many local authorities will end up with voids without rents and will make losses, so they will not be able to do their repairs, at a time when private sector rents will be pressed up by excess demand, giving returns on buy-to-lets to the private rented sector and increasing housing benefit costs.

	<p pid="b.352.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Secretary of State may truly believe that this policy will save his Department &#163;490 million a year, but his Minister of State was rather less than forthcoming earlier on swearing that that would be the figure. The Secretary of State may genuinely believe that this policy will save &#163;2 billion over the forecast period. If he does genuinely believe that it will save the money set out by the Treasury in Budgets gone by, he is deluding himself, because the evidence is staring him in the face: this policy will cost more than it saves.</p>

At a time when the country&#8217;s debt rating has been downgraded, that will make things incredibly difficult for housing associations in delivering on future social housing builds. The bedroom tax will only make the situation worse.</p>

Gentleman has slightly moved on from the point he was making about the so-called millionaires give-away, but it is a certainty that Opposition Members will come back to it repeatedly. Will he explain, as he is particularly well placed to do so having been in the Treasury, why it was in only the last 37 days of the Labour Government that any measures were taken to increase taxes on the richest people in this country? If he is going to refer to this issue continually, he should, being a former Treasury Minister, be prepared to explain why that was the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.353.4/1">I am happy to do so. It will not have escaped the hon. Lady&#8217;s notice that today&#8217;s fiscal circumstances are somewhat different from those of the 13 years of the previous Labour Government. She supports<i>&#8212;[Interruption.]</i> I will answer her question just as soon as the Government Front Benchers simmer down slightly. The truth is that her Government have delivered a double-dip recession and perhaps worse; they have just presided over a downgrade in the nation&#8217;s debt rating; and growth has been flatlining for the past couple of years, which has made the deficit position far worse. This Government are going to borrow more in this Parliament than Labour did in 13 years, so the question now has to be: how is the pain of paying down the deficit to be shared? Labour has always said that there has to be a mixture of growth and sensible public spending cuts&#8212;that is how to get the deficit down. What we should not be doing is having a &#163;3 billion tax give-away for Britain&#8217;s richest citizens while asking 660,000 people to pay an extra &#163;14 a week. How would she justify that to her constituents?</p>

	<p pid="b.353.5/1">That is just not good enough from the right hon. Gentleman. The financial crash happened in 2008 and, by independent agreement, there was already a structural deficit at that time. In order not to bequeath an ever-growing structural deficit and rising debt to</p>
	<p pid="b.353.5/2">another incoming Labour Government or, as it turned out, this coalition Government, no action was taken in the immediate aftermath of the financial crash. Surely he cannot justify that fact.</p>

	<p pid="b.354.0/1">If we are to go back over the history, I should say that, as the hon. Lady will know, at that time the Conservative party supported Labour&#8217;s spending limits&#8212;that was the announcement made by the then shadow Chancellor at the party conference. The question that confronts the country now is: how do we bring the deficit down? Once upon a time, we were told that we were &#8220;all in it together&#8221; but we now know that the truth is quite the opposite. Once upon a time, the Chancellor said that he was not going to balance the books on the backs of the poor, but now we know the truth&#8212;he absolutely is balancing the books on the backs of the poor, starting with &#163;14 a week extra from 660,000 people.</p>
	<p pid="b.354.0/2">The evidence that this policy is going to cost more than it saves is now staring the Secretary of State in the face, just as I can see it clearly, too. He will have read the reports from all over the country<i>&#8212;[Interruption.]</i> Perhaps he will confirm this from a sedentary position. Like me, he will have read the reports from all over the country that have gone to cabinet meetings setting out the impact of his changes to communities up and down the country. The reports could not be clearer and they confirm the substance of the letter leaked by the private secretary to the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government that up to 20,000 people will be made homeless as a result of these changes, and that does not include the impact of the benefit cut.</p>
	<p pid="b.354.0/3">This policy affects councils like Hull city council, which says that 4,700 tenants will be hit, yet in Hull there are just 73 one-bedroom and two-bedroom properties available to let. There is a shortfall of 4,700 properties for tenants. If they move into the private rented sector or to become homeless, that will cost the taxpayer a fortune. This policy will cost more than it saves, as has been powerfully argued today, and I am not surprised that the Minister of State is no longer prepared to swear by the savings that this policy is supposed to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="b.354.0/4">Here we have a Department that is at the height of its powers. It has brought us a Work programme that is worse than doing nothing, it has presided over a universal credit system that I understand is on the brink of collapsing into chaos, and now we have a policy that will cost more than it saves. Why? Because the Secretary of State has been rolled over by a downgraded Chancellor and has not had the strength to resist him.</p>
	<p pid="b.354.0/5">We now have the worst of all worlds. We have a Department bedevilled by an excess of stupidity and an absence of spine. The cost is paid not by the Members on the Government Front Bench but by the 1 million children who will be plunged into poverty by the Secretary of State&#8217;s Department and the 3.4 million disabled people who will be hit by his strivers tax. He should instead be bringing to this House proposals that would genuinely bring down the welfare bill by getting more people into work. We now have nearly 1 million young people out of work and nearly 1 million people out of work long term, and that is costing us a fortune. He knows full well that the housing benefit bill is set to rise by &#163;8 billion over the course of this Parliament because of his failure to get people back into jobs.</p>
	<p pid="b.354.0/6">That is why the Secretary of State should be arguing. He should find some spine and tell the Chancellor that it is about time we had a tax on bankers&#8217; bonuses to build new homes and get people into work. If we said to people in this country that they could not spend more than two years on the dole and that at that stage they had to work, that would be a proper plan for welfare reform and for welfare to work. It would be a real alternative to this policy, which is a cruel and unusual punishment from a cruel and useless Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.355.0/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this important issue. As a former chairman of housing in Bradford and chair of the regional housing board for Yorkshire and Humber, I know the importance of social housing and housing benefit in meeting housing needs. My own extended family have used it and use it now.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/2">In my district alone, tens of thousands of people are on waiting lists trying to gain access to social housing. The previous Government failed to build sufficient social housing and the former Prime Minister raided the regional housing boards&#8217; funding allocation of tens and millions of pounds that could have been spent on addressing this housing shortage. I must say, however, that he gave some of it back, repackaged as new money, in the months leading up to the last general election. The reality is that the previous Labour Government robbed millions of pounds from the regional housing fund allocations that could have been spent on social housing and that was allocated for that purpose, and which could have addressed some of the issues we face today.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/3">Merely sustaining the housing benefit bill of &#163;23 billion costs each individual family &#163;900. That is unsustainable. The Government are attempting to put fairness back into social housing, bringing the sector in line with the private rental sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/4">I would like to facilitate the building of more social housing. It is really important, particularly in the current housing market, to get people on to the property ladder, if they have the opportunity, and to get them in stable housing. I encourage the Minister for Housing to make efforts to spend his limited money&#8212;some &#163;300 million has been allocated for developing social housing&#8212;in areas such as Bradford&#8217;s canal corridor and on the excellent community scheme in Spring Bank in Keighley. The Government are delivering social housing where the previous Government failed.</p>
	<p pid="b.355.0/5">Much has been said in the past hour or so about adapted accommodation for the disabled. I want to put on record what the Government have said they will do, as opposed to the somewhat misleading arguments that have been made by the Opposition. If someone lives in accommodation that has been significantly adapted for a disabled person, they will be entitled to a discretionary housing payment to address some of the shortfall. Some &#163;30 million of the Government&#8217;s discretionary payment has been specifically aimed at foster carers and disabled people who have made changes to their homes, and when the disability means that the household needs an extra room, local authorities have been allocated a further &#163;150 million to make discretionary payments.</p>

	<p pid="b.357.3/1">I welcome today&#8217;s debate on a serious and deeply worrying issue. I, like many others, spent last week in my constituency, where almost every conversation I had&#8212;with constituents, DWP local managers, banks, post offices, housing associations, credit unions and my local citizens advice bureau&#8212;was centred on the so-called bedroom tax. Today, I listened carefully to the Minister of State, who took great pleasure in referring to the &#8220;spare room subsidy&#8221; and the question of equity. It reminded me of the debates on the poll tax in the early 1990s, when it was considered &#8220;equitable&#8221; that the poor should take a heavier burden. That message resonates today right across the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.3/2">What struck me about those conversations last week was how unprepared we are for perhaps the most dramatic setback in decades for our housing sector and local communities, first, among the tenants. Up to the end of last year, housing providers earnestly hoped they could persuade the Government to change their mind; then they started to write to their tenants, who in turn put the letter in a safe place and hoped the issue would go</p>
	<p pid="b.357.3/3">away too. Only since the start of this year have tenants&#8217; eyes been opened to the true horror, as housing associations have now started physically to knock on their door and find out how they intend to cope.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.3/4">Let me give the examples of two constituents I met last week. One of the women looks after her father full time&#8212;she gave up her work 15 years ago to act as a carer&#8212;and he lives nearby in a one-bedroom flat, so she cannot move in with him. Because there are no spare houses, she faces having to move to the opposite side of Glasgow and then trying to commute every day to look after her father. The other woman is 58 years old and single; she has lived where she is now for 17 years. She is a good tenant, who keeps the area stable and looks after her neighbours, but she faces being moved many miles away to an area she does not know and where she does not know the local people&#8212;even though she does not have the money to move house in the first place. One question the Government have not asked is how we will manage moving all those people, many of whom have no spare cash.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.3/5">Most welfare advisers and DWP staff I spoke to last week believe that now, we are seeing only the trickle, and that the flood of inquiries will start when the bills begin to arrive through people&#8217;s letterboxes. We know the grim facts about the lack of suitable stock&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase> described in some detail the extent of the problems right across the country, both in urban and rural areas&#8212;but analysis of the impact on individuals and the stability of their families, the detrimental impact on local communities as good long-term residents leave, the destabilising impact on schools and children&#8217;s education as many desperately look for properties to move to, and the likely non-payment reaction that will follow, is simply shallow and unco-ordinated.</p>
	<p pid="b.357.3/6">The impact on our housing associations should not be underestimated. Earlier this month, as the hon. Lady mentioned, I raised with the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland, who is not here to hear the debate&#8212;nor is the Secretary of State for Scotland&#8212;the impact on housing associations&#8217; credit rating. That is not just a technical point: many experts are talking quietly about the need for wholesale consolidation of local social landlords, so that they can avoid bankruptcy as they try to cope with the ruinous increases in their cost of borrowing at the same time as they face a huge hike in both arrears and administration costs, with many having only very small reserves to buffer the losses. That impact will be worsened by the introduction of universal credit later this year. Even the Chief Secretary to the Treasury is now beginning to voice concerns about the impact of direct rental payments to tenants.</p>

That is being actively done. As a former housing chair, I can see that is a practical solution.</p>

	<p pid="b.358.1/1">My hon. Friend describes the problem. I represent a seat in Glasgow where all the social rented properties are in the hands of housing associations. Many of them are very small and unfortunately do not</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/2">have the capacity or resources that even a local council has, and some of the smaller local authorities will be very hard pressed to cope.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/3">In reply to my question, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland assured me that he had met local authorities and housing associations in Scotland and discussed their concerns about credit ratings, and that they were &#8220;satisfied&#8221;. Funnily enough, the following week the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, which represents all the local authorities in Scotland, and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations wrote to the Minister to set out a slightly different view. The SFHA wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/4">&#8220;With respect, this does not address the issue of the credit rating of associations. Indeed I am not aware of any government impact assessment of credit rating of associations but if it does, I would welcome access to it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/5">Does the Minister have an impact assessment he can share with us? The SFHA continued:</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/6">&#8220;We remain very concerned about under-occupation issues, not least given the escalation in rhetoric about non-payment of the &#8216;bedroom tax&#8217;, so called purposely to resonate with the Poll Tax, a debacle which left councils with a trail of debts only now being resolved even in your own constituency.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/7">If that seems harsh, the letter from the president of COSLA reflected utter astonishment at the Minister&#8217;s response to my question. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/8">&#8220;While I do meet the Secretary of State for Scotland from time to time, I can&#8217;t recall the last time we had an opportunity to discuss my concerns over welfare reform with any DWP Government Ministers&#8230;.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/9">There was a hastily arranged meeting on 22nd November&#8230;which we understand the Scottish DWP office invited a selected number of council leaders to attend. Few were able to do so, and COSLA was not represented although an officer was present to observe and take notes&#8230;.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/10">Those notes, and feedback&#8230;confirm that David Freud informed the meeting of the steps DWP are taking in response to a variety of concerns that were raised. These were felt to be inadequate, considerable dissatisfaction remained, and David Freud gave an undertaking to return to Scotland to discuss the matters further&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/11">but, funnily enough,</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/12">&#8220;This meeting has still not been confirmed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/13">Perhaps the Minister who winds up the debate can confirm when his noble colleague Lord Freud intends to meet local authorities in Scotland to discuss with them what they can do to meet the impact of this change, which is to happen in just a matter of weeks.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/14">The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan suggested some changes that could happen in Scotland. Unfortunately, I think her colleagues in the Scottish Government have pressed the standard pause button, saying, &#8220;We need to wait until the sun starts to shine and we have independence&#8221;, but of course that depends on a referendum and we are still waiting for the date of that. The plain fact, to which the hon. Lady alluded, is that we do not have time on our side and people cannot wait. We need to start a serious debate now on how we can resolve these issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/15">The coalition talks about the ever rising cost of housing benefit over the last 10 years. Yes, it is a problem that we are subsidising landlords when rentals are increasing at well above rates of inflation, yet the Government have made not one suggestion or proposal to address that or the systematic failures in the housing market as a whole. I believe there has been a permanent</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/16">change&#8212;a major distortion&#8212;in the housing market since the banking crisis in 2007. We will not simply see a bounce-back to the position in 2005-06 at some undetermined point in the calendar, so I have some suggestions on how to deal with housing as a whole, not just the issue of people on housing benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/17">Other Members have commented correctly on the need to build more housing, both in the social rented and private sectors. How much land in Scotland, or the UK, is held by building companies as part of their land banks? It is estimated that perhaps 250,000 houses with planning permission are still to be built. Has there been an audit of where those properties are? Can we levy unused plots of land to provide a stimulus to build, because in many cases builders are just waiting to get more money for the land on which they sit? Can we control private rentals? The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan rightly commented that rental levels in the private sector in Scotland, as in many other parts of the United Kingdom, are in excess of those in the social rented sector. According to Shelter Scotland, the taxpayer would on average pay more than &#163;100 extra in local housing allowance each month if someone in Edinburgh moved from the social rented sector to the private sector, and the same would apply in Glasgow and Inverness; in Aberdeen&#8212;one part of the United Kingdom enjoying something of an economic boom&#8212;an extra &#163;200 would be paid per month. The hon. Lady was incorrect, however, to state that increases in rentals were a phenomenon only in Greater London. There is a shortage of housing, and people cannot afford to buy a house or provide a deposit, so they are moving into the private rented sector, pushing rentals ever upwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.358.1/18">In a speech last month, the Leader of the Opposition referred to reform of the law on residential leases, which should also be considered in Scotland, where the law is distinct but not that much different. The law was last altered in the early 1980s, to create short-term assured tenancies, which have become the absolute norm&#8212;the default&#8212;for all private residential domestic tenancies. Although there is clearly a market for short-term assured tenancies, they are not suitable for an increasing number of people who are looking for security and stability and to put down roots in a local community.</p>

	<p pid="b.360.1/1">My hon. Friend refers to regulated rents. I am afraid that I am not an expert on the law of leases in England, but in Scotland long-term secured rentals are still subject to regulated rents. Very few of those remain in the United Kingdom&#8212;the average age of the residents in such cases is probably 85 plus&#8212;because frankly they were not attractive to the market at the time when the law was changed. In urban communities&#8212;the situation is worst in London, but it is an issue in areas such as Glasgow as well&#8212;transience is increasing, as people move house at ever more regular intervals, not through choice or for job reasons but because their landlord thinks he can find another tenant who is prepared to pay a higher rental. The only way to stabilise the market and get rentals back down is to improve regulation, and that is why the law needs to change. The</p>
	<p pid="b.360.1/2">Scottish Government should start an urgent debate about that. There is no reason why Scotland cannot lead the way in the reform of leases.</p>

	<p pid="b.361.1/1">The hon. Gentleman raises a good point. The Leader of the Opposition has stated on the record that we want to reform the law of leases in England to create longer-term leases of five years plus. That would be a good measure to stabilise the market.</p>
	<p pid="b.361.1/2">Registered social landlords should also be provided with much better assistance. Scotland has many small housing associations. The Scottish Government, working with local authorities and housing associations, should be much more proactive in seeing how they will cope with the additional costs they will undoubtedly incur. The housing association is often not just a landlord but acts as the hub of the local community, providing community resources and arranging contact with local police or local schools. It is very much in the control of local tenants and represents the local community. Should a consolidation of housing associations be necessary, it is vital that that be planned rather than chaotic, and that they be fully supported throughout the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.361.1/3">In Scotland there is also a need to examine how local authority powers under social work legislation can be used. As Members have commented, the costs of eviction and of housing people under the homelessness legislation are high, and in many cases it is much easier, and cheaper for the public purse, for a person to remain in their house.</p>
	<p pid="b.361.1/4">We also need to consider increasing council tax bands, to find out whether we can levy the additional &#163;50 million per annum&#8212;that is a rough estimate&#8212;that the change will cost social landlords and councils. That would provide a buffer zone. I believe that those with the broadest shoulders, not the poorest, should take most of the burden.</p>
	<p pid="b.361.1/5">Doing nothing is not an option. Dropping the bedroom tax and working with tenants, housing associations, local authorities and the devolved Administrations to reduce housing benefit costs in a sensible and co-ordinated way that does not kill our communities should be the only option on the table. I urge the Government to reconsider.</p>

	<p pid="b.361.2/1">The policy under discussion has clearly led to much debate and concern, some of which has been based on misunderstanding and misinformation, and some of which has been based on people&#8217;s fears about the changes that they will have to face in April.</p>
	<p pid="b.361.2/2">No one in the House could argue with the idea behind this policy, which is to deal with the fact that there are people in social housing who have more rooms than they need. The Government have said that 1 million spare bedrooms are having to be subsidised by other taxpayers, but the nub of the issue is the disagreement about whether all those bedrooms are really spare rooms.</p>

	<p pid="b.362.8/1">As the hon. Gentleman has clearly heard, it is the former. I hope that is clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.8/2">The simple reality is that the social housing sector has an exemption in this regard that the private rented sector does not have. It is important to remember that in April 2008, when I sat on the Opposition side of the House, the previous Labour Government introduced the local housing allowance. I was a member of the Work and Pensions Committee at the time and know that it was not an entirely controversial measure, as Opposition Members will remember. We scrutinised it and raised concerns, but the then Labour Government were absolutely clear that local housing allowance would and should depend not only on the maximum rent allowed for properties in the area, but specifically on the number of rooms a tenant needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.362.8/3">Again, the principle behind bringing this measure into the social housing sector is reasonable, and it would be helpful if the Opposition at least acknowledged that and said that they wish to assist and encourage people who are over-occupying and have more bedrooms than their family need to seek alternative accommodation in order to free up those properties. We all know from our huge case loads that that is needed. We can blame the previous Government and the Government before</p>
	<p pid="b.362.8/4">them for simply not building enough and for the absurdity of allowing the right to buy a council house without then building more to replace them. Those are things that this Government have committed finally to addressing.</p>

	<p pid="b.363.1/1">I am not quite sure what relevance that adds to the point I was making. Again, the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Front Benchers were committed to benefit cuts in their 2010 manifesto, which they seem conveniently to have forgotten.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.1/2">As I have said, I do not believe that the Government currently have the policy right. I have told the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase>, and other Ministers and colleagues that I believe that other exemptions should be included. Let us remind ourselves who the current exemptions are for: those of pensionable age; those in local housing shared ownership; those in temporary housing; the recently bereaved, who have protection for 52 weeks; and those who are provided with overnight care by an unpaid carer. I firmly believe that there should be other exemptions, as I said when the Bill was going through the House. We were unsuccessful in achieving any of our proposed amendments, which is why I did not support the Bill at the time. I made it clear that I could not support the policy as it stood then, and I cannot support it as it stands now.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.1/3">Let me explain the other exemptions that I believe should be included. First, if it is deemed that two partners have to sleep in separate rooms for medical reasons or because of a disability, clearly they should be exempt. Similarly, if a child with a disability is deemed to require a separate room, they, too, should be exempt. Social housing plays a different role in the housing mix and is there, in particular, to support families in that situation who also have a low income. Of course, that would help with the current issue over the Court of Appeal ruling. The easiest thing for the Government to do would be to accept those exemptions.</p>

	<p pid="b.363.2/1">I am listening to the hon. Gentleman carefully. Obviously, I would prefer that this change was not happening at all. While he is on the subject of possible exemptions, does he agree that foster parents should also be exempt? When I raised that with the Minister at Work and Pensions questions, he talked about a discretionary fund, but foster parents in my constituency have told me that, because of the uncertain future, they might be put off continuing to foster. Would it not be much better if foster parents whose spare rooms are not a luxury but used to care for children who would otherwise probably be cared for at greater cost to the public purse were also exempt?</p>

	<p pid="b.363.3/2">cared for. Much of the criticism of the Government has been unfair and party political, which is in the nature of democratic politics, but the principle behind this measure, as I have said, is reasonable. We need to try to address the issue because of the housing crisis we face and to enable families living in seriously overcrowded accommodation to find appropriate housing. However, it is important that the Government do not undermine other key objectives, and clearly one of those is placing more children with foster families and encouraging more people to foster. I am afraid that that is what the measure, without the exemption, threatens to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.3/3">The other category that I believe should be exempted is families who have sadly split up because the parents have separated, which is always difficult for every member of the family. In the majority of cases, the father is the non-resident parent and the parent without care. Whether they have their child for three days a week or two days a month, for example, is in many cases not determined by them; it is often imposed and has to be accepted even though the non-resident parent would like their child to stay with them more often. The parent wants to ensure that when their child stays they feel that it is also their home.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.3/4">We talk about broken homes, but in reality we are talking about a family with two homes, or in many cases we are talking about two families. It is therefore perfectly reasonable for the non-resident parent to maintain a bedroom and keep it for their child, with their things in it, so that when they come to stay they know they are staying with their other parent, at their other home and in their other bedroom. I think that is very important. Of course, child benefit is paid to the parent with care, so there can be serious financial pressures on the non-resident parent, who still has to feed the child, possibly for up to three nights a week, and indeed they also want to be able to contribute by buying things for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.363.3/5">My message to my hon. Friend the Minister is please to look at these things again. He is absolutely right that there must be room for discretion, and some of that should rightly be exercised locally.</p>

	<p pid="b.364.0/1">Does the hon.

	<p pid="b.364.1/1">In certain cases people have the choice of taking in a lodger in order to enable someone else from their family to live there. However, my point is that there should be clear exemptions based on a clear medical need for a separate room, and if people have those exemptions, that discussion is no longer necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.364.1/2">If the exemptions that should be in place are there, the question of where local discretion should be used becomes discretionary rather than a set of difficult choices. Discretion should be used, for example, in the case of properties that have been adapted on the basis of a certain need.</p>

	<p pid="b.365.1/1">I have made it clear that the exemption needs to be a straightforward one for people who need a separate bedroom because of their disability. Again, if that is in place, we do not need to have this discussion, and then we have to look at whether the adaption should qualify.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/2">Similarly, there is local discretion if a bedroom is clearly needed for storage of medical equipment for a child with a particularly severe disability, for example. Discretion can also be applied for people with certain mental health conditions&#8212;something that can be far better assessed locally than it possibly could be through legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.1/3">The people who know best about local issues and problems with housing stock are those in the local authorities and housing associations. In some areas, local authorities and housing associations have been keen to place people in accommodation that has been very hard to let. They will often put, say, single people or couples into a two or three-bedroom property in what has been deemed a difficult-to-let area, and so they end up under-occupying. It becomes ironic if someone then has to move away from that area, leaving the property lying empty. The discretion should be intended precisely to deal with that kind of knowledge of each different local housing issue.</p>

	<p pid="b.365.3/1">We need to have the further exemptions that I have mentioned so that we are clear that discretion is just that, rather than for dealing with large categories of people whom many of us believe should be exempted in the first place. We can divide up the amount put forward by the Government, which is a significant sum, but it needs to be targeted at the types of matters that I have specified, and it has to be discretionary. That is why it is essential that we have the further exemptions or give councils the choice.</p>

	<p pid="b.365.6/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman; he has been very generous. Does he accept that many people are worried because they will not be able to apply for the exemption until the scheme kicks in, so by the time they are assessed they will have potentially built up rent arrears?</p>

	<p pid="b.365.7/1">That is not my understanding. I am encouraging people to contact their councils now, and that is the message that each and every one of us should send out. There is clearly an information problem that</p>
	<p pid="b.365.7/2">needs to be dealt with, because people should be applying for these exemptions now. I am encouraging them to do so, and some in my area already have.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.7/3">To ensure that this policy succeeds in its twin objectives of bringing down the cost of the welfare budget and freeing up homes, it is important to allow the discretion so that people should be subject to paying the additional sum only if they have turned down reasonable smaller accommodation&#8212;because in many areas there are not enough one-bedroom properties around. Members from rural constituencies have expressed concern about people potentially being moved great distances to a house, taking them away from their communities. Again, there needs to be local discretion, and it applies even in urban areas. For example, someone in the north of Leeds, in Yeadon or in Otley in my constituency, might be asked to move right to the other side of the city. There are factors that need reasonably to be considered as part of local discretion: for example, if the person is in work and receiving housing benefit and does not have a car, it can be very difficult for them to get to work, or they may need family support for caring, for child care responsibilities or in relation to schooling.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.7/4">I hope that I have made it clear that I fully support the Government&#8217;s desire to tackle the spiralling cost of welfare benefits and the reasonable and sensible measures that they have proposed that are designed to do that. I fully support their policy thrust of making sure that our welfare system is properly focused on those who most need it. The same should apply to our social housing sector. There are difficult decisions for all parties in making sure that social housing is being used by the most vulnerable and the poorest in our society, because at the moment it is not being used in that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.365.7/5">On this occasion, I have to say to my hon. Friend the Minister that I will abstain on the motion because, as this policy stands, I still feel that it does not pass all the tests that the Government have rightly set themselves. I urge my hon. Friend, the Secretary of State and colleagues to look at it again. They should look very seriously at what further exemptions could be introduced to deal with the remaining issues. They should also make sure that they bring forward a full and proper programme of review so that as the policy goes forward it can be reviewed to see whether it is doing what it set out to do and is not leading to unfair and unforeseen consequences, in which case they would have to make changes further down the line. I urge them to look at the measure again now, before it is introduced, to see what can be done to show people that it is about improving the system so that it is aimed at bringing down the cost of the welfare budget and positively trying to deal with the problem of overcrowding in which many families find themselves.</p>

	<p pid="b.366.0/1">I want to begin by talking about the impact of the bedroom tax on Wales and my local area. I say &#8220;bedroom tax&#8221;, but I note that the Minister has renamed it during the course of this debate as the &#8220;spare room subsidy&#8221;. That sounds a lot better, and I am sure that that will be of great comfort to those facing it in April.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase> described in her excellent contribution how this provision is just part of an accumulative effect that is</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/3">hurting the vulnerable. I want to mention the case of a couple I met during the recess when I was knocking on doors in my constituency. They have been hit not only by the bedroom tax, but by other things as well. They had worked all their lives. The husband used to be a driver, but he was hit by rheumatoid arthritis and had his driving licence revoked. He has, therefore, been unable to work, not least because, as he showed me as I sat in his kitchen, he cannot hold a mug for any length of time. He was moved off incapacity benefit on to employment and support allowance, and was then incorrectly put in the work-related activity group on reduced benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/4">The husband&#8217;s benefit and that of his wife were reduced as he waited for his appeal, which took eight months to come through. He won it, then two days later he received another letter from Atos telling him to go back for a work capability assessment. In the meantime, because the couple&#8217;s income had dropped, they were forced to claim housing benefit and received a letter telling them that they would be liable to pay the bedroom tax in April. Luckily, the husband had won his appeal after an eight-month wait, so he thought that that might help but, on top of everything, his wife, who had worked in a manual job, was diagnosed with myelopathy. She had hoped to retire this year, but will now have to work another three years because of the Government&#8217;s changes to women&#8217;s pensions. To cap it all, this couple&#8217;s experiences with the work capability assessment mean that they are now absolutely terrified of the personal independence payment, particularly the mobility component, which may lead to them losing their mobility vehicle.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/5">I hope that the Minister does not in any way underestimate the palpable fear and anxiety among the disabled community. This couple worked all their lives until illness hit them later in life and they now find themselves hit on all fronts when they need a safety net. The Government&#8217;s replies are doing nothing to allay their fears.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/6">Advice services, which are themselves being hit hard and cut, are also experiencing anxiety, as are housing associations and local authorities, which in my experience locally are working extremely hard to try to mitigate the profound effects of the bedroom tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/7">Nationally, as we have heard, 31% of housing benefit claimants of working age in the social rented sector will be affected. As the shadow Welsh Secretary, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40482" name="Owen Smith">the Member for Pontypridd (Owen Smith)</phrase>, has said, in Wales that figure is 46%, with the Department for Work and Pensions estimating that 40,000 tenants will be affected. Newport city council in my area has calculated that 2,455 households will be affected. Newport City Homes housing association says that 1,794 of its tenants will be affected and Monmouthshire Housing Association, which covers parts of my constituency, notes that it has 421 such tenants. What choices do those people face? They can move to a smaller social housing property, pay up or move into private rented accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/8">Turning to smaller social housing&#8212;to give an idea of the real impact in my area&#8212;there are 4,220 people on the common housing register in Newport and 2,500 in Monmouthshire. There is not enough social housing available. For example, of those affected in Newport,</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/9">916 will be looking for one-bedroom houses or flats, and 823 for two-bedroom properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/10">In total, Newport City Homes has only 1,264 one-bedroom properties and 2,600 two-bedroom properties. Today on the common housing register website&#8212;Newport housing options&#8212;only 32 properties are advertised. There are very few smaller properties. The point has been made that whole estates in Wales have very few one or two-bedroom properties. In the past we needed larger properties, so that is what councils built. The scarcity of larger properties may be a problem in big cities in England, but in Wales there is a scarcity of smaller properties. There is simply nowhere to move to. As Community Housing Cymru has said,</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/11">&#8220;the option of tenants downsizing would prove difficult in almost all cases&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/12">The other option is to pay more. As the excellent report by the Bron Afon housing association in Torfaen highlights&#8212;I hope that the Minister has looked at it&#8212;many of those affected consider themselves to be just surviving already. Many are like the man I met on an estate last week, who said that he left the heating off until tea time because the price of food was going up every week and he did not want to go into debt. A family in the Bron Afon study, which surveyed all its tenants, concluded that the only solution was to eat two fewer meals a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.366.0/13">As the study showed, people want to stay in their own homes, not least because they are the homes in which they brought up their children, where they may have lost a partner and where they have memories and have lived for years. They may have had them adapted and they may also have family ties and help with child care. These are their homes. In Community Housing Cyrmu&#8217;s survey of people affected, 13% said that they would consider downsizing, 8% that they might consider a lodger and 79% that neither of those options was suitable and that they would apply for the discretionary housing payments, which is where the problems arise.</p>

	<p pid="b.368.0/1">My hon. Friend is making the case well that this is a tax on the poorest. It is not about freeing up housing or downsizing. In my local authority, 824 tenants are affected but just 48 may be rehoused. Despite that, the Government describe this decision as morally right. But it is about punishing the poor.</p>

	<p pid="b.368.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend&#8217;s excellent and powerful point.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.1/2">According to the Trussell Trust, the huge increase in the use of food banks is due in no small part to the benefit changes. Some 42% of those who turn up for their three-day supply of food are not able to balance their budgets because of benefit delays, mistakes, sanctions or reviews. Front-line professionals have to give a reason for a referral to a food bank and problems with welfare are increasingly being cited.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.1/3">With food inflation above 4% and increases in energy and petrol costs, it will be impossible for many people on low incomes to absorb the additional housing costs. Rent arrears will increase and housing associations might struggle to deal with that. The Welsh Tenants Federation estimates that 10% of tenants are already in debt to their social landlord and that a rent increase on top of those rent arrears could result in 4,000 people</p>
	<p pid="b.368.1/4">presenting themselves as homeless. Newport city council in my area estimates that there will be a 5% increase in homelessness next year.</p>
	<p pid="b.368.1/5">The Government&#8217;s answer to those who cannot move is that the discretionary housing payment will deal with all the issues. Newport is getting &#163;343,000 of discretionary housing payment and Monmouthshire &#163;121,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.369.5/1">My hon. Friend is right that private rent is higher. I will come to that point later.</p>
	<p pid="b.369.5/2">Although Monmouthshire Housing Association is getting &#163;121,000 in discretionary housing payments, it forecasts that its rent arrears will be about &#163;225,000. The Government have set a budget without knowing whether it will be sufficient and are hiding behind it when asked difficult questions. That is as callous as the bedroom tax itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.369.5/3">If there is no social housing and a person cannot afford to stay in their home, renting privately might be the only option. However, it is an expensive one. Given that the stated aim of the policy is to save money, the policy clearly has no logic. Although the Government do not seem to care about the human impact of the policy, they might at least look at this issue. A cursory look at the property in my area illustrates the point. The policy is more expensive, even with a reduced local housing allowance. In the Bron Afon study, every single property in Torfaen is more expensive than housing association properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.369.5/4">Not only will the policy cost more money; the impact on families cannot be overestimated. It is a profound change that will have profound effects. People will have</p>
	<p pid="b.369.5/5">to move away from family members who provide child care, there will be no help for those who foster and the disabled will be hit yet again.</p>

	<p pid="b.370.1/1">I will carry on because I believe that the hon. Lady will be speaking later.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/2">This policy will cause family breakdown. That was illustrated graphically to me by two local cases. The first is that of a divorced father in a two-bedroom house who has his kids to stay at the weekend. As he is under 35 he might be expected to share accommodation, with all the child protection issues that that raises. The second case is a mother of four who was rehoused after great turmoil resulting from domestic violence. She now has to uproot herself and her children who are settled in school because one of her children has moved out and the age of the two youngest means that they have to share one room&#8212;the definition of a box room, I presume, being a spare room.</p>
	<p pid="b.370.1/3">There are many issues and no time to do them justice. So far, the Government&#8217;s response has been to shrug their shoulders and tell housing associations to be creative. In my experience, housing associations&#8212;unlike the Minister&#8212;have spoken to their tenants and know the reality. Alongside local authorities and the Welsh Assembly Government housing associations are being creative, but all the creativity in the world cannot alleviate the basic problem that there is no social housing, and payments to local authorities do not even begin to address the issue. If this measure is about saving money it will surely fail.</p>

Will they call on their Front-Bench spokesman to commit that a Labour manifesto would reverse this measure? That is very much what I am hearing from the Labour party and I think all Labour Members who speak in this debate must say where they stand.</p>

The Labour party aspires to be the next Government of this country and claims that it is credible on economic matters such as balancing the budget and addressing the deficit. The moment of truth is fast approaching and the Labour party must say what it would do about some of these measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.371.7/1">No, I want to develop this point a bit further. The Government have put forward a lot of measures. No one would claim that they are all perfect and thoughtful contributions were made earlier in the debate about areas that the Government need to address. That could be through discretionary housing payment or the rolling review&#8212;I welcome the Minister&#8217;s reference to that because it is sensible to say that a policy such as this should be kept under review so that the Government can move swiftly to take any action that might be needed.

My strong suspicion is that reality will dawn on Labour Front Benchers as we approach the election, and they will start to make speeches that begin to reflect something like the economic reality that Britain faces. At that point, the Labour Back Benchers who sit in the Chamber week after week relishing the opportunity to oppose everything and say that the Government&#8217;s measures are dreadful must make difficult decisions.

Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill, who spoke for Labour, if Labour had begun to address some of the structural deficit problems when the financial crash hit in 2008, the current Government might not have had to take some of the difficult decisions they are taking now.

	<p pid="b.372.7/1">I do not know how the hon. Gentleman can begin to criticise Wandsworth council, which has just set the lowest council tax in the country&#8212;it has done so for many years in a row. The difference between Wandsworth council&#8217;s band E tax and that of many surrounding councils, and particularly that of many high-spending Labour councils, is enormous&#8212;it is the equivalent of a family holiday, a new car or a new three-piece suite. That illustrates the benefit of low tax and leaving people with more of their own money to spend on what they will. I am glad the hon. Gentleman gave me the opportunity to pay tribute to Wandsworth council&#8217;s low council tax policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.7/2">Some of my constituents will be affected by the measure&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I realise that other hon. Members want to speak, but if Labour Members want to make every general economic point and make endless reference to tax cuts for millionaires and that sort of thing&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Well, I made the point earlier that the Labour Government had several years after the financial crash and after financial reality had dawned to do something about the upper rate of tax, but they did nothing. The higher rate was in effect for, I believe, 37 days before the election. A lot of nonsense is spoken about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.7/3">As I have said, we could look at aspects of the measure. The Minister&#8217;s speech was helpful because he clarified concerns and misunderstandings. The measure draws attention to the fact that subsidised social housing is a scant and important public resource. The fact that subsidy is built in to the rent for social housing means that social housing is often not appreciated as a valuable resource, and we should aim to provide access to it for as many taxpayers as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.372.7/4">I would like to make a point on behalf of the many people who come to see me who are over-occupying. No one claims that this policy will free up all of the 1 million rooms, but it might well encourage people to look at being in appropriate-sized accommodation. Many housing directors tell me that if they could match people to the correct-sized accommodation, they could resolve much of their waiting lists&#8212;that is what I have been told by people with many years&#8217; experience in this field. This is not a panacea, but there are people in wrong-sized accommodation. If this measure starts to get people thinking and encourages them to move into right-sized accommodation where it is available, that is a good thing.</p>

	<p pid="b.374.1/1">Let me finish this point. I have checked with my council and it is the case that council tenants, as long as they do not either overcrowd or sub-let the lease, are able to take in a lodger if they so choose. For some people that might be a sensible solution. That might help the young single people who come and see me, and to whom I can give no suggestions about where they might find socially subsidised housing.

There is an extra &#163;30 million of discretionary housing allowance, and my council has certainly seen a significant rise in its discretionary amount. It has already put together a co-ordinated action plan between the finance and housing departments. It has contacted all potentially affected recipients and customers, and is beginning to confirm their benefit details. It has set up a helpline to discuss options to downsize. It is in direct contact with some of those households. It is also in direct contact with some of the social landlords to look at where there might be work that they could do. We heard an interesting example earlier about how social landlords in Liverpool had come together to try and pool their resources. There are quite a lot of sensible things that local councils that are planning ahead can do, and, of course, some people will choose to take other options.</p>
	<p pid="b.374.1/3">I make this plea to Opposition Members. I would like to think that when they are approached by people with specific difficulties, especially associated with disability and so on, their first thought is not, &#8220;This would be an ideal case to read out in Prime Minister&#8217;s Question Time&#8221;&#8212;we have heard this in respect of many other welfare changes, particularly from the Labour party&#8212;but to say, &#8220;You might well be covered by the discretionary payment, and I&#8217;m going to make inquiries about that and exercise my influence to say that you should be.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.375.2/1">I pay tribute to the powerful opening speech by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/2">On the Opposition Benches, it is not a question of shroud-waving, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40064" name="Jane Ellison">the hon. Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison)</phrase> suggested, but a recognition of the people we see in our surgeries week in, week out. The fear of this measure is such that people believe it to be a bedroom tax, a cruel and counter-productive measure from a Government intent on punishing the poor. It is cruel because it is likely to lead to more evictions, homelessness, disruption and despair and because it takes no account of people&#8217;s real circumstances&#8212;as we have heard many times, more than two thirds of those affected are likely to be people with disabilities&#8212;and it is counter-productive because it is highly unlikely to lead to the outcomes that the Government claim to want. Not only are there insufficient smaller properties for families to move to, but the measure is more likely to cost money than save it. Evictions are not only hugely painful, but hugely costly, estimated at about &#163;10,000 a time.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/3">As has been revealed in this debate, the truly cynical nature of the proposal was revealed by the Government&#8217;s own impact assessment, which made it clear that the projected savings will be made only if tenants remain in their existing homes and make up the shortfall in benefits themselves. In other words, the money that this measure is supposed to raise will be raised only if the stated policy aim of getting people to move house does not actually work. That is immensely cynical. The truth is that many people are struggling in such desperate circumstances that they simply cannot find the extra money to pay.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/4">The bottom line is that we have a major housing crisis, with nowhere near enough affordable homes. In my own constituency, for example, more than 15,000 households are on Brighton and Hove&#8217;s waiting list, but just 750 properties become available every year. It is successive Governments who have caused this housing crisis, not the poor who struggle to cope with it. It is not the fault of people who cannot get a job, of disabled people, of people who share the care of their children or of foster parents. The crucial problem&#8212;this is where the fault lies&#8212;is the epic failure of both the Tories and new Labour on council housing. The Tories pushed the decimation of the stock with the right to buy, ignoring the right to rent, and new Labour tweaked the enormous discounts but did not grasp the nettle and build council housing. For example, in 2007-08, only 350 new council homes were built. It is deeply unjust to penalise people who are struggling at the bottom of a housing market over which they have little or no control.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/5">Ministers give blas&#233; answers to serious parliamentary questions about this nasty measure. They say, &#8220;Get a job, get a lodger or move somewhere else.&#8221; They ignore the fact that, for many people, those options are simply not possible. On average, five people are chasing every vacancy&#8212;in some places, the figure is much higher&#8212;so how are those jobs suddenly going to appear? As other hon. Members have pointed out, the rooms in question are often too small to rent out, or not &#8220;spare&#8221; at all. Ministers have suggested that social landlords might want to redefine a property as having fewer rooms when the spare room is extremely small, but we know that most social landlords cannot reduce their rents because they need the money for repairs and for servicing the debts they have for building more stock.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/6">What will happen to the person with severe mental health problems who has been settled for years and who is deeply distressed by change but who has a tiny box room? They cannot take a lodger because of their unpredictable episodes, they cannot afford the rent because of the box room and there is no smaller property available locally. What is supposed to happen to them?</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/7">I have not yet heard Ministers deny the existence of the acute housing crisis, yet they conveniently attack the people who are facing the worst end of it. They also overlook the cumulative impact of so many cuts. In Brighton and Hove, practically every household affected by the bedroom tax will also be affected by the Government-imposed cut to the council tax benefit budget, and a good proportion of them will also be hit by the changes to disability living allowance. Changes to the scope of what is covered under legal aid from April will mean that benefit issues will not be covered, so there will be less opportunity for people to receive in-depth advice or to challenge decisions in court.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/8">This pernicious policy will not scratch the surface of our overcrowding crisis, as it will simply create new housing emergencies for people who were previously just managing to get by. The local authority in Brighton estimates that the total cost of an eviction process, including temporary accommodation, is around &#163;10,000 per eviction. The Government say that it will not come to that, but they are simply not in touch with reality. Of the 1,000 or so households affected in Brighton and Hove, the majority are already struggling with rent arrears of around &#163;2 a week. Where on earth are they supposed to magic a further &#163;16 a week in bedroom tax from?</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/9">A constituent who is desperately worried about the bedroom tax came to my surgery last week. She shares custody of her daughter, so the room that she has for her daughter is seen as spare. She simply does not have the money to pay the tax being levied on her. In order to open Ministers&#8217; eyes to the daily reality that some of my constituents face, I would like to read out a short amount of a testimony written by her. She says:</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/10">&#8220;I have no more basics to cut back on. I go without meals. I cannot afford the bus, toiletries, a newspaper. I wear trousers most days as I cannot afford to replace my pair of tights should they get laddered. If I had not been able to overcome my pride and seek help I do not know how my family would survive. It was difficult to overcome the sense of shame I felt for needing to turn to charity for support in meeting the family&#8217;s most basic needs. I do voluntary work in the community myself. This did not match my own sense of who I am but it is my reality and has to be faced. I now see those others who also depend on the food banks and support from charities like the City Mission in a new light. I see their resilience and humanity. We are the same.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/11">I was in tears by the end of my meeting with her.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/12">We are talking about real people in real homes who are feeling real desperation, and the criticism that we are somehow exaggerating the situation is an insult to those constituents who come to see us. Ministers are recklessly and deliberately ignoring the harsh reality for the majority of those surviving on benefits. They are deliberately pandering to media stereotypes. How convenient it is to say that it is all the fault of the workshy, swanning about with all that spare space&#8212;or so the mean and mistaken narrative goes.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/13">Going back to reality, the homes of a lot of the people affected by this policy are not too big for their needs. Their homes meet their needs, from the padded box room that a single mother uses to keep her autistic son safe when he is having an episode, to the extra room used by a disabled person to store their equipment, and to the room used for half the week by the child whose parents are separated.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/14">There are many reasons why what appears to the Government to be spare space is in fact not spare at all, but essential. It will always be possible to find a small number of examples of people who genuinely have more space than they need, but that does not justify the Government&#8217;s crass blanket policy. The experts are saying that if we want to help people into smaller properties, we should give them support, sensitively, to find the right property. We should not force them out with the threat of eviction. We also know that the right kind of properties often do not exist. I asked a parliamentary question to find out whether the Government had carried out an assessment of how many appropriate smaller properties existed. They have not done any such assessment, because they do not care. Then, when we put that argument to them, they will come back and tell us that the discretionary housing payments are supposedly a magic wand that will solve all problems. The pot of discretionary housing payment is tiny compared to the cuts being made. It is obvious that demand will massively outstrip supply.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/15">In Brighton and Hove, for example, the projected housing benefit shortfall has been modelled by the local authority as over &#163;12 million, including shortfall from cuts to local housing allowance, bedroom tax and the benefit cap. The Government have given a DHP pot of just over &#163;1 million to the city. That covers only about 8% of the housing benefit cuts that people will face. The DHP is tiny and nowhere near adequate.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/16">The Government try to justify these cuts on the grounds that they are &#8220;making work pay&#8221;, but when Ministers use that phrase, it is really a code for punishing people for being poor. Of course work should pay; we need decent living wages pay, not poverty pay. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40064" name="Jane Ellison">The hon. Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison)</phrase> talks about the need to cut the housing benefit budget, but one way to do that would be to pay a decent living wage in the first place. It is not the fault of people who cannot get a job or who are unable to work that employers do not pay people properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/17">There will be a potential push to move people from social housing to different sized private sector accommodation, which does not have the same security of tenure and could cost more. What the Government should be doing is massively increasing the supply of affordable, sustainable, decent homes and legislating to allow for far greater security of tenure, which would go some way to holding rents down. The bottom line is that the Government must stop relying on the profit motive to supply housing for people who are poor; it will take time, but we absolutely need to fund a real programme of sustainable mass council housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/18">This Government, however, are going in the opposite direction. This is a policy that will lead to bad debts and eviction, and will dramatically undermine the financial stability of the social housing model. If we combine that with the Government&#8217;s refusal to allow people the choice to pay their housing benefit directly to the landlord under universal credit, we genuinely have a recipe for the end of social housing. As landlords are faced with the lose-lose situation of either accumulating bad debt as people simply cannot pay the tax, or facing the even higher cost of debt collection and eviction, the long-term future of social housing looks bleak. How unjust this will look in the history books when the banks get bailed out and the poor get thrown out.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.2/19">Before Government Members challenge me by asking how we would pay for this investment, let me say that I am not afraid of saying that it is perfectly legitimate to borrow to invest. The idea that that is somehow irresponsible, coming from this Government who have now led us into the triple-dip recession, is an absolute irony. I do not know what the Labour Front-Bench team will say on this issue, but I have no compunction about saying that it is absolutely right to borrow to invest in affordable housing and in the kind of infrastructure that we need in the 21st century. The idea that, as a Government, as a nation, as a European Union of nations, the best way of addressing the deficit is by everybody cutting spending and draining demand out of the economy has been proved to be wrong over and over again. More and more economists are saying that, too. I hope that, for the sake of us all, this Government wake up and see that very soon.</p>

	<p pid="b.378.2/1">This issue is creating a lot of passion, which I can understand. People&#8217;s homes are very important to them, and none of</p>
	<p pid="b.378.2/2">us wants to feel that the possession of our home is threatened or is subject to high-handed control from above. The morality of the argument, however, is not all on one side as the Opposition seem to suggest it is. Indeed, I would find their moral outrage more convincing if their Front-Bench team firmly pledged to repeal this measure if they were ever returned to office. I would also find it more convincing if when they were in office they had not taken the steps they did on private sector rented accommodation, probably as a prelude to going further.</p>
	<p pid="b.378.2/3">On the basis of what the more moderate Opposition Members have said, they accept that there is a problem of under-occupation where free or subsidised accommodation is made available through the public sector. The morality on the Government side of the case is to say that we have obligations to all those people who want that subsidised or free accommodation but who cannot get it on the size and scale they need. There are two different groups here, and we need to look after the interests of both groups as best we can.</p>
	<p pid="b.378.2/4">Of course there are visionaries on the Opposition side who say that the answer is easy: we just need to build hundreds of thousands of more homes at public expense so that everybody can have the accommodation they want. The issue then becomes why that did not happen when we had a Labour Government who knew how to do those things. The truth is that for anyone who sits on the Government Benches, such housing will always be a scarcer resource than people would like. If we offer something free or subsidised, there will be more demand than provision, even when we are trying to be very generous, so we must have rationing and allocation. All Governments, in good times and bad times, have had to allocate and ration public housing.</p>

	<p pid="b.379.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman not realise that there was a period&#8212;certainly in Wigan&#8212;when we could not let council houses and they were knocked down, because people were buying houses? Our biggest problem now is that people who want to buy houses cannot get mortgages.

	<p pid="b.379.1/1">It is a bit of both. I entirely agree with the hon. Lady if she is urging the Government to do even more than they are currently doing to make more mortgages available so that more people can afford to buy homes. Members on both sides of the House would welcome that. I happen to know that Ministers are desperate to ensure that more mortgages are available than were available during the last few Labour years, and are working away with the banks to try to make it happen. That is very much part of the solution to the housing problem. <i>[Laughter.] </i>It is all very well for Labour Members to go into fits of hysterics, but they really should try to take a serious interest in the problem. Believe it or not, quite a lot of us Conservatives want better housing solutions for many of our constituents, and for people in other parts of the country.</p>

	<p pid="b.380.0/1">I seem to remember that the Conservative Government did indeed honour their pledge&#8212;and that was many more homes than the Labour Government were building each year&#8212;but, even in those days, why did they need to do it? They needed to do it because we were short of homes. It was the post-war period, the Germans had remodelled many of our housing estates, and trying to create the homes that people needed was a big problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.380.0/2">I think that under-occupation is a problem, and I think that the Government have come up with one part of the answer, but I urge Ministers to listen carefully to all those who are saying that the positive way of proceeding is through incentive, encouragement, persuasion, and giving people a better answer than the one they currently have, which may be a larger property that may not be suitable.</p>
	<p pid="b.380.0/3">The Government have excluded everyone of pension age from the proposals, and I welcome that. I think that it is smart politics, and very sensitive to the elderly population. However, in my constituency, where most people own their homes&#8212;elderly people tend to own them without mortgages, and younger people tend to own them with rather big and difficult mortgages&#8212;a good many elderly residents decide to sell the family home because it has become too big and unmanageable, and to buy a smaller property such as a flat or bungalow. Many then sell again when they are becoming more frail, and move to semi-sheltered or supported accommodation.</p>
	<p pid="b.380.0/4">That is a natural process of trading down in the private sector, but there is sometimes too much of an obstacle for elderly people in social housing to be able to do the same. Perhaps not enough of the right properties are available; perhaps they are not offered in the right way; perhaps there should be some incentive. I think it perfectly acceptable to try to create an atmosphere in which there can be the same sensible mobility in public sector housing as occurs naturally in areas with rather more private sector housing, so that elderly people can have housing more suited to their needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.380.0/5">I hope that Ministers will consider the question of elderly under-occupation, which I think is very much part of the story, but will do so in a positive way that encourages, promotes and helps, rather than removing benefit or imposing a tax. I wish that the Opposition understood the meaning of the word &#8220;tax&#8221;. Imposing a tax means taking money from people who are earning it for themselves; it does not mean paying them less benefit. I hope that Ministers will work out an answer to that soundbite. I have heard soundbite arguments before, but I congratulate the Labour party on thinking up a brilliant and misleading one. I am afraid that it is better than the soundbites we have heard so far from this side of the House, and I urge my hon. Friends to come up with a soundbite that represents the truth. This is not a bedroom tax, but a reduction in the amount of benefit paid, which is very different.</p>

	<p pid="b.381.0/1">I am afraid that I cannot give way again. I am running out of time, and if I give way I will not be given any injury time.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.0/2">We need to look at the issue of under-occupation among the elderly, and we need then to look at the issue of the disabled. That was why I approached this debate with considerable nervousness. As I think my hon. Friends know, I wish us to be more generous to the disabled, not less generous, and I think we all feel a little nervous about how far we should go. I was somewhat reassured to see that there are different definitions of disability and a rather wider definition is being used than would, perhaps, be normal. I am interested in the people who are seriously disabled, as recognised through the receipt of disability benefit.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.0/3">I urge my ministerial friends to be as generous as possible. We must not presume that there is an easy solution, however. Again, if there are issues that need to be sorted out, the best way to do that is through support and persuasion and offering people something better. That must be the aim. Why would somebody move if their new home is going to be worse than their current one? If it can be shown that there would be better, more appropriate and better supported accommodation, however, I might be more willing to accept that we should follow the proposed course of action. I urge my ministerial friends to be extremely careful about the definition of the disability category, however.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.0/4">One Opposition Member argued that this is a cynical policy and there might not be many savings if it works. That is a misunderstanding of the true nature of the policy. It is not primarily a public spending-cut policy; it is a policy designed to try to get more people into public sector housing that is suitable for them. That is the bigger picture.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.0/5">We have an inadequate amount of housing stock, and some people have more of it than they strictly need, whereas others do not have as much of it as they strictly, technically need on the needs definition. We are arguing here about the balance between those two groups, and whether it would be feasible to solve the overall shortage by producing more housing. Even the Labour party must understand that if we were to go for the big build answer, that would take several years to come through. Ministers are feeling very frustrated at present that they have identified places for building and the means of financing that building, but it is taking a very long time to get the building to come through so we can start to tackle this problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.0/6">My next topic is how to tackle the problems of insufficient housing and excess welfare spending. The issue of eligibility is key. My constituents tell me that they feel much more inclined to pay taxes to make sure that people who have been settled in this country for many years, or who have been born and brought up here, can get access to proper housing than to provide housing for people who have only just arrived and seem to know how to work the system to get access to housing. The Government could productively focus on that. I am sure there will be European Union rules, but we need to negotiate on this with our European partners, and make a stand if necessary, because there is a strong feeling in our country that public housing will be limited&#8212;more limited than some would like&#8212;and if we are to make choices, the priority must be those who have been here for some time and who have made a contribution</p>
	<p pid="b.381.0/7">and are part of our settled community. That does not always seem to be the case. I hope Ministers will see the issue of eligibility as a proper avenue for addressing both excess benefit expenditure and the shortage of available property.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.0/8">These are difficult waters. Anyone who looks at the situation rationally will agree that there is under-occupation and we need to tackle it sensitively. They will also agree that we need more housing provision overall, and we need to do what we can to tackle that. I hope we can all agree that the best answer is to find a way to enable more people to enjoy what every MP takes for granted. We take it for granted that we have a well-paid job and that we can afford to buy a house. I think that every MP owns a property. Indeed, some of them own rather more than one property, I believe, and that has sometimes become a matter of comment. It is normal for an MP to own a property&#8212;to be an owner-occupier&#8212;and to enjoy a good income, and I am sure most MPs own a spare room or two.</p>
	<p pid="b.381.0/9">I do not think there is anything wrong with people striving, getting a better job, earning more money and having spare rooms. I am personally very much in favour of spare rooms when people can afford to have them. We also need to make sure we have a fair tax system so that we are all making a decent contribution to those who cannot afford spare rooms.</p>

	<p pid="b.382.4/1">I have been struck by a number of things said by Government Members today. First, I noted the mechanical usage of the almost robotic mantras of, &#8220;1 million spare rooms&#8221;, &#8220;under-occupancy&#8221; and &#8220;utilisation&#8221; and an almost</p>
	<p pid="b.382.4/2">frighteningly casual disregard of the fact that they were talking about people&#8217;s family homes. These are places where people have brought up children and may have lived for decades, and, as a result, have created the stable, safe and supportive communities we all want to see. Those are now to be torn asunder for the sake of a money-saving measure&#8212;that is what it is&#8212;which will not work. The extraordinary thing is that the bedroom tax works only if the policy fails. If everybody could move to what the Government consider to be a &#8220;properly sized property&#8221;, the housing benefit costs would probably be identical to what they are today&#8212;not one penny would be saved. The tax will work only if people cannot move and they give the Government this extra money, over and above what they already pay to stay in their family home.</p>

	<p pid="b.383.0/1">That is not necessarily the case. If people who need more rooms and are currently living in the private sector move into the social housing sector, while the people in the social housing sector who need fewer rooms move into the private sector, there will be a substantial saving.</p>

	<p pid="b.383.1/1">Unless, of course, we factor in the fact that rents in the private sector are dearer, and we have heard evidence that would rather contradict the assertion made elegantly by the hon. Gentleman.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.1/2">Another thing that struck me was <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40338" name="Kris Hopkins">the hon. Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins)</phrase>, who is not in his place, saying that he wanted more facts and less scaremongering. That is very sensible; I am all in favour of evidence-based policy making. What he and others have then done is to say that a discretionary payments system is available to help. That confirms that those who live in specially adapted accessible housing are not exempt and that foster carer families are not automatically exempt. By asking for more facts and less scaremongering, and then talking about discretionary payments, which, by their nature, may not be available, particularly if the pot runs out, these people are confirming the lack of exemptions that make this bedroom tax as nasty as Opposition Members think it is.</p>

	<p pid="b.383.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is making an important point about the discretionary nature of this policy, particularly in relation to foster parents. I have been contacted by a foster parent who was contacted by their housing association to say that rooms where people are cared for are counted as spare rooms, but they did not know anything about the existence of the discretionary payment. Such people are reliant on at least two or three levels of communication to get the discretionary payment, so surely it would be much better if foster parents were completely exempt.</p>

	<p pid="b.383.3/1">I agree entirely with the hon. Gentleman. In the meanwhile&#8212;until that happens&#8212;communication should of course be better and foster carer families should be encouraged to apply now, in advance, if that is possible. He rightly says that this policy should simply be scrapped because it will not work and, as far as I can see, it is only punitive. That is certainly also the view of the Scottish Government, who feel that it will have an appalling impact on families throughout Scotland and, indeed, the rest of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.3/2">That assessment also shows that eight out of 10&#8212;the exact figure is 79%&#8212;of the households in Scotland set to be hit by this change, as we have heard before, contain an adult with a recognised disability. That is extraordinary. This is about as punitive as it could be&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The Minister of State is muttering, &#8220;Do they need a spare bedroom?&#8221; He is using the robotic mantra again, suggesting that somehow it is evil to have a spare bedroom. There are very good reasons for having spare bedrooms and I shall come to some of them later.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.3/3">I know that the Minister for Housing and Welfare in the Scottish Government has warned the UK Government of the impact of this change. The Scottish Government have highlighted to the Government the disproportionate effect on disabled people and have asked them to rethink their policy. We understood before the start of the debate that the Secretary of State had instructed a rethink on part of the policy, and that is to be welcomed. However, we have found out that we will have a rolling review after the policy starts, which might not report until two years after commencement.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.3/4">The numbers I have show that people with two spare rooms will pay an extra &#163;20 a week, or more than &#163;1,000 a year. They could be &#163;2,000 down before the Government&#8217;s review reports back and says that those rooms are not really spare at all, because one of the sons is serving in Afghanistan. Alternatively, he will not be able to come back to the family home because they will have been forced to move. That is the kind of issue the Government are failing to take into consideration&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> The Minister is still muttering, but he will not get to his feet to say anything. I am sure that when he was at university, he was more than happy to go home to his family house. Why should working-class children whose houses are part-funded by housing benefit not be able to go back to their family home because of the nature of their tenure? That is ridiculous.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.3/5">Other groups are affected, of course, such as tenants who are willing to move to smaller properties and are waiting for one to become available, but who will lose out in the meantime; the parents of foster children; and parents who live separately and look after their children. The final category concerns me greatly. I have already been contacted by a constituent&#8212;one of many. He is separated from his wife, which is sadly not uncommon, and has two daughters in their late teens. This gentleman is so careful that he does not switch the heating on in his very modest apartment unless there are guests. He counts every penny.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.3/6">His wife has primary caring responsibility for the two children, but one or both of his daughters stays with him up to four nights a week. That will become impossible without the second bedroom, and even if he could find a smaller property it is highly unlikely&#8212;almost impossible, in fact&#8212;that he would be able to do so within the community in which he and the rest of his family live. That means that the relationship between him and his children will wither, because contact will become far less possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.3/7">The Government do not understand the appalling impact this tax will have. The fact that eight out of 10 of the households that will be hit include an adult with a disability is compelling evidence that the UK Government must reconsider, and quickly.</p>
	<p pid="b.383.3/8">As I said earlier, not only disabled people but many others will be forced to pay. I want to raise two specific cases with the Minister. The first is that of a woman&#8212;a pensioner who will not herself be affected&#8212;who cares for her severely disabled adult son. He lives in his own apartment, which has two bedrooms. That is not his fault; it is the one he was allocated. He has a severe psychological condition and needs to be cared for every day, and his mother carries out those caring responsibilities. If he is forced to move, the trauma will be extraordinary. If he manages to get through that, the fact that his mother has medical conditions of her own means she will be unable to carry out her caring responsibilities if her son is forced to move even a few streets away. The real-life impact on that family in that part of that community will be horrendous. I am deeply disturbed that the Government have not thought this through properly.</p>

	<p pid="b.385.1/1">I am extremely well aware of that.

	<p pid="b.386.1/1">The hon. Gentleman sums up the situation nicely. The discretionary pot is too small. I do not dislike discretion generally&#8212;I think it is quite helpful&#8212;but there are too many categories of people who should be fully exempt but who will be subjected to the tender mercies of discretionary decision making, which may go against them when it ought not to.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.1/2">In short, this remains a very bad policy with too many of the wrong people suffering a very bad impact, and it must be reversed. It risks destabilising communities; it disproportionately hits disabled people; it puts the burden of paying the cost of this Government&#8217;s economic failure on the backs of some of the poorest in society. That, I think, tells us everything we need to know about the Tory-Liberal Government, many of whom&#8212;most of whom, I suspect, or perhaps even all&#8212;have not been poor and, more important, do not understand what it means to be poor in society today.</p>

	<p pid="b.386.2/1">It is a great pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> and to have listened to this debate. When the nationalists have an Opposition day, it is always a reassurance to those of us who are Unionists, because by their presence in the Chamber they show how much better off we are together than separate. I should like to thank them for their contribution to our parliamentary democracy and hope that they will stay with us for ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.2/2">I am pleased to be able to speak in support of the Government&#8217;s position, which is fair, measured and just. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> put it rightly when he said that we have to think about our constituents who want social housing because they have a family and need an extra bedroom, but whom we cannot help because there is a house being lived in by one person, who has too many rooms, and there is no pressure on that person to move. We hear a lot from Opposition Members about fairness for one side of the equation, but nothing about fairness for the other side, which is avoided and cast aside. When housing is controlled by the state, we must be fair to everybody, whichever side of the equation they are on. There are those who have large families, live in small accommodation, or are living in the private rented sector, and cannot get into social housing or council housing because of the problem of under-occupancy, which, we have discovered from the Government, amounts to 1 million bedrooms. Just think how many of our constituents could have better housing if only those bedrooms were freed up.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.2/3">The Government&#8217;s position is also measured, because they have put in discretionary powers to look after people who will be in particularly difficult circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.2/4">Discretion is very important; the Government have got that spot on. If we were to say that every house that had been adapted in any way for a disabled person were to be exempt, we would find that a property with a little ramp, or one handrail, was suddenly exempt, and the whole policy would be removed. By applying discretion, however, we get the overwhelming majority of the benefit of the policy, without putting a heavy burden on that small number of people who genuinely ought to be exempt and protected. The same applies to the &#163;5 million that has been made available to families who foster. If fostering had a general exemption, everybody in receipt of social housing benefit would suddenly go off to the council and say that they wanted to be on the fostering lists, so that they would not have to give up their extra bedroom, but would then refuse any child who was sent to them. If broad exemptions are used, people will try to fit the categories of exemption provided, whereas using discretion ensures that people must bring forward a reasonable case to encourage those who have the discretion to accept that they ought to be allowed to receive the extra funding to maintain their current position.</p>
	<p pid="b.386.2/5">The Government&#8217;s position is also just, because we must ask ourselves what benefits are for. Are they there to allow people perpetually to remain in dependence on the state&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.387.0/1">The hon. Gentleman displays a total ignorance of this policy area, and I am sorry about that. First, the bedroom tax applies to people who are in work as well as to those who are out of work. Secondly, it applies to people on benefits who cannot work.</p>

	<p pid="b.387.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady, but even if people cannot work, they can take in a lodger, and can get &#163;20 coming in without any effect on their benefit, so they can be better off, because the average that would be lost for one room is &#163;14. The Government have a policy that makes people who are not in work potentially better off, and those who are in work can also be better off, because they will similarly be able to take in lodgers, but they might be able to move to cheaper housing, which they can afford to pay for themselves, rather than being dependent on the state.</p>

	<p pid="b.387.2/1">As usual my hon. Friend makes an excellent series of points. As well as the option for those who cannot work of taking a lodger, does he agree that for those people who can work, and are in some work, in many cases the sums involved would require only two hours of the minimum wage per week to make up the difference?</p>

	<p pid="b.387.3/1">I am sympathetic to what my hon. Friend says, but I think that people need to be able to take responsibility for themselves and to make choices for themselves. The choice they have is either to maintain the benefit they need for the housing they need, or to stay in housing where they have an extra room and adjust their behaviour accordingly. It is not for the state, putting its expenditure on the backs of hard-pressed taxpayers, to fund indefinitely people&#8217;s lifestyle choices, and it is a choice if people decide to have an extra room</p>
	<p pid="b.387.3/2">that they are not actually using; they can choose whether to move to a smaller property or, under this new policy, to find a way of getting the extra income they need.</p>

	<p pid="b.388.0/1">If someone living in social housing wishes to downsize and move to a smaller house, I take it&#8212;I ask my hon. Friend or the Minister to confirm this&#8212;that they would not have to find the costs in their own budget and that they would be helped to move.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.388.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" speakername="Jacob Rees-Mogg" colnum="388"  time="016:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#130227-0003.htm_spnew45">
	<p pid="b.388.1/1">Owing to pressure on the availability of larger properties, many social landlords provide significant incentives for people to move.</p>
	<p pid="b.388.1/2">It is important to remember that the housing market is dynamic. It is not a static market, with people staying in the same house their whole lives, and they should not expect that to be the case. I understand that people move house, on average, every seven years. It is perfectly reasonable that that happens, and that it should continue to happen, because it frees up the properties people need. I intervened on the hon. Member for Dundee East to make that important point.</p>
	<p pid="b.388.1/3">When a three or four-bedroom property in the social rented sector is freed up, it might well be filled by someone who had been living in the private rented sector, which is more expensive, so they will be moving into the cheaper social rented sector. The person who had been living in the three or four-bedroom property might move back into the private rented sector, which has a higher cost, but there would be a bigger saving because the other person had moved into the social rented sector. That is important, because some of the debate has focused on the inflexibility of the housing market. It has been said, for example, that there are not enough one-bedroom properties in the social rented sector for people to move down to, but there are plenty of properties across the country as a whole. People will move more freely between the private and public rented sectors and will continue to have their rents paid for them unless they choose, as they will be free to do, to earn more money by working a few more hours a week or by taking in a lodger and so on in order to get the extra income.</p>

	<p pid="b.388.2/1">May I ask the hon. Gentleman&#8212;he is making the speech, but this applies to everyone on the Government Benches&#8212;whether he can imagine asking his mother, sister, brother, daughter or son to take in a stranger as a lodger?</p>

	<p pid="b.388.5/1">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Lady. It had not been my intention to tell anecdotes about my personal circumstances, but my house in London has four bedrooms with seven people living in</p>
	<p pid="b.388.5/2">it, three adults and four children, so I think that I meet the requirements for maximum occupancy and would not be expected to give up a single room. I am grateful to her for allowing me to illustrate my relatively straitened circumstances, which I had not expected to be able to do.</p>
	<p pid="b.388.5/3">It is perfectly reasonable for people to live in a house or flat that is suitable for the number of occupants and to ask for that when paying out benefits. Indeed, it is morally right to do so, because every benefit that is paid is money that has come from a taxpayer this year or, through borrowing, will come from a taxpayer in future years.</p>
	<p pid="b.388.5/4">People pay taxes on very, very low earnings. Even benefit recipients have to pay value added tax, but people click into national insurance at &#163;107 a week of earnings. Are we really saying to those on low earnings, &#8220;You must subsidise for ever people who live in houses that are too big for them as their children grow and go and they find eventually that they are the only person there&#8221;? Will that same house be funded for ever on the backs of hard-pressed taxpayers, when in fact there is a perfectly reasonable and sensitive way of dealing with the situation that does not throw them out but gives them choice in the form of the ability to decide for themselves what steps they will take to see whether it is possible for them to live there or whether they are willing to move? Thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of people in this country move house every year, and they do so because their life circumstances have changed. They do not expect the state to say, &#8220;We won&#8217;t let you move&#8221; or &#8220;We will prevent you from moving.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.388.5/5">That flexibility is useful. It allows people to move to where there is employment. It allows our hon. Friends the nationalists to move to London so that they can represent their constituents in this great, illustrious Parliament. It is the essential part of ensuring that our economy has a free flow of labour around the country so that people can, in the words of Norman Tebbit, move to where the jobs are. If we have an entirely static housing market we will find that we reduce employment opportunities, undermine growth in the economy, and, worst of all, create deep unfairness for people in large families who can find no social housing and put a burden on the backs of the poorest taxpayers. We should be proud of this Government&#8212;proud of a Lib Dem Minister, of all things&#8212;for doing what is right, what is noble and what is just.</p>

	<p pid="b.389.0/1">It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to contribute to what has been a very interesting debate so far. We have heard a number of very powerful speeches from Members concerned about the bedroom tax and they have outlined very fully the implications that it will have for many of the groups who will be adversely affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/2">I represent a constituency that will be strongly affected by this policy, and many of my constituents already know that. They are waiting to see how the local council and the Scottish Government react to what the coalition Government have done. We have about 2,700 tenants who are likely to be affected by the new under-occupancy rules on <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April</phrase>&#8212;over 51% of them are in receipt of</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/3">housing benefit. That is because of the type of accommodation that we have in North Ayrshire. As in many parts of the country, there are very few one-bedroom properties. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations recently commissioned a report that says:</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/4">&#8220;Across all tenants, 62% need one bedroom but only 34% have this.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/5">This point has been made across the political divide. There is a mismatch between the types of accommodation that are available and the people who are looking for those properties. We are therefore facing a crisis on <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April</phrase>. Irrespective of the strength of some of the points that might be made about people possibly living in properties that are too big for them, this mismatch means that on <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April</phrase> people will be looking for one-bedroom and two-bedroom properties that simply are not there, and they will pay the price of this Government&#8217;s moral and economic policies.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/6">It was only in the past few days that this country lost its triple A rating from Moody&#8217;s credit rating agency. The response that we should have seen from the Government is an understanding that we need to invest to get growth. One of the most important things we should do, given this country&#8217;s housing crisis, is to put money into housing, particularly social housing and council houses. The nationalists and the Greens were right to choose this as the topic of today&#8217;s debate, because it affects so many of our constituents, but it is tragic that we are not having a debate about how to get growth in this country and about how to make sure that we invest so that our people have decent living standards.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/7">Council housing was created in the first place to provide decent housing for those who did not have it. The whole ethos of council housing was to build properties that were of a higher standard than those that were available previously to ordinary working people. It was not about whether someone had a spare bedroom, because the idea of a bigger living room or more space was part of what the whole project was about. As I said in my intervention on <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase>, that policy was supported across the political divide before the second world war and immediately after it. It is tragic that we have got ourselves into a position where the social housing needed by ordinary people has not been built in recent decades.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/8">Many people will simply not be in a position to move on <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April</phrase>. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40216" name="Jim McGovern">the Member for Dundee West (Jim McGovern)</phrase> has said, the discretionary funds available to councils are nowhere near big enough to implement the kind of discretion that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> would like to see. The money simply is not there.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/9">People in adapted properties in all of our constituencies will have money deducted from their housing benefit on <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April</phrase>. Foster parents have fluctuating needs, because they take children at short notice. They do not necessarily take one child&#8212;they might take a family&#8212;so they do not know how many bedrooms they will need. The whole idea is that their household is able to take those children.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/10">We know from all the work that has been done that disabled people will be at the forefront of this policy. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">The hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> has already highlighted that 79% of those affected in Scotland will be in a household that contains a disabled person.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/11">The figure for the rest of the UK is 63% and even though the figure is more extreme in Scotland and other parts of the country, this will become a significant problem in Members&#8217; surgeries in all parts of the country. Even wealthier parts include people who face the predicaments that many of us see on a more regular basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/12">The Government&#8217;s policy will have a massive impact up and down the country and on local government in particular. If the policy works as the coalition Government expect it to work, it is estimated that it will take &#163;50 million out of the Scottish economy. That will have implications, because it will be taking money out of the pockets of individuals and communities. We all know that there are communities in which significant numbers of people are reliant on the benefits system, whether they work or not. They work and live in areas with low-wage economies, such as North Ayrshire and Arran, which has a glorious industrial past. In the 1970s, 14,000 people were employed at ICI in Ardeer in my constituency. In the 1980s, 10,000 people were employed at the Killoch pit in south Ayrshire.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/13">It is obvious that our communities have a proud industrial past, but those jobs have gone and well-paid jobs have not come in their place, and some communities are disproportionately reliant on the state. We need to do something about that; we do not want to be in that position. That is the challenge that we all face collectively. I say to the Government that taking money out of those communities and out of the pockets of individuals who live in them will simply grind down those communities even further.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/14">We should be talking about economic and welfare policies that put money back into communities, about investing for growth and about putting job creation at the centre of all our policies. Instead, we are faced with a policy that will end in chaos and cause misery for hundreds of thousands of people up and down the country. I believe that it is a policy that the Ministers sitting on the Front Bench will wish they had never been involved in.</p>

	<p pid="b.391.0/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for calling me to speak in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/2"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> said that the Opposition have many soundbites and that the Government should develop some of their own. Perhaps the Government are not able to develop soundbites because they have nothing good to say about this measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/3">I have listened to the many Members who have contributed to this debate. On the face of it, the Government&#8217;s proposals sound logical. There are apparently 1 million bedrooms going spare in this country. The argument is that people should not be able to carry on living in homes that have too many bedrooms, but should be moved to smaller homes. That sounds sensible and practical, but it does not reflect the reality on the ground. Few homes fall into the category of a two or three-bedroom house that is lived in by a healthy, fit person but is under-occupied. Most of the so-called spare bedrooms are needed by the people who live in those homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/4">I say that not because I am in any party political grouping, but because of what my constituents have said to me in my surgery and in letters. I can honestly say that none of the people who have contacted me fall into the criteria that the Government are presenting. I will share with the Ministers and other Members of the House the experience of the constituents who have spoken to me.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/5">A number of the constituents who have spoken to me are single parents whose children do not live with them for seven days a week, but stay with them for two or three days, depending on the arrangements made by the court. People in that situation who live in a two-bedroom place will be severely affected by these provisions. What will parents who do not have the money to go into private rented accommodation or buy a home with the right number of bedrooms say to their children? They will have to say, &#8220;Sorry, you can&#8217;t come to stay because I have to go to a one-bedroom flat. I will not be able to spend quality time with you. I will not be able to develop a proper relationship with you as other mothers and fathers can with their children.&#8221; That is the kind of situation we are talking about.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">The hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> said that anybody who has a bar outside their home can be described as disabled. The people who have come to me have been elderly or very unwell and have homes that have been adapted substantially at a cost of thousands of pounds. They are often quite small properties, but may have one tiny room that is counted as a spare bedroom and has just enough space to store their wheelchair, commode, Zimmer frame or other equipment that disabled and unwell people often have.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/7">Such people tend to be in social housing. Everybody who knows about social housing knows that they are small homes. That is certainly the case in my constituency. Even if they are two-bedroom flats, they tend to be very small, but people need a bit of space to be able to manoeuvre. What should I say to the constituents who write to me because they are being told that they will have to find somewhere else to live, but do not have &#163;700 or &#163;800 a year to pay for it? What about parents with two children of the same gender? They may have three bedrooms but they will be tiny rooms and the two children&#8212;two girls or two boys&#8212;will be in one little room where they cannot do anything except perhaps sleep on camp beds or bunk beds and they cannot have a proper room. Do we tell such people, &#8220;No, you&#8217;ve got to go; you cannot stay in this house and if you do you must pay &#163;800&#8221;? That is the reality on the ground.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/8">Foster parents have been mentioned but what was said about it being easy for someone to register as a foster carer and get an extra room is just not the case. People must go through high-level checks, training and vetting that can take months or even years before they are assessed as suitable to be a foster carer. To suggest that someone would become a foster carer to avoid moving out of their home or to claim an extra bedroom does not fit reality.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/9">Many Members have touched on particular groups of people, and again I ask the Minister to reconsider this measure. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40356" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> mentioned a number of concerns that need to be addressed but I do not want to repeat points about discretionary issues and other ways that</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/10">the bedroom tax will impact on people. At the moment, this is a compulsory scheme and a matter of law so if people have a spare bedroom, they will end up paying money unless they can argue for discretionary help. As has been said, on <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April</phrase> people will be faced with a choice of what happens and will end up with bills. They will then have to go to their local housing association or council and see whether they fit the criteria required to get some help. If they do not get that help, what will happen?</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/11">What happens when the &#163;30 million set aside for this scheme is gone? Will more money be put into the fund so that people continue to benefit from it? Instead of a statutory scheme, would it not be better to work with councils and housing associations to try first and foremost to work out whether housing need can be reorganised and people placed in the homes that are appropriate for them? At the end of that process there may be some people who wilfully do not want to move, some who live in a massive home or there may be a single person of good mental and physical health living in a two or three-bedroom house and they might not be worried. However, they make up a tiny minority of those who have the so-called 1 million spare bedrooms. The majority of people&#8212;98%&#8212; fall into different categories.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/12">Of course there is a need to address people who are waiting to be housed appropriately in proper homes or in accommodation that fits and meets their need. I have constituents in a similar situation. People suggest this is an unusual idea, but the way to tackle the problem is to consider a home-building programme. It is all very well hon. Members saying that one Government did not do that, another Government sold council houses and another should have done more, but we are where we are now. Instead of looking back at what could have happened five, 10 or 20 years ago, why not deal with our current problem of acute housing shortage? Doing that will not involve subsidised housing because, as everybody knows, the cost of building a house on a piece of land is not as much as the value of the property once it is put up for sale. Bricks and mortar do not cost as much as a house, the value of which can be over-inflated. When groups of people or associations and voluntary bodies get together and start building homes, they can pay for those houses so that the Government or state do not have to subsidise them. We must encourage local authorities and such groups to invest and allow house-building programmes to provide housing and help to regenerate the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.391.0/13">The measure is compulsory, but I urge Ministers to think about encouraging local authorities and housing associations to get together to deal with the people who will be affected. Constituents who are disabled and unwell write to me. One gentleman told me that he has one tiny bedroom, which will be considered spare, but he needs a commode, a Zimmer frame and a wheelchair. He cannot house that equipment in his tiny little&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.393.1/1">I am grateful to be called to speak in this Plaid Cymru, Scottish National party and Green party debate on the UK Government&#8217;s proposals to introduce an</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/2">under-occupation penalty for recipients of housing benefit in the social rented sector. The policy has already gained infamy&#8212;it is dubbed &#8220;the bedroom tax&#8221;. The Labour party has decided to make it a political dividing line with the UK coalition. Leaving aside the fact that Labour Members abstained on Second Reading of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 and have failed to raise the issue in the House in a motion leading to a vote, I was delighted that the shadow Secretary of State for Wales, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40482" name="Owen Smith">the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Owen Smith)</phrase>, confirmed on Twitter this afternoon that Labour Members will join us in the Lobby later.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/3">Before the 2010 general election, I made a keynote speech at the Plaid Cymru spring conference at the home of Welsh cricket, Sophia Gardens in Cardiff&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It was brilliant. In that speech, I said that talking up the severity of the public debt was a deliberate tactic by the Tories that served two political objectives: first, it highlighted the economic mismanagement of the previous Administration; and secondly, it created the backdrop to justify the declaration of war on the public sector, which we have witnessed since the election. The so-called bedroom tax is a prime example of what I foresaw. It is a headline-grabbing, ill-thought-out policy that panders to the prejudices of those opposed to any social protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.393.1/4">We have heard compelling arguments in the debate on why the motion should be carried, most notably from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase>, who opened the debate&#8212;I will not restate her points. Above all, the bedroom tax is part of the UK Government&#8217;s strategy to reduce the housing benefit bill, as the Minister admitted in his opening remarks. The capping of benefits is the major element of the strategy, which is complemented by the under-occupancy policy and the recent Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill, which pegs annual increases at 1%.</p>

	<p pid="b.394.0/1">We sometimes hear Ministers speak of deficit reduction, but is it not likely that the net effects of the policy will be the opposite, because it will reduce demand in the economy by taking money away from the pockets of people who are most likely to spend it, and who certainly need it? The result will be yet more economic mismanagement, which will probably contribute to a further downgrading of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.394.1/1">My hon. Friend makes a valid point&#8212;I will give him some meat to justify it in my next remarks.</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/2">The Office for Budget Responsibility radically revised its projections for housing benefit expenditure in the autumn statement. At the time of last year&#8217;s Budget in March, the OBR projected that the housing benefit bill would fall by &#163;300 million in 2012-13; and then by &#163;400 million for each financial year between 2013-14 and 2016-17. The OBR now projects an increase of &#163;700 million in 2013-14, and increases of &#163;600 million, &#163;500 million and &#163;400 million in subsequent years.</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/3">There is a multitude of reasons for that, but by far, one key factor is the spiralling cost of rent. Housing benefit is an in-work benefit. As rent costs spiral, more and more working people faced with real-terms falls in wages meet the eligibility criteria for housing support. The <i>Financial Times </i>has reported that, in 2012, rent costs increased by an average of 37% compared with</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/4">2007, despite the economy being in the midst of the great recession since 2008&#8212;gross domestic product is still nearly 4% below the previous peak.</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/5">The <i>Financial Times </i>further reported that rent costs are expected to increase by an incredible 35% in the next six years. More and more employed people will become eligible for housing benefit. Indeed, last summer, the housing benefit claimant count surpassed the five million mark for the first time, which means that around 20% of households are claiming the benefit to help them meet their housing costs. Between January 2010 and December 2011, the total number of housing benefit claimants increased by 301,000. In the same period, the number of non-passported claims&#8212;those in employment&#8212;increased by 279,000. Therefore, households in employment account for 92.8% of the overall increase in housing benefit claimants. Unless we are able to ensure that the pace of rent increases broadly reflects incomes, then Governments of whatever colour will have no chance of controlling their housing benefit costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/6">Measures such as the under-occupancy penalty are tinkering around the edges. There are solutions for dealing with the housing benefit bill without resorting to the sort of initiatives preferred by the current UK Government that are having such a detrimental social impact. In 2004, the Government of the Republic of Ireland introduced the Residential Tenancies Act. A private residential tenancy board was set up to deliver reforms. Its aim was to regulate the private rented sector by extending the length of tenancy towards a more European model, clearly defining rights and obligations for both landlords and tenants, providing access to inexpensive dispute resolution, safeguarding bond payments and, crucially, capping rents.</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/7">By placing a cap on rents and driving down artificially high rental costs, the Government would have direct control over their housing benefit bill. The UK Government could then reduce their liabilities without penalising some of the most vulnerable people in society. It would also mean that working people would have a better chance of affording rent costs in affluent areas. Rent caps have been a fixture in New York since the 1940s, and New York is the home of global capitalism. Rather than targeting social housing tenants, the UK Government, and devolved Governments if they have the competence, should intervene in the social and private rented sector and cap rents.</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/8">As we have heard from other hon. Members, another solution is to address supply and demand issues by building more affordable housing. The recovery in the UK after the great depression was in part the result of a massive house building initiative. This is an ideal time for private investment, because of the guaranteed revenue streams from rental payments. It would create construction jobs and drive demand in the economy. As far as this debate is concerned, it would reduce rent costs in the private rented sector and thus the housing benefit bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/9">With specific reference to the under-occupancy penalty, social tenants worried about the technicalities of the new rules have already approached my constituency offices. One of my constituents lives in a two-bedroom bungalow and receives full housing benefit. He has turned one of the bedrooms into a sterile room for his dialysis treatment. He spends three hours a day, seven</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/10">days a week in this room. He has spent a lot of money turning the bedroom into a sterile room and adapting his home for his dialysis treatment. This saves the health board money, as well as releasing the hospital bed for others. Why should he now be penalised for technically under occupying his home?</p>
	<p pid="b.394.1/11">Another constituent contacted me to say they had been moved from a two-bedroom property to a three-bedroom property that had been adapted for their needs. They now face the charge, despite the housing officer saying that the third bedroom is too small to be used as a bedroom. They will not, as was advocated by several Government Members, be able to rent that bedroom to a lodger. The answers to the housing benefit bill do not lie in a cap in benefits, a real-terms reduction in annual uprating or the bedroom tax. I urge Ministers to think again and to look at some of the solutions I have offered today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.396.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40688" speakername="Iain McKenzie" colnum="396"  time="017:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#130227-0003.htm_spnew56">
	<p pid="b.396.0/1">I welcome this debate. Unjust, unfair and unnecessary are the words to describe this tax. Households in my constituency will suffer dramatically as a direct result of the introduction of this tax. Indeed, families throughout Scotland and the United Kingdom will suffer the consequences of this tax. In Scotland, we are told that a total of 94,000 tenants living in the social rented sector are considered to be under-occupying their homes. We are told that a total of 75,000-plus tenants are under-occupying by only one bedroom.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.0/2">With still unacceptable levels of unemployment and soaring energy and fuel prices, this measure brings nothing but further bad news for the struggling households across Scotland and the UK. Specialist bodies, including Citizens Advice and Shelter, have already warned that 40,000 households in Scotland alone are likely to run up arrears, with research suggesting that up to 10,000 households could face homelessness. That is on top of tackling the homeless problem we already have in Scotland. The prospect of homelessness is a reflection of the direction in which the Government are taking the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.0/3">The bedroom tax is neither a cost-cutting exercise by the Government nor about introducing fair reform to the welfare state; it is nothing more than a tax on the poor and the most vulnerable in communities across the country. Of the 94,000-plus Scots who will be affected by the tax, it is estimated that about 23,000 have a disabled household member, with up to 16,000 households already having some form of aid or necessary adaption in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.0/4">Constituents have approached me as they have become aware of how this unfair tax will affect their quality of life. I will give one example, although I could give many others. One lady came to me who previously had shared a home with her daughter. Her daughter has moved on, however, having found employment in another part of the country. The lady has a two-bedroom apartment, but now has one spare room. She has lived in the apartment for more than 20 years. She feels safe there and has good neighbours, but is now scared she will have to move and feels unsettled and frightened at the prospect of being moved across the constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.0/5">My constituent asked me, &#8220;Where can I go?&#8221; Down-sizing is not an option for her, because in my constituency there is not much one-bedroom accommodation. It is</p>
	<p pid="b.396.0/6">so limited, in fact, that she would be in her 80s before she would be offered one-bedroom accommodation, if she was lucky. Indeed, there is a lack of family accommodation in my constituency, too, so we really need to address the lack of housing and the building of new housing in and around Inverclyde. She wonders, if she were to move to the private sector, whether she would end up in a house of multiple occupancy, where we see that the private sector&#8217;s reference to efficiency involves merely pushing people into rooms with shared facilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.396.0/7">By introducing this tax, the Government will do nothing more than cement their unfair and unjust attack on those who need our help the most. I support today&#8217;s motion, which calls on them to abandon this unfair, unjust and unnecessary tax, and I add my voice to the list of many here and beyond this place calling on the Government urgently to change course before these reforms hit our constituents hard. I also call on the Scottish Government to act to alleviate the burden of the tax on the people of Scotland. Across Scotland, local authorities already suffering as a direct result of severe cuts to their budgets will find it impossible to minimise the impact of the bedroom tax on many of our constituents and communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.397.0/1">Is not one of the most important things that local councils could do perhaps to reclassify bedrooms that could be used for other purposes and are no longer bedrooms?</p>

	<p pid="b.397.1/1">That is an option, but as I have said, the difficulty in my constituency is that we have limited accommodation, and the reclassification of bedrooms is not an option there.</p>
	<p pid="b.397.1/2">I have been working with many agencies in my constituency that have been offering advice to those who think they will be affected by the tax. We have been holding events and information evenings, and people are frightened that they will fall foul of this tax and lose their homes. The Scottish Government could provide more guidance and help to local authorities about how to cope with the impact we know is coming. The bedroom tax is not a Westminster attack on Scotland alone. As we have heard, it is an attack on many constituencies across the UK, and I join others in calling on the Government to abandon this unjust, unfair and very unnecessary tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.397.2/1">I had to leave the Chamber earlier to help to launch a document on the links between speech, language and communication needs and social disadvantage. I mention that because one of the document&#8217;s key findings is relevant to the debate. When children in the top 25% of cognitive ability from working class backgrounds are tested at the age of 22 months and compared with children in the bottom 25% of cognitive ability from upper middle class backgrounds, we see that the upper middle class children will have overtaken the working class children by the age of 10. That is a result of speech, language and communication issues. I suggest that the dislocation of working class families and communities that these housing benefit changes will cause, through the eviction of parents because their children have grown up, is</p>
	<p pid="b.397.2/2">another example of the targeting of working class people who could do so much better in life and add so much more in terms of tax revenues and so on. They are the ones who will be hit the hardest.</p>

	<p pid="b.398.1/1">That is certainly the case. It is disappointing and illuminating that the Government Benches are almost empty this afternoon. Government Members simply do not care about a group of people who they believe will not vote. They see them as people who have failed in life and who will not vote&#8212;only 65% to 70% of people vote&#8212;so they think that they can treat them like cattle, and that is what they are doing.</p>

	<p pid="b.398.2/1">Is it not also indicative of the tone of the debate that the people who are encouraged to take in lodgers are usually those on lower incomes? There is no great push by the Government to ask the middle classes, the upper middle classes or indeed the upper classes to take lodgers into their mansions, palaces or castles. This move is aimed at the bottom end of society, and it is shameful.</p>

	<p pid="b.398.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/2">The Government falsely claim that the problem is under-occupancy in the social sector. They say that that is awful, and a terrible waste. I have asked the House of Commons Library for the figures on under-occupancy rates. According to the bedroom standard, the level of under-occupancy in the social rented sector is 10.2%. In the private rented sector, it is 15.7%, and in the owner-occupied sector, it is 49%. So it is all very well for those who own their houses, who have five times the amount of under-occupancy, but people who are poor and who are in the social rented sector because the market has let them down are not allowed to have an empty room. Why should not those people be allowed an empty room? We have heard about people with disabilities and people with chronic problems, but what about normal people who just want their friends or their children to come and visit them? And who would want a one-bedroom house?</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/3">Let us look at the evolution of social housing. I was the chair of housing for the biggest local authority in London&#8212;Croydon&#8212;and chair of housing for the association representing all the boroughs across London. How does social housing work? We build two-bedroom and three-bedroom houses for families in need, who live in them with their children. Their children grow up and perhaps go to university or get married, and we end up with the couple in an under-occupied house. What happens then? They die, and we recycle those houses. It is no surprise that under-occupancy in the social sector is so low, because the sector naturally refreshes itself. Those people do not live for ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/4">In Croydon, we also set up incentives involving thousands of pounds. We said to people, &#8220;Look, you&#8217;re an old lady living in a three-bedroom house. We&#8217;ll give you a few thousand pounds if you&#8217;ll go and live in a two-bedroom</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/5">house. You&#8217;ll still have room for the grandchildren to come and stay, but times are tough.&#8221; And they did&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/6" class="italic">[</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/7" class="italic">Interruption.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/8" class="italic">]</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/9">It is all very well the Minister saying from a sedentary position that it did not work. He has not tried that scheme. Why, instead of piloting his stupid ideas, does he not put the two models side by side and see which one works?</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/10">Instead of looking only at the savings and benefits involved, why does the Minister not also look at the costs? He should look at the costs in terms of community breakdown and family breakdown. What will his proposals do for people&#8217;s ability to get a job, for example? The Government want people to get some training, get a job and get some stability. Well, that is absolutely ridiculous. The social, economic and practical impacts of the measures are completely unthought out. The reason is that the Government do not care, and they do not care because they think that those people do not vote. Why is it that people over 60 are excluded from the list? It is because they vote. What does that say? It says, &#8220;Don&#8217;t have any children until you&#8217;re 40, because if you have them and they grow up and have to leave home, you will hit 60 at that time and you&#8217;ll be all right.&#8221; That is great, isn&#8217;t it? It is completely cynical and it stinks.</p>
	<p pid="b.398.3/11">What does this mean for the practical implications of managing the housing revenue account? It is claimed that all this money will be saved, but some of it allegedly saved for the Government is lost by local authorities. As I said earlier, I have run a housing revenue account, so I know what will happen. A number of people will stop paying all their rent by the margin that is being cut. If I am in the local authority with a portfolio of two or three-bedroom houses, but with hardly any one-bedroom ones, I will say to the people that are not paying all their rent, &#8220;We will evict you, but we do not have any one-bedroom houses&#8221;. They will go to the private rented sector where the rents are higher and are escalated by the pressure on the market, and that will cost me more as a manager. What is more, as more people join the private rented sector, others in that sector will pay higher rents, so it will be difficult for people to build up a deposit and buy a house. That is great as well, isn&#8217;t it? It is absolutely hopeless.</p>

	<p pid="b.399.1/1">Yes, and why should someone who has lived in the same street, whose children have grown up with their neighbours and who knows everybody&#8212;having been to the local schools, visited the local pubs and worked in the locality&#8212;be dislocated and thrown into another community, another town or even another nation? The answer is that these people do not count because they are poor and they live in social housing&#8212;and the Tories and the Liberals are going to sort these people out. It is disgusting.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.1/2">What else is going to happen? If managers or directors of housing have less rent money available, there will be</p>
	<p pid="b.399.1/3">a cut in repairs, leading to more damp and more health problems associated with bad housing. What else can local authorities do? People in Swansea are thinking about knocking down walls. If they have a two-bedroom flat, they can knock a wall down and create a larger living room in order to get round the problem. What does that remind us of? Yes, of course, it reminds us of the window tax. Do we remember when some stupid Tory introduced a tax on windows&#8212;and then people blocked off their windows: what a surprise! We are going to see that sort of thing again. It is absolutely ridiculous and farcical. If it were not so sad, we would all be laughing.</p>
	<p pid="b.399.1/4">Private rents will go up for the mates of the Tories in buy-to-let who will see their incomes grow. It will stop other people buying houses, and we will see empty public sector houses side by side with overcrowded private sector houses. Where there are empty houses, it is costing us much more in lost rent than the shortfall that is being cut in this tax.</p>

	<p pid="b.400.1/2">We will see major problems. My hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State for Wales mentioned the impact of this change on Wales. He said that 46% of households would be affected in Wales as against 31% in England&#8212;half as much again. Once again, this is part of the strategy of taking money out of the poorest communities, yet poor people spend more of their money. If we want a growth strategy to get people back into work, we should give money to poor people instead of giving it to the rich who hide it away in savings accounts or offshore accounts. When people have only a little money, they have no choice but to spend it. We are denuding local authorities with poor populations of money power.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.1/3">What of incentives? A son or daughter of parents might say, &#8220;I want to go off and get married and live with this person. I want to go off and live in a different town and get a different job. I haven&#8217;t got a job here; I&#8217;m unemployed.&#8221; The parent would say, &#8220;Son, that will cost me&#8221;. What if the children want to go off to university? That is going to cost the parents, too. Once again, this is just encouraging people to stay where they are until somebody hits 60. It is preposterous. The savings will not be made.</p>

	<p pid="b.400.3/1">My point is that if someone goes away to work, that person will lose the bedroom. Moreover, if someone&#8217;s children go off to university, they will not be hanging around in the local chip shop&#8212;which is good, but obviously their parents will say, &#8220;We do not want an educated son and daughter going off and leaving us to pay for the empty bedroom. You can stay here and run the chip shop. That was good enough for us.&#8221; That is the sort of new economy that the Minister&#8212;who is now dozing off&#8212;wants, and it just does not make any sense.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.3/2">As for the overall savings, the Government are making political choices. They will not save &#163;490 million, because much of that will consist of costs for local authorities. What they are saying is &#8220;We will give the money to the voting people. We will increase their tax thresholds. Let&#8217;s face it, they are not going to work any harder. We will not harm the older people, because they vote; we will harm the poor people who do not vote. Let us hope that they do not. If they do not register to vote, we have our other plan to carve up the constituencies, so that their size relates not to the population but the number of people who are registered.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.401.0/1">I know that many other Members wish to speak, so I shall try to keep well within the 10-minute limit.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.0/2">I am particularly concerned about the way in which this measure will affect foster carers. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40356" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> made a powerful case for why it makes much more sense for them to be exempted from it. When I have raised the issue with the Minister at Question Time, he has said that they will be all right because there is a discretionary fund, but I think it much more sensible for them to be exempted.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.0/3">It is clear to me from conversations with more than one set of foster parents in my constituency that there is a lack of communication about discretionary payments, and that people find out about them only by dint of good luck and interventions of other kinds. I am well aware that the constituents who come to me may be just scratching the surface, and that there are likely to be many others in a similar position who do not visit their Members of Parliament. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40064" name="Jane Ellison">The hon. Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison)</phrase> seemed to suggest that we should not raise the cases that are brought to us, but I think that they are the tip of the iceberg rather than the exceptions that she sought to suggest.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.0/4">One of my constituents has been a foster carer for more than 30 years. During that time she has fostered more than 50 children, sometimes on long-term placements&#8212;a couple who are with her at present have been there for a number of years&#8212;but sometimes on shorter placements. Sometimes there is a gap. She was recently told by her housing association&#8212;her social landlord&#8212;that she had three spare rooms. She does not. She has three bedrooms in her property, which are used to provide care for children who would probably cost the taxpayer even more otherwise, and would probably be receiving a less constant form of social care. She is providing that care because it is something that society wants and values. Only this week my local authority, South Lanarkshire council, sought to encourage more people to foster, but at the same time constituents of mine are telling me how concerned they are about the impact of this measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.0/5">As for discretionary payments, the clue is in the name: they are discretionary. That means that they may or may not be applied. That means that there is a limit to the money, and once it has gone, it has gone. That means that it is added to a bigger fund to deal with a whole range of different circumstances, and there is no</p>
	<p pid="b.401.0/6">guarantee that it will be sufficient. My constituent lives almost on the border of two local authority areas; she fosters for one local authority and lives in another. She is fortunate in that she contacted me and I was able to join things up, but we do not know that that will happen in many cases. All those points make the case for foster parents and foster carers to be exempt, rather than being caught in the &#8220;discretionary&#8221; category.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">The hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase>, who is no longer in the Chamber, makes some cogent points from time to time, but it was ridiculous of him to suggest this afternoon that people would seek to apply to become foster carers just to avoid this. That is a ridiculous assertion, and it is insulting to those who put time and effort into being foster carers, for the wider good of society. On this specific point, the Government need to think again. The hon. Member for Leeds North West put that to the Minister, and they are both from the same party. I say that, too, as a Member of a different party. If the Government are to pursue this policy, this specific point must be addressed, because it is not fair and it is not equitable, and it has all sorts of potential unintended consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> hinted at some of the potential shortcomings and explained the problems. It is not sensible to continue with badly thought-through policies that have adverse consequences. The Government have an opportunity to think again on this, and to try to get it right. I understand the points being made about occupancy and pressure on housing, but that is not an excuse to bring in a measure that is severely punitive.</p>
	<p pid="b.401.0/9">A pair of foster parents in my constituency have said that if they were starting out again they would think again about whether to foster. They have been fostering for more than 20 years, providing dozens of children with a higher standard of care and a more stable position in society. If such people are to be put off because of this imposition, and because they will be caught up in a payment that is discretionary, that will send a poor signal to society in general. I implore the Minister to think again on this specific point, as well as on the tax as a whole.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.402.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" speakername="Helen Goodman" colnum="402"  time="017:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#130227-0003.htm_spnew71">
	<p pid="b.402.0/1">I was so shocked when I read what my constituents wrote to me about the implications for them of the bedroom tax, and about how little they would have left to live on, that I decided during the week of the recent recess to see if I could survive on &#163;18 a week, which is what they will be left with to buy their food after <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April</phrase>. That figure of &#163;18 is entirely based on the experiences of my constituents, in particular women on employment and support allowance who are about the same age as me, but who had to stop working owing to chronic health conditions, perhaps after 20 years of working life. Out of their &#163;71.70, they have to find &#163;10 for electricity, &#163;20 for heating&#8212;gas or coal&#8212;&#163;6 for water rates, &#163;4 for bus fares in the case of those who live in villages and have to get to the main town, and &#163;10 for the bedroom tax, which left them with &#163;23 for weekly living expenses.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/2">That &#163;23 has to cover more than food, of course. We did a calculation, and set aside &#163;5 for all the non-food things everyone has to buy&#8212;soap, washing powder, washing-up liquid, toothpaste, loo paper&#8212;plus</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/3">a small amount in order to save &#163;50 a year for clothes or a pair of trainers, or in case the iron breaks. That leaves &#163;18.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/4">I therefore took up the challenge of trying to live on &#163;18, and I want to tell Members what it is like. It is extremely unpleasant. I had porridge for breakfast every morning, as I usually do, but I make my porridge with milk; now I was making it with water. I had to eat the same food over and over and over again. Single people are hit particularly hard, because cheap food comes in big packs. I made a stew at the beginning of the week, and I ate the same food four nights a week. I had pasta twice a week. I had baked potatoes. I had eggs on six occasions. It was completely impossible to have meat or fish; that was out of the question. It was also impossible to have five portions of fruit and vegetables a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/5">I therefore also have a message for the Under-Secretary of State for Health, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40130" name="Anna Soubry">the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry)</phrase>, who is responsible for public health. She was criticising people on low incomes for obesity. Of course people on low incomes are more likely to have that problem; they have to fill up on toast and biscuits.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/6">I found myself waking up in the middle of the night absolutely ravenous, having to make cups of tea and eat biscuits. I had a headache for five days in that week, and I was completely lethargic and exhausted by 4 pm. Some people are on jobseeker&#8217;s allowance and are looking for a job. Looking for a job is a job in itself; it takes time and energy. The people whom DWP Ministers want to do workfare are being expected to work 30 hours a week, yet they are not going to have enough to eat properly.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/7">Most shocking of all was the fact that come Sunday I ran out of food&#8212;there was literally nothing left to eat that night. If Ministers are happy with the notion that 660,000 of our fellow citizens are literally not going to have enough to eat by the end of the week, all I can say is that I pity them because they have no pity and no conception of what they are going to do to the people in our constituencies who will be faced with this bedroom tax.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/8">The Minister has been very free and easy in talking about all these wonderful alternatives, such as the fact that people can move. In my constituency more than 1,000 people will be affected by the bedroom tax, but there are fewer than 100 smaller properties to which they could move. In my constituency, it is not possible for all these people to increase the number of hours they work, as seven people are chasing every job; people are in part-time work because they cannot get full-time work. Government Members have shown their complete ignorance of the benefits system by saying, &#8220;You just have to work a couple of hours a week on the minimum wage.&#8221; Of course that is not true, because these people would get then into the tapers and the disregards, and their benefits would be cut or they might find themselves paying tax. The numbers simply do not add up.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/9">Of course some individuals or couples have properties that are larger than they need, but the so-called under-occupancy is in one part of the country and the overcrowding is in another. It simply is not credible to suggest that all the large, over-occupying families in London will move up to Durham, particularly given</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/10">that the unemployment rate there is more than 9%. What would they be moving to? What would they be moving for?</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/11">I made a video diary of my week, so I got a lot of feedback from people affected by this policy. Interestingly, they said, &#8220;Yes, this is the reality of our lives. We are not able to survive properly now and things are going to get worse to the tune of &#163;10 a week from <phrase class="date" code="2013-04-01">1 April</phrase>.&#8221; In 2006, I did the same experiment under the previous Labour Government, living on benefits to see what life was like for young people on the lowest rate of income support. I found that difficult, but there was enough money to get through the whole week. I wish to point out to the Minister that we have reached a new low, because the &#163;21 that people had in 2006 is equivalent to &#163;28 now, and that should be compared with the &#163;18 with which people are going to be expected to feed themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/12">The Minister has made much, too, of the discretionary housing benefits, which many hon. Members have questioned. In County Durham, &#163;5 million of income will be taken out of people&#8217;s pockets and out of the local economy. The size of the discretionary fund is half a million pounds, so once again there is a huge gap between actual need and the resources being given to people to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.0/13">Many hon. Members have pointed out the unfairness of the policy for people who are disabled and need to sleep separately, be they adults or children; people who have children in the Army; foster carers; and separated parents. This policy is a fundamental attack on the poorest people in this country. People are going to lose between &#163;500 and &#163;1,000 over the course of next year, through no fault of their own. But the really disgusting thing is that on the same day that the bedroom tax is being introduced millionaires are being given a tax cut that will be worth &#163;1,000&#8212;not over the year as a whole, but every single week.</p>

	<p pid="b.404.0/1">I want to address first the comparisons between the private and the social rented sector. As was said earlier, we are comparing apples and pears. The private rented sector is not where the majority of people intend to spend their lives. Research has shown over and over again that people see it as a transitional part of their life&#8212;they use it when they are younger and they hope to move on. It is true that in the past few years it has become more difficult for people to move on&#8212;it is difficult to get a mortgage and move into the owner-occupied sector, and there is a shortage of social rented housing. Nevertheless, people do not see the private rented sector as a long-term home.</p>
	<p pid="b.404.0/2">The social rented sector provides long-term, low-rent homes. The people who live in them might have been out of work at some point in their lives, but they are often in low-paid work and want to be able to afford to do that work. The people who will be affected will often have lived in those houses for many years. Some have compared this situation with the introduction of the local housing allowance, but that was not introduced retrospectively, which is what is happening here&#8212;that was made clear in an intervention earlier.</p>
	<p pid="b.404.0/3">When people live in a council house or housing association house for many years, they put in a lot, using their DIY skills, or decorating the home and</p>
	<p pid="b.404.0/4">making it how they want it. They have invested in that home, so to tell them that they must pay up or leave entirely ignores the investment that they have made.</p>

	<p pid="b.405.0/1">My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. I had a visit from a constituent whose daughter is disabled, has just obtained local employment and really needs routine. As my hon. Friend has said, they have made great investments in their home. They have a tiny box room that nobody could fit in, but they have been told to have a lodger&#8212;having a lodger in a home with a disabled daughter would, of course, have great risks. Does my hon. Friend agree that displacing such families is totally unfair and affects the development of those children?</p>

	<p pid="b.405.1/1">That is a good example. We are talking about real people, not just apparently unused and unloved bedrooms&#8212;despite the fact that the latter appears to be the view of many people on the Government Benches. Real people will experience real harm, but I suspect that that is part of a wider view of social housing and is not entirely accidental.</p>

	<p pid="b.405.2/1">On the question of people having spare bedrooms and houses that are too big for them, will my hon. Friend also bear in mind the fact that on occasion local authorities trying to let houses in hard-to-let areas have encouraged people to take houses that are slightly bigger than their immediate need would suggest in order to ensure that they are not left empty? Is that not the kind of approach that would be undermined if the policy was to go ahead?</p>

	<p pid="b.405.3/1">I know that that has been the case in many areas. My hon. Friend comes from Edinburgh, as I do, and he will know that the problem is not always about hard-to-let areas. As far back as the 1980s, single people in Edinburgh have been housed in two-bedroom houses in some circumstances. That is partly to do with the nature of the stock, as there are not enough one-bedroom houses to match the number of people, and it also acknowledges the fact that people&#8217;s lives are not static.</p>
	<p pid="b.405.3/2">We have heard a lot from the Government about dynamic benefits, but people&#8217;s lives are pretty dynamic and they change. The single person housed in a two-bedroom house might well have a child. If we insist that they can never be in a two-bedroom house, they might have to move later. The same happens in reverse, as people&#8217;s families do not stay static. Even grown-up children, as many of us know, do not necessarily simply go and stay gone. They take a job and move away, but the job or relationship might not work out and they come back. Families also want to visit. Part of this change is about saying to the not very well-off, &#8220;You cannot have the normal elements of family life; we are not going to let you.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.405.3/3">I was about to make a point on the general view of social housing. I think perhaps this policy is part of a pattern, because we have heard from UK Housing Ministers&#8212;those dealing with England&#8212;that they do not want social housing to be permanent housing; they want to introduce short-term tenancies of various types so that people can be moved on. This policy may not be as much of an aberration as some of my colleagues think.</p>

	<p pid="b.406.1/1">I think we can see a large element of that in this policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.406.1/2">As many hon. Members have said, if people move to the private rented sector, the housing benefit bill may actually increase. In Edinburgh, the local housing allowance, which is not especially generous, is &#163;114 for a one-bedroom house. Some of my constituents have asked me about moving into the private rented sector. If they move from their two-bedroom council house, for which the rent is &#163;91 a week, into a private rented property, it will cost more. Rather than a saving, there will be an increase in spending.</p>
	<p pid="b.406.1/3">The vision set out by the Government is of a lot of single people rattling around in big houses with three or four bedrooms. We are asked, &#8220;Doesn&#8217;t that seem unfair? Why shouldn&#8217;t they move on?&#8221; In fact, the vast majority of my constituents affected by this tax are not living in especially big houses. It is suggested that people take in a lodger. I visited a constituent&#8212;a woman in her 50s who is on ESA, although she has always worked previously. Her home has two bedrooms, although the second is pretty small, and the kitchen is off the living room. Having a lodger is not just about having someone in the spare bedroom; it involves sharing all those quite small facilities with somebody else. While my constituent is sitting in the living room, perhaps enjoying watching television or whatever she enjoys doing in the evening, the lodger will come through the room, go into the kitchen, make a cup a tea and come out again. Hon. Members have to understand the kind of houses people actually live in.</p>
	<p pid="b.406.1/4">Local councils in particular are making real efforts to mitigate the impact, but there is a downside to that, because this is another example of where savings in general public spending will not be achieved. How is money saved if, as my council will do, local authorities find additional funding to put into their DHP fund because they believe that that is the humane and common-sense thing to do, given all the disruption that various categories of people might otherwise suffer? That is additional public spending, so we will be saving with one hand and spending with the other. Crucially, the saving that central Government want to make will result in councils having to pick up the pieces.</p>

	<p pid="b.406.2/1">Many Members here who do not represent Scottish constituencies will not realise that the rate capping process carried out by the Scottish National party in government has left local government strapped, with 85% of the cuts last year being to local government budgets, so there will be less money available for the very funding my hon. Friend is talking about.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.406.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" speakername="Sheila Gilmore" colnum="406"  time="017:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#130227-0003.htm_spnew80">
	<p pid="b.406.3/1">That is an important point. The council tax freeze which has been going on for nearly six years now&#8212;people in England will share the joys as well&#8212;has resulted in local councils being unable to go to their populations and say that they would like to put</p>
	<p pid="b.406.3/2">up council tax, so that they can perhaps borrow money to build more council houses. Of course, the people who do not benefit in any way from the council tax freeze are those on the lowest incomes, who do not pay council tax directly because they receive council tax benefit, but they are the very people who will be affected by the bedroom tax. For the lowest earners, the council tax freeze is not a blessing; it has reduced the services they received and hamstrung a lot of councils. I hope the Scottish Government will look again at the policy, which might appear populist but does not benefit the lowest paid.</p>

	<p pid="b.407.1/1">I am not going to give way, because I have done so several times already.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.1/2">If councils are going to put their money into this policy, by increasing discretionary housing payments, or trying to acquire or build more houses, they must be given support. In Scotland, as in England, sadly, we are seeing a substantial reduction in the building of affordable homes. In Scotland, the number of such homes was boosted briefly, but it has gone down from 7,900 two years ago to only 3,400 this year. Some of those homes are for mid market rent, which has its role but is expensive, so it could lead to higher housing benefit payments. The outcome of more mid market rent housing is similar to what is happening in England. We have heard people on the Government Benches saying that the Government will ensure that more affordable houses are built, but I thought they had made it clear that those so-called affordable houses were going to be at up to 80% of market rent, which is expensive. In Edinburgh, a council one-bedroom property is &#163;275 per month, but a mid market one-bedroom property is currently being advertised at &#163;439 per month. Mid market is no substitute for low-cost affordable housing.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.1/3">The high housing benefit bill will be reduced not by measures such as the bedroom tax, but by measures that address the supply of housing and the huge cost of the private rented sector. A couple came to see me who, after six years, had got the two-bedroom wheelchair-accessible house that they need. It is no use saying to them, &#8220;You can apply for a discretionary housing payment.&#8221; In a Westminster Hall debate recently, the Minister said that discretionary housing payments might have to become permanent in such cases, but that couple will still have to apply every year, and will have uncertainty, and that is not fair to them. If such payments have to be permanent, where is the saving? Why not have an exemption?</p>

	<p pid="b.407.2/1">I was pleased to spend last week&#8217;s recess talking about this issue with my constituents, because what we decide in the House has its most crucial impact in the communities we represent. The bedroom tax has achieved in a shorter period the ignominy once reserved in Scottish society only for the hated poll tax. In my constituency, hundreds of people, from Dennistoun to Springburn, continue to sign petitions to stop the measure, which will cost people up to 14% of their weekly housing allowance.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.2/2">Last week, at an event hosted by NG Homes, I met voluntary groups and housing associations from across Glasgow who warned of the effects of the plans on homelessness, rising levels of evictions and rising debt in north and east Glasgow. The Prime Minister&#8217;s ambition is being realised at last&#8212;the big society is coming together, not in his support but in complete opposition to the absurdity and unfairness of the housing benefit plans and the chaos and social harm they will cause. In my constituency, nearly 86% of the 16,580 housing benefit recipients are in properties rented from registered social landlords, and 65% are within the age range that is subject to the bedroom tax. The vast majority receive between &#163;25 and &#163;100 a week in local housing allowance to help with rental costs. That is in a constituency where the median wage is under &#163;17,600 a year, and child poverty is the third highest in the UK and the worst in Scotland, at some 43%.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.2/3">The three areas that will be hurt hardest in Glasgow North East, according to the Glasgow Housing Association, are Milton&#8212;with a higher than average number of lone parents, rent payments there will go up by a collective &#163;8,000 a week&#8212;Keppochill and Possilpark, but last week I discovered people right across my constituency who will be hit by this cruel tax. Around half the recipients in my constituency are on out-of-work benefits, but three in 10 of those who are in employment earn less than the living wage. It is clear that the decline in real wages&#8212;it has accelerated under this Government&#8212;which have fallen every month the Government have been in office, has driven the greater reliance on housing benefit to maintain even these basic living standards.</p>

	<p pid="b.408.3/1">In a nutshell, the cost of reducing the tax threshold by &#163;1,000, which gives taxpayers &#163;6 a week, is &#163;5 billion, 10 times what is being saved here. If someone who is very poor looses &#163;7.50 a week through the empty bedroom tax, someone else is being given &#163;6. Does that not illuminate the Government&#8217;s priorities: hitting the poor and letting the middle class off?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.408.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40274" speakername="William Bain" colnum="408"  time="017:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0003.htm#130227-0003.htm_spnew88">
	<p pid="b.408.4/1">My hon. Friend is certainly right to draw attention to the absurdity of the Chancellor&#8217;s claim that there is a zero tax band for people on low incomes, who of course pay national insurance, higher VAT under this Government and all the things described in this debate. I should also point out that rents are rising in much of Scotland&#8212;by 6.3% in Aberdeen and 5.1% in Edinburgh, for example&#8212;which is adding to the pressure this policy will cause.</p>
	<p pid="b.408.4/2">The bedroom tax will hurt the country in many ways that the Government do not presently acknowledge, for example through its impact on families, the economy, employment and housing. First, these plans utterly fail the test of promoting economic growth. Indeed, by diminishing demand among people who will spend the money, the least well-off, they will have a deeply contractionary effect. Keynes&#8217;s paradox of thrift will</p>
	<p pid="b.408.4/3">sadly become a death knell for local shops across the country as people are forced to cut back on spending. The University of Strathclyde&#8217;s Fraser of Allander Institute estimates the cost to the Scottish economy to be more than 300 jobs, &#163;30 million a year in lost demand and a reduction in wages in Scotland of nearly &#163;8 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.408.4/4">The Minister claims that people should work longer hours, but do I really have to point out to him that under-employment has soared to 3.2 million under this Government and that there is a slump in productivity because demand has been so weakened by their catastrophic fiscal policies? I also remind him that, with the deficit tracking 7% higher this year than last and our credit rating having been downgraded, these are Tory cuts that he is defending because of the Chancellor&#8217;s utter and abject failure on growth.</p>
	<p pid="b.408.4/5">The Office for Budget Responsibility predicted in November 2011 that the economy would grow last year by 2.5%. It has been confirmed today that instead, it grew at less than a tenth of that rate. The impact assessment on these changes also reveals the truth: if people are able to change their behaviour, as the Minister vainly hopes they will, these plans will save little or no money for the Exchequer. His other policies to cut the benefits bill are failing, because unemployment is 340,000 higher than the OBR predicted in 2010 and living standards are falling in a low-growth economy. He can generate the savings he is seeking with this policy only if people cannot move or work longer hours and so are forced to pay the tax. He is making the poorest suffer for the Chancellor&#8217;s manifest incompetence in securing less than a tenth of the economic growth we were predicted to have over the past two and a half years.</p>
	<p pid="b.408.4/6">Secondly, these proposals are a byword for absurdity. The Minister believes that people can simply uproot themselves from homes they have lived in for three decades or more, and from friends, family and jobs, to go and live in parts of the country where there are smaller houses and perhaps fewer opportunities to work. He says that alternatively, people should take in a lodger&#8212;a step that is actively discouraged in the registered social housing sector in Scotland, where stock is allocated on the basis of need. The sheer absurdity is further heightened by his refusal to admit until this afternoon that his plans will potentially remove money from up to 96,000 members of the armed forces, nearly 8,000 Army trainees, carers and foster parents in Glasgow, while nearly 1,000 prisoners on remand in Barlinnie jail in my constituency will be exempt.</p>

	<p pid="b.409.1/1">No, because I am compliant with Mr Speaker&#8217;s strictures on those who wish to take part in the debate. The Minister will have an opportunity to deal with this later.</p>
	<p pid="b.409.1/2">All age groups in society will be affected. People over the age of 61 could be drawn into this tax too if they have a spouse or a partner living with them who is under that age and they apply for universal credit after October.</p>
	<p pid="b.409.1/3">Thirdly, these plans hit the most vulnerable the hardest. Two thirds of the 660,000 people affected across the UK have a disability. Last week I met disabled people who told me that they will be caught by the tax and asked to pay an extra &#163;14 a week for having a room in</p>
	<p pid="b.409.1/4">which no one sleeps but that is used to provide physiotherapy and medical treatment within their home. I spoke to the friends of a young person with a learning disability who is co-operating with the local housing association and who would move into a small house if he could, but there are simply none available. Through no fault of his own, he will be forced to pay the bedroom tax on income support of &#163;47 a week.</p>
	<p pid="b.409.1/5">Fourthly, there is a lack of available properties for people to move into. Some 540,000, or 81%, of those losing out will be people who cannot move because there are no one-bedroom properties in their areas. According to Glasgow Housing Association, there is a waiting list of 13,000 in Glasgow for one-bedroom properties because housing associations, and the council before them, responded to local housing demand by building homes with two or more bedrooms. With a social housing shortfall of 156,000 properties for Scotland&#8217;s housing needs, there is no way the required properties could be built so that people can avoid destitution through having to pay this tax from April.</p>
	<p pid="b.409.1/6">Fifthly, these plans will cause enormous uncertainty for our housing associations. They now have no clarity about their future revenue levels or the investment decisions they can make on social housing. They are unsure whether they should be building one-bedroom houses. They are fearful of managing a surge in rent arrears, with the cost being paid by all tenants in the form of lower priorities for refurbishment of existing properties or reduced budgets for repairs.</p>
	<p pid="b.409.1/7">The wider issue is this Government&#8217;s lack of empathy with those who live in social housing. This is a further attack on that very concept from a Government who have cut the social housing budget in half. This is not an issue that divides people in Scotland from those in England and in Wales: it is about a feeling that Ministers are losing their sense of what is morally right or wrong for people across the United Kingdom. What best sums up what ordinary people feel about the injustice of this absurd tax is a conversation that I had with a 69-year-old constituent on the way to my constituency office last week, who stopped me to see whether she would be affected by the bedroom tax. When I explained that she would not, she told me how troubled she was that other people in her community would have to pay it. She said that this has been the worst Government in her lifetime and that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40599" name="George Osborne">the right hon. Member for Tatton (Mr Osborne)</phrase> is the most arrogant and out-of-touch Chancellor in history, but that of all the cruel things they have done, this is by far the most vicious. She was right.</p>
	<p pid="b.409.1/8">The voice of ordinary people has been heard in this debate, but it must also be reflected in the votes in the Division Lobbies tonight. I particularly urge the party of Lloyd George and Gladstone not to vote for a policy that even the party of Thatcher would have shrunk from in the 1980s. It is the duty of all Members to avoid causing unnecessary suffering to nearly 700,000 people by opposing this cruel tax in a strong, clear vote tonight.</p>

	<p pid="b.411.0/1">I apologise to the House for leaving the Chamber earlier. I had a meeting with a local firefighter who had travelled 300 miles to see me.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/2">According to the four main registered social landlords in my constituency, the bedroom tax will affect 1,770 tenants in my area. That is not an insignificant number and the landlords are working hard with each and every one of them. There is no doubt that some tenants will decide to try to squeeze money out of their budget in order to avoid moving, if moving is an option for them in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/3">We have already heard&#8212;I do not want to go over a lot of the same ground&#8212;that this is about some of our most vulnerable people, including the disabled, students and the military. The last thing that those who serve our country in theatre want to see when they return to their barracks and spend time at what they call home is their family, particularly their parents, being punished in any way.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/4">We have also heard about foster carers. Things are not easy for emergency foster carers, who sometimes have to take in more than one child. If there has been a family breakdown, two or three children might have to be taken into emergency foster care. Kinship carers are also common in my part of the country. Mothers and fathers or aunts and uncles sometimes take in children in an emergency, because of the parents&#8217; chaotic lifestyle.</p>

Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> asked whether assistance will be provided if someone manages to downsize. Will the Minister explain clearly what that assistance will be? Will it merely be discretionary support? It is important that we understand what it will be.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/6">As has been said, people will lose, on average, &#163;14 a week. What will it mean to take in a lodger in such circumstances? Yes, people will be able to make up that shortfall, but if the lodger pays &#163;50 or &#163;60 a week for board and lodgings, that could throw the benefits system into turmoil for many claimants, because there might be a reassessment of benefits. Will the Minister provide clarification on that?</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/7">I thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40577" name="Anne McGuire">the Member for Stirling (Mrs McGuire)</phrase> for encouraging me to hold a welfare reform meeting in my constituency last week. I held it in the town of Dumfries and will hold a similar event in Stranraer, at the other end of my constituency, next week. We brought together charities, churches, registered social landlords, the council, benefits advice organisations and a gentleman from the Department for Work and Pensions, whom I thank. I told the audience, &#8220;Do not shoot the messenger. Department for Work and Pensions staff are there to deliver on a policy devised by politicians.&#8221; Some horrendous stories were told. The aim of the event was to encourage those working in the community to look for the tell-tale signs of families starting to feel the pressure as a result of the bedroom tax or universal credit.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40429" name="Katy Clark">the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark)</phrase> was right to highlight the amount of money that this will take out of the local economy. When we debated the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Bill, I pointed out that the 1% freeze would take money out of the local economy and away from some of our poorest</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/9">people. That will also happen as a result of this provision. Taking money out of the local economy does not stimulate it, and does serious damage.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/10">My local authority, Dumfries and Galloway council, has a Conservative and SNP administration. Some months ago, it set up a welfare reform working group. My Labour colleagues, who make up the largest political grouping on the council but are in opposition, did not take part in that group. Instead, they established their own welfare reform working group. The report by the Labour group came before the council&#8217;s policy and resources committee yesterday. Lo and behold, the Conservative leader of the council accepted all 21 recommendations the Labour councillors put forward. I will not go through them all, but they include an urgent report on the legal and financial implications of using discretionary housing benefit to cover any shortfall in the first year for those affected by the tax, and a report on the proposal to expand access to credit unions and to explore other banking options for bad debtors.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/11">The Conservative leader of the council accepted the recommendations wholeheartedly, but he took the matter a step further. He decided that it was right for Dumfries and Galloway council to write to Lord Freud to make him aware that the steps he was taking, especially the bedroom tax, were wrong. The leader of the council said on the radio this morning:</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/12">&#8220;In Dumfries and Galloway we&#8217;ve taken the decision in the past that we don&#8217;t see one bedroom being the ideal situation. Two bedrooms is what we&#8217;ve been basing our housing strategy on in the past and we feel that the minimum should be two bedrooms rather than one bedroom when they are looking at under-occupancy legislation. This is something that we feel that we need to push harder on for our tenants across the region.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.411.0/13">That comes from a Conservative leader of a local authority in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.412.0/1">When I listen to the Government, I wonder what world they live in. It certainly is not the world of the 2,400 tenants of Bolton at Home or the 4,500 tenants of Wigan and Leigh Housing who are facing unaffordable bills because the Government have decided that the poor should pay the price for the wrongs of the rich.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.0/2">The Government have a fundamental ignorance about social housing and a thoroughly disgraceful attitude towards people who, through choice or circumstance, are living in council or housing association properties. They seem to think that it is a negative choice and that everyone, whatever their circumstances, should aspire to own a home. It is as if they have learned nothing from the sub-prime catastrophe.</p>

	<p pid="b.412.2/1">I will not because other Members want to speak.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/2">Social houses are homes: homes that are usually occupied by people who cannot afford to buy a house because they do not earn enough or because they cannot work; homes that people live in for many years; homes that tenants lavish care and attention on; homes that they hope to live in until they choose to downsize to a flat or until they die; homes that their children may</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/3">move back into when they finish university or when relationships break down; homes that families come to visit and where grandchildren come to stay; homes that are part of a community that benefits from stability and from established residents who make a contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/4">The Government do not seem to think about homes and communities, but merely about spare bedrooms. When they talk about overcrowding, they do not look at where the so-called spare bedrooms are and where the overcrowding is. Unfortunately, the two do not match. They also do not consider who will lose out. What they are doing is like shuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic. They are simply moving the problem, not solving it.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/5">Bolton and Wigan do not have spare one and two-bedroom properties, so tenants will have to starve or freeze to pay the additional rent, move to the private rented sector or be evicted for arrears. The Minister suggests that people should work more hours. If only it were that simple in Tory-Lib Dem Britain to get a job. Even if people can get a job, the Minister ignores the fact that every time people earn more money, they lose benefits. How will that help to cover the gap?</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/6">The Minister also says that the measures will drive down housing benefit costs. Wigan and Leigh Housing has done its own modelling. If about a quarter of its tenants moved into the private rented sector, there would be an additional cost to the Department for Work and Pensions of more than half a million pounds. It also estimates that the cost to Wigan and Leigh Housing would be more than &#163;10 million, which would come from a different public purse. That includes &#163;1.4 million for the adaptation of new homes for the disabled and &#163;300,000 for rent collection. This measure will, of course, affect other tenants as well as the ability of housing associations to repair and maintain housing stock, and it will prevent them building new homes. One housing provider has said that it will lose one new build a week because of the cumulative affect of welfare reform.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/7">Government Members like to throw out the accusation that the previous Labour Government introduced the same policy for the private rented sector with the local housing allowance, but they should stop listening to their own spin. The LHA was tested for four years before it was introduced and did not apply to existing tenants but just to new claimants or people moving house. It did not specify how many bedrooms people should have, but allocated a sum of money based on the median rent for properties of the relevant size. Therefore, if a family found a house with more space for a lower rent, they could move in. The size of the housing benefit bill is due to the cost of private rents, not social housing. However, the Government will not do anything about fair rent and instead just reduce the chances of ordinary people to find houses. I also wonder when Government Members last visited a council house and looked at the size of the so-called third bedroom. Often, it is a room that barely fits a bed and would be unbearable for two teenagers with no space to do homework or hang up clothes. It is certainly not the sort of space that a lodger would want to rent.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/8">My hon. Friends have mentioned the difficulties of expecting children with vastly different ages to share a bedroom, and the difficulties experienced by families with a disabled member. Let me lay out the nature of the Government&#8217;s policy. A family with two children</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/9">under 10 in a three-bedroom house will now need to move to a two-bedroom house. When a child turns 10, they will need to go to a three-bedroom house but if one child moves out, they will have to go to a two-bedroom house. If both children move out, they will have to move to a one-bedroom home, but what about if one child wants to come home? What about the cost of this measure? Will children have to move school? What happens to the community? This policy is nonsense.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/10">Others have spoken in detail about the situation of separated couples, but I have one question: will mothers allow their children to stop with their father overnight if the father is in a bedsit and the child has to share a bed with dad or sleep on the couch? The Government just have not thought this through.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/11">I have already spoken in this House about Isabel and her son Carl who has Down&#8217;s syndrome, so I will finish by talking briefly about two people who came to see me last week as a result of my asking the Prime Minister whether he had ever met anyone who was losing their home because of the bedroom tax. The Prime Minister replied that he often met service people in his constituency, although he did not tell us whether they were losing their homes. Stephen and Bill came to see me because they are ex-servicemen.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/12">Stephen and his wife told me that for them this policy feels like persecution. Stephen served for 17 years in the Air Force and then continued to work. He became ill and lost his house; he has had two back operations and has irritable bowel syndrome. His wife is suffering from depression. Stephen has been in his council house for 22 years and told me that he feels that he has made a huge contribution to this country and cannot understand why in his hour of need the country is turning its back on him.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/13">I cannot talk about all of the situation of the other person, Bill, who came to see me, but he lives in an adapted house with a carport, ramp, walk-in shower and stair-lift. Bill is disabled, has anxiety and depression, and IBS. He lives close to his family and gets support from them&#8212;and he gives them support; his son is serving in Afghanistan. He is anxious about the bedroom tax and is trying to be proactive, but because of his needs, accommodation is limited. Bill says that the only thing he has to live for in his life is his fishing and he is worried to death that he will not have room for his fishing gear in any other accommodation. He is considering suicide.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.2/14">This is not scaremongering; it is the reality of people&#8217;s lives.</p>

	<p pid="b.414.2/1">In Wales, some 40,000 households will be affected by the under-occupancy penalty or bedroom tax, which is 46% of working-age social housing tenants who receive housing benefit. That is one of the highest percentages of any area in the UK, well above the UK average of 31%, and is due to the nature of the housing stock which is mostly three-bedroom houses. In my county of Carmarthenshire the</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/2">housing department has identified 1,341 households that will be hit, 860 of which are in my constituency. At least the department is being proactive and trying to find people and help them, but it is an impossible task.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/3">We have heard a good deal today about the range of people who should be regarded as exceptional cases, and I endorse the idea that people such as foster carers and those in specially adapted properties should not be penalised. The fact remains, however, that many people of working age in social housing are vulnerable individuals but do not count among those who will receive discretionary treatment. They have often been allocated social housing because they are in need&#8212;because they have, for example, mental health problems. Clearly, the discretionary money falls far short of what will be needed to cover the whole of the shortfall for those in need.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/4">Where does that leave us? All hon. Members understand that some households have a spare room. That is simply because the overwhelming majority of council housing and housing association housing is three-bedroomed. In an ideal world, we would free up the three-bedroom properties for families who need them, but that cannot be done overnight. People have sometimes had to accept those homes because they are the only ones available. In recent years, housing associations have built one and two-bedroom properties, and Carmarthenshire county council, my local authority, is building some small bungalows, but they are already in great demand, and there is no way that local authorities can suddenly build enough new properties to accommodate all those who will be affected by the under-occupancy penalty.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/5">Many of those who move to the available one and two-bedroom properties are pensioners, who are mercifully exempted from the bedroom tax. The problem, however, is simply that there are not enough one and two-bedroom properties. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40597" name="Geraint Davies">the Member for Swansea West (Geraint Davies)</phrase> spoke of incentives, but even without incentives, many people want to downsize when their children grow up&#8212;downsizing means that properties are easier to look after, and people often recognise the social value of giving up their property to a family and moving into a smaller one. However, they cannot do that if there are no properties to move into.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/6">Let us look at the reality of what will happen. Let us be clear: people on low incomes just do not have extra money to cover the extra rent. As is explained in the House of Commons briefing, the amount of money that people receive in benefits has never been based exactly on need. There has always been a compromise between need and what could attract political support, but the fact remains that people on benefits live on scarcely enough to cover basic needs. There is already a massive squeeze on household budgets, with relentless price rises for essential items such as food, energy bills and bus fares. Those on the lowest incomes suffer the most, because they have no spare cash and have already cut back on anything that is not essential.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/7">Many people will try to stay where they are to avoid disruption to their family and their children&#8217;s schooling, or the increased bus fares they would have to pay if they moved away. They will desperately try to pay the additional rent from their meagre budgets. That will mean people turning off heating and cutting back on food, and trying their utmost not to spend anything extra. However,</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/8">the chances are that, despite their best efforts to keep their secured council house tenancy, because they value that and realise how difficult life is in the private sector, where they are pushed from pillar to post, they are likely to fall into arrears. That will have a negative impact on council housing and housing association budgets and cash flows, and leave less money for maintenance and new build.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/9">Once a family falls into arrears, their problems will spiral. They will be prey to loan sharks as they try to make ends meet. What happens if they are evicted? The council will have to re-house them. They could end up in bed and breakfast or other privately rented property, all of which would be more expensive than the amount saved by imposing a bedroom tax on the extra room in their house. The trouble is that some private accommodation is only temporary&#8212;the family will move from pillar to post, with all the educational disruption that that will cause for their children.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/10">The private sector has problems, because there is a lot of pressure from young professional couples who do not have the job security or deposit to buy their own homes. They are pushing up prices and taking the more desirable private properties. Another problem is that, although we have passed legislation to license landlords, it is taking a while for local authorities to do so. There is a lot of backlog in driving up standards and decency in private sector homes, which are often sadly lacking.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/11">Just one aspect of that problem&#8212;letting agents&#8212;is being covered by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40694" name="Sarah Champion">the Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion)</phrase> in the debate in Westminster Hall this afternoon. There is so much to tackle in the private sector to bring it up to standard.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.2/12">If we take into account the cost of administering discretionary payments and the difficulties of trying to share them fairly, when there is clearly not enough money to go around, we realise that it would be far better not to implement the bedroom tax. It would be far better to stimulate growth, get more jobs and more people in work, and therefore increase the tax take. There would then be a chance to get the deficit down. In the meantime, we could use the money from the 4G sell-off to build more homes so we have less of a housing crisis.</p>

	<p pid="b.416.0/1">I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase> for bringing the motion before the House. This is a serious issue that is proving to be stressful for a great many vulnerable people&#8212;the elderly, single parents and disabled couples&#8212;and that stress is affecting their health. That point has been made eloquently at Prime Minister&#8217;s questions and throughout this debate. The Minister is greatly respected and well thought of in all parts of the Chamber for the way he responds to a great many points. My questions and comments are meant constructively, and I would like him to respond to them.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/2">In Northern Ireland, we are faced with 2,000 households in social housing&#8212;whether housing executive tenants or housing association tenants&#8212;facing a major shortfall in their rent of up to 25%. That means a tremendous number of families are unsure of how and where they will live. I am aware that in many parts of Great Britain</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/3">there are many more smaller social homes with one or two bedrooms, and tenants who want to move have a realistic chance of downsizing to a property the cost of which will be covered by their benefit. That is not the case in Northern Ireland and, while we have started to build smaller apartments and homes, we have nowhere near the necessary number to begin to implement this reform and to move people who cannot afford to pay the difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/4">I was a councillor for 26 years before I came to this Chamber. One measure that I pushed for as a councillor 20-odd years ago was for the executive to upgrade its one-bedroom bungalows to two bedrooms. It has taken nearly 20 years for that to happen. Today, we wish we could turn back the clock&#8212;the film &#8220;Back to the Future&#8221; comes to mind. The very thing that we pushed for 20 years ago has to be turned back&#8212;a matter of great concern. The Minister for Social Development in Northern Ireland has no option but to implement these reforms, as the Northern Ireland block grant does not allow for a delay. However, his Department is in no way, shape or form ready to follow through on the legislation that has come before this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/5">In Northern Ireland, it has been estimated that there will be a housing benefit shortfall of &#163;10 million per year, and I doubt that there are many people on housing benefit who can afford to make up that money themselves. The Minister for Social Development, Nelson McCausland, has said:</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/6">&#8220;The best way forward is the use of discretionary housing payments. We have increased the money there for those that may be affected.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/7">Yet again, it must be stressed that the Northern Ireland Executive cannot bear the load of these changes out of the block grant, and that will inevitably lead to severe hardship for many families in Northern Ireland, as it will&#8212;I know this from hon. Members who have spoken&#8212;on the mainland in Scotland, Wales and England. Elderly widows have been ringing me to ask whether they will be expected, at their time of life, to take in a lodger in their two-bedroom homes. Their fear is palpable, and the state should never be guilty of enforcing that on them.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/8">For some, the new rules will reduce their existing housing benefit by &#163;650 per year. The bottom line will be that if they cannot afford that, they will have to find a new house. The scenario I would like to put to the Minister is this: a divorced mother has two children, a son of nine and a daughter of eight. The new rules say that the children can share a bedroom and the family therefore have to downsize their home. However, that will apply for only a year because the children will no longer have to share when they are 10 and nine, and the rules state that they will then need an extra bedroom. Would it be economical to expect the household to move, or will the housing benefit section have the discretion to waive this tax in those circumstances? How far does this discretion extend? Does it allow for the disabled couple who cannot sleep together and need a carer to sleep in the house at times to help with their care needs? Are they expected to foot the bill because they are disabled and need help?</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/9">We recently spoke in this House about needing more foster carers and touched on the effects on them. I do not want to repeat what has been said, but by the same token people on housing benefit will be penalised for</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/10">trying to offer a home to young people who need some love and care. I have to ask: where is the big society in that?</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/11">I could go on, but time is limited. We are not ready to implement this either morally or physically. We lambast absent fathers for not playing an active role in their children&#8217;s upbringing. We then tell them that they are not allowed to have a bedroom for their child to stay in when they are trying to build a relationship through their visitation rights. We tell people who are married and working, &#8220;We have no houses for you in the housing executive, so you will need to rent privately and we will help you with the payments.&#8221; We then say, &#8220;Well, your private rented house is one bedroom too large, so we won&#8217;t help you with this payment anymore, and we can&#8217;t rehouse you so you can find a smaller home close enough for your child to walk to school. As you have no car, there is nothing that can be done for you.&#8221; Hon. Members&#8212;on both sides of the House, to be fair&#8212;have asked, &#8220;Is this really what the House advocates?&#8221; I would say not. I and many other Members do not advocate it. Single tenants regularly come to me, and like others, I am sure, I have helped hundreds with their housing benefit. Often, we find that, because of their age, they are restricted in how much housing benefit they can get. The discretionary payment fund helps them that wee bit along life&#8217;s road, but then we find that this payment, which helps them to develop their quality of life, get a job and so on, is being taken away from them.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.0/12">We need to make changes to the housing sector, but we cannot enforce changes without the infrastructure in place to implement them. I do not want to be part of a measure that puts 32,000 families in housing stress. Is this something that the Minister is prepared to implement before the foundations have been laid? I hope that he will allow the infrastructure and details to be put in place before this is pushed through.</p>

	<p pid="b.418.0/1">It is a genuine pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" name="Jim Shannon">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase>. It is clear from the testimonies of my hon. Friends that the consequences of this ill-thought-out tax on families will be enormous. I fear that the great number of letters that my hon. Friends and I have received from families up and down the country who are extremely worried about their futures as a result of these changes is just the tip of the iceberg&#8212;thousands of people who will be affected by the bedroom tax do not yet know it.</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/2">Analysis by the National Housing Federation shows that the bedroom tax will hit 2,000 families in my constituency&#8212;each to the tune of more than &#163;500 a year&#8212;and every day I hear from constituents worried about how they will cope. The economy of my constituency is based on public spending. It needs to be rebalanced, and I have worked consistently to do that, but this latest blow will undoubtedly hit economic demand in my constituency even further, making that task even harder. The bedroom tax will have an effect on my local high street, businesses and other economic activities, and the same will be the case in constituencies and communities across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/3">We need to speak to housing officers from social housing providers about the bedroom tax. They know</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/4">who the good and bad tenants are on their patches. I used to be one myself.</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/5" class="italic">[Laughter.]</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/6">A housing officer, not a bad tenant, that is! We need to ask them how the bedroom tax will affect their tenants, and they will say that, for some, it will be crucifying. Not everyone can move to different properties, because they are not available, so instead some will be faced with paying a tax they simply cannot avoid. This tax demonstrates what we all know&#8212;that the Government come up with policies that are ill-thought-out, damaging and disproportionately targeted at the least well-off in our society.</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/7">Instead of spending their time cobbling together disjointed, contradictory and weak justifications for the shameful bedroom tax, the Government should do the right thing and drop it. I can think of few more embarrassing, cringe-worthy illustrations of a rotten defence of a rotten policy than that provided by the Minister in the Lords, Lord Freud, on BBC Radio 5 Live recently, when he told concerned social housing tenants that they should seek to take in lodgers in order to pay the tax. How delusional, how detached, how dangerous! Here we have a Minister telling people that to pay the Government&#8217;s punitive tax, they should break the terms of their tenancy agreements and so risk eviction. I would urge students of bad policy, bad communication, bad government and political incompetence to read a transcript of the noble Lord&#8217;s interview.</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/8">The Government claim that the bedroom tax will solve the issue of under-occupancy. Has it not occurred to them that the people affected will not be able to avoid it? All the policy will mean is that low-income families will be hit in the pocket. It is a tax on the poor. It means less money available for food, groceries, school trips and school uniforms, heating and transport. It is a policy of the madhouse that will push people closer to the poorhouse. Alongside the Tory NHS Bill, Liberal Democrat support for this marks the point at which they have become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Conservative party.</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/9">There simply are not the excess houses available for people to move into. The Secretary of State has offered no solution to the mismatch between families&#8217; needs and the accommodation available. This mismatch is highlighted in his Department&#8217;s own policy assessment, so what are the Government going to do about it? What kind of dysfunctional Department is he running, when fundamental issues arising from such massive changes have not even been considered?</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/10">Like, I suspect, hon. Members on both sides of the House, I have many constituents who will be hit by the bedroom tax. Oblivious to the impact of his own policies, the Prime Minister said again today that he was happy to look at individual cases, and I will be sure to forward him the many that I have already received. Perhaps he will be able to explain to the divorced father in my constituency who has joint custody of his children where his children will stay when they are with him. Perhaps he will also be able to explain to the many disabled people in my constituency, who have already had their homes adapted to suit their needs, why they are being penalised. And perhaps he can explain to the parents in my constituency whose children are serving</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/11">our country in our armed forces why their mandated time away from home will either hit their pockets or cost them their homes.</p>
	<p pid="b.418.0/12">The actions of this Government have left many people with no option but to lower their living standards or lose their homes. It is no wonder that the Secretary of State is known as the quiet man&#8212;he has much to be quiet about. This bedroom tax is unacceptable, indefensible and increasingly typical. It will not be forgotten.</p>

	<p pid="b.420.0/1">I am glad to rise to sum up on behalf of Plaid Cymru, the Scottish National party and the Green party. We have heard 26 speakers in the debate today, including the Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40606" name="Steve Webb">the hon. Member for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)</phrase>, which is ample proof that we made the correct choice in putting this subject up for debate. I will try to mention all the speakers briefly, although I am anxious to allow the Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40663" name="Esther McVey">the hon. Member for Wirral West (Esther McVey)</phrase> ample time to defend her Government&#8217;s position. To that end, I might sit down a little early.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/2">The debate was opened by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40054" name="Eilidh Whiteford">the Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)</phrase>, who pointed out that the proposed penalty was inherently unfair, that it had structural problems and that it would hit disabled people, foster carers, separated parents and many others. She outlined some mitigation measures that could be taken, but her choice&#8212;and that of my right hon. and hon. Friends and me&#8212;is that the Government should abandon the penalty.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/3">The Minister of State then gave us a clear explanation, as he always does. I will not go into the details of his speech, but he made some interesting points. He stated clearly that one of the purposes of the penalty was to save money; we would argue that that is its main purpose. He also said, to some surprise, that these were Labour cuts. I thought that it was the Conservative and Liberal parties that were in government, and that Labour was in opposition, but there we are. That is what he said. He also said that there was a spare room subsidy. We have been calling it a bedroom tax. May I suggest that we all call it a penalty? It will be a penalty on ordinary people.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40083" name="Liam Byrne">The right hon. Member for Birmingham, Hodge Hill (Mr Byrne)</phrase> discussed the problems that will arise from the penalty, especially in a time of recession, and the problems that people would face in moving when there was no possibility of their doing so. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40338" name="Kris Hopkins">The hon. Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins)</phrase>, who is no longer in his place, talked about his constituency. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40273" name="Ann McKechin">The hon. Member for Glasgow North (Ann McKechin)</phrase> said that the Government were unprepared, that great disruption would be caused, and that we needed solutions for housing problems as a whole, and not just in terms of the money involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40356" name="Greg Mulholland">The hon. Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> explained his position with some care and eloquence, and I hope that he might be persuaded to join us in the Lobby this evening, rather than abstaining. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40423" name="Jessica Morden">The hon. Member for Newport East (Jessica Morden)</phrase> outlined some heartrending cases and talked about the nature of the Welsh stock. She made a point that many other hon. Members made, which was that many people</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/6">have no choice. The Government might think that there is a choice, but there ain&#8217;t. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40064" name="Jane Ellison">The hon. Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison)</phrase> called on Labour to pledge to reverse the measure if it was in government, and that reasonable request is echoed on these Benches as well. However, I do not think that she quite understood the delightful intricacies of devolution, or the fact that the SNP is actually in government in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40121" name="Caroline Lucas">The hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase>, who apologises for being unable to be here this evening, highlighted the Kafkaesque point that if the Government&#8217;s intentions are carried out, they will save no money&#8212;that is, that people would move and no money would be saved. She also talked at some length about other practical points, and ended by saying that while the banks got bailed out, the poor got thrown out. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">The right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> recognised the difficulties involved in downsizing, and emphasised the value of incentives rather than penalties. He also talked about eligibility, and I am afraid that he then strayed into the immigration debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/8">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> gave the House a riveting explanation of the situation in Scotland. He also pointed out that 79% of the households in Scotland had a disabled person living in them, which is an even higher figure than for England or Wales.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/9"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">The hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> overstated the case. Initially, I thought he was falling into the schoolboy error of overstating people&#8217;s case in order to knock it down more easily. Then, however, I realised that he actually believes this stuff.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/10"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40429" name="Katy Clark">The hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark)</phrase> pointed out some problems that will arise and spoke about the misery that will be caused. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40100" name="Yasmin Qureshi">The hon. Member for Bolton South East (Yasmin Qureshi)</phrase> said that, in reality, spare rooms are not spare. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40150" name="Jonathan Edwards">the Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards)</phrase> outlined some of the factual background and outlined ways in which these sort of problems are tackled elsewhere&#8212;in Ireland and the USA, for example.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/11"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40688" name="Iain McKenzie">The hon. Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie)</phrase> supported the motion, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40597" name="Geraint Davies">the hon. Member for Swansea West (Geraint Davies)</phrase> spoke in his own inimitable style about the impact on working class people. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40514" name="Tom Greatrex">The hon. Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex)</phrase> talked about the problems for foster parents, which are indeed severe and need to be looked at again.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/12"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40089" name="Helen Goodman">The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman)</phrase> gave us a very interesting account of her attempts to live on benefit. It might well be a salutary lesson for some Conservative Members to repeat the experience she had in that respect. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" name="Sheila Gilmore">The hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore)</phrase> outlined many of the practical difficulties, while <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40274" name="William Bain">the hon. Member for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain)</phrase> talked about the macro-economic effects and the blow to local economies.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40213" name="Russell Brown">The hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown)</phrase> spoke about the effects on disabled people and on the poorest, and called for ameliorating measures. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" name="Julie Hilling">The hon. Member for Bolton West (Julie Hilling)</phrase> talked about the effect on local housing providers and the effect on real families&#8212;not the families of the Government&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/14">imagination. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40375" name="Nia Griffith">The hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase> talked about the inflexible nature of the housing stock and the consequences from it, while <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40586" name="Jim Shannon">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase> gave us a welcome perspective from Northern Ireland and spoke about the problems this penalty will cause there. Last but not least, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40183" name="Jamie Reed">the hon. Member for Copeland (Mr Reed)</phrase> said that what we have heard this afternoon is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/15">As I said, we have heard 26 speakers. However seductively the Minister will present her arguments, it is clear to the House this afternoon that the Government&#8217;s main aim is to cut the housing budget, taking money from the pockets of some of those least able to afford it. As has been said, two thirds of those affected are disabled or have disabled partners, and I point out that half the people affected have been tenants for 10 years or more. Conservative Members are fond of complaining about crime and disorder on estates. These longer-term tenants are the sort of people we want to stay on estates to give leadership to the local communities, but they are the people who will be moved on by this penalty.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/16">As has been mentioned, 46% of housing benefit claimants will be affected in Wales compared with 31% for Great Britain in general, showing that this is a particular problem for Wales. My own local authority of Gwynedd is a case in point as 1,378 families will lose between &#163;8 and &#163;24 a week. If they try to follow the Government&#8217;s advice and move within the housing stock, they will encounter difficulties, especially if they try to move into the private sector. People wanting to move within the stock in Gwynedd will face competition from the tourism industry, which has proper needs that should be addressed by the local housing stock. In the city of Bangor, the people wanting to move will be competing with many thousands of students. What are they looking for? They are looking for one-bedroom or two-bedroom properties&#8212;for small places. Those will be the local effects stemming from this change.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/17">The Government say, of course, that people could find work. Average incomes in my area are &#163;15,000 a year, and I have no idea how people are going to find the &#163;700 to pay this penalty when they are not able to move. I do not think that the Government have thought that through; and if they have thought it through, they do not care. I can tell the Minister that it is not just a matter of taking up a few hours of extra work serving in a shop or working in a care home. Taking more work is not a possibility when hundreds of people are chasing every job, and when disabled people always come at the end of the queue when the jobs are being handed out.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/18">Perhaps we should be charitable to the Government. They say that they are introducing this change to improve occupancy, and&#8212;as the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40487" name="Stephen Crabb">the hon. Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Stephen Crabb)</phrase>, said this morning&#8212;to alleviate homelessness. However, there are currently 19,000 homeless people in Wales, and I think that this measure will merely add to that total. Some people will say, &#8220;We will pay.&#8221; Some will say, &#8220;We will do without, and we will pay.&#8221; Some will be forced to say, &#8220;There is nothing left to do without, and we will not be able to pay.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.420.0/19">It seems that it is up to me, as a mere Welsh nationalist, to draw the Government&#8217;s attention to the English saying &#8220;An Englishman&#8217;s home is his castle.&#8221; They assail that castle at their peril.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.423.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40663" speakername="Esther McVey" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Work and Pensions"  colnum="423"  time="018:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227-0004.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.423.0/1">I thank Members on both sides of the House for their valuable contributions to this important debate. It is good to have an opportunity to respond to a number of the points that were raised, and also to correct some inaccuracies.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/2">Having listened to the whole debate, I know that there are some issues on which we all agree. Consensus is an important point at which to start, because we are all looking for a solution to a problem that the coalition Government have been handed, so I will begin by listing the facts on which we are agreed.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/3">There is a considerable lack of social homes, because very few have been built in recent years. The Secretary of State has referred to a complete collapse in the building of social housing under the last Government. Housing benefit has doubled in the last 10 years. We all agree that we will have to manage the bill for that, but how are we going to deal with it? How are we going to find a solution to such a large problem? We all probably agree, too, that fairness must be at the heart of that solution: fairness to those who are in overcrowded homes, fairness to those who are under-occupying, and fairness to the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/4">Let me begin, however, with the removal of discrepancies in the rented sector between those who are privately renting and those who are socially renting. An arrangement whereby people living next door to each other are renting under different systems is innately unfair, and must be addressed. I think all Members will be pleased to hear that I shall be taking Labour&#8217;s lead in this instance. Labour introduced the local housing allowance for private sector tenants who did not receive housing benefit for a spare bedroom, which seems a good point at which to start. We are doing the same, in that we are introducing equality in the system for everyone who is renting.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/5">The second issue that we must tackle is the problem of people who are living in overcrowded accommodation. As my hon. Friend the Minister of State said, a quarter of a million people are in that position. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase>, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40064" name="Jane Ellison">the Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison)</phrase> also mentioned those people, but Opposition Members refused to discuss them.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/6">We also all agree that we are talking about family homes. They are not just houses; people have lived in them. That is why we have exempted those who are above the state pension credit age. We recognise that pensioners would be particularly affected by these changes. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40173" name="Stephen Mosley">the Member for City of Chester (Stephen Mosley)</phrase> reminded Labour Members what they had repeated time and again. They must get a grip of the housing benefit bill. They never managed to do that in government, but they must do it if they are to be even a credible Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/7">My hon. Friend the Member for Battersea made a very important point. When Opposition Members said that they would vote against the measure because they disagreed with it, she challenged them by asking whether they would reverse it and put that in their manifesto. Silence came from the Opposition Benches.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/8">On discretionary housing payments, many Members raised specific issues and complex cases. Specific groups</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/9">were identified, such as foster carers and people who live in houses with major disability adaptations. Rather than central Government defining exactly what should happen in every case, we have allocated the money we think is needed and given it to local authorities so they can respond on a case-by-case basis. Such local discretion is right. We might think that many different individuals should be exempt, but it would be impossible to write that into regulations and statutory instruments. That is why we have allocated discretionary housing payments of &#163;60 million this year and &#163;155 million next year to local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/10">In the past, discretionary payments have been seen as a temporary fix for a short-term problem. However, under the new system these new payments can be for the long term, because some situations will not change, and if someone lives in a house that has been substantially adapted, they will need to keep it.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/11">We have debated this subject for over six hours and many inaccurate things were said and many questions were raised and remained unanswered, so I will canter through quite a few of them. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">The hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase> asked about children at university. Children absent at college are covered by the normal rates of absences and will not be affected if they are returning for holidays. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40356" name="Greg Mulholland">the Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland)</phrase> asked whether people can apply ahead of their need arising. They can: they can apply for these payments now, although, obviously, they will not be paid until the payment is needed.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/12">The hon. Members for Dundee East and for Strangford (Jim Shannon) asked about people with a disability who need an overnight carer. Obviously, they are exempt, regardless of whether they need an overnight carer all the time or just occasionally. Again, Opposition Members got their facts wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/13"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40213" name="Russell Brown">The hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown)</phrase> questioned the number of spare bedrooms. There are 1 million spare bedrooms in properties occupied by working-age people alone, so that does not include pensioners. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40273" name="Ann McKechin">The hon. Member for Glasgow North (Ann McKechin)</phrase> asked why Lord Freud could not attend a meeting. He could not do so because he was involved in a debate in the other place. However, I am happy to confirm that he will make that visit very soon. That is being arranged with the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.0/14"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40655" name="Karen Buck">The hon. Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck)</phrase> said that if people are moving around, this policy will not save any money. That is incorrect. She is not taking account of the previous circumstances of the people who will be moving into the vacated properties. <i>[Interruption.] </i>They may have been in more expensive private or temporary accommodation, so this dynamic benefit will save money. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Opposition Members are perpetuating inaccurate myths.<i> [Interruption.]</i></p>

	<p pid="b.430.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.430.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That the draft Bank of England Act 1998 (Macro-prudential Measures) Order 2013, which was laid before this House on <phrase class="date" code="2013-01-24">24 January</phrase>, be approved.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.2/3">One of the most significant failings of the previous system for regulating financial services was the lack of clear responsibility for financial stability. It has been all too easy for the identification and management of risks to financial stability to fall in the cracks between what those organisations believed were their respective roles in protecting and promoting stability in the financial sector. That confusion was a key contributing factor to the emergence of the financial crisis in 2007. None of the institutions involved was effectively horizon-scanning to identify macro-prudential risks to stability across the financial system.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.2/4">In the light of those failings, the Bank of England Act 1998, as amended by the Financial Services Act 2012, gave the Bank of England clear responsibility for financial stability. To support that objective, the Act creates a new committee of the Bank, the Financial Policy Committee, with the role of identifying, monitoring and managing systemic risks to the UK financial system. In order to carry out that role, the FPC will need macro-prudential measures to mitigate the risks to stability it identifies. The FPC will act through the regulators, which work directly with financial institutions.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.2/5">The FPC will do that in two ways: first, through recommendations, which can be made to the regulators, to industry, to the Treasury, within the Bank and to other persons; and, secondly, through directions that can be given to the Prudential Regulatory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. The FPC&#8217;s direction power is governed by the measures set out in the order before the House. The regulators must comply with a direction, but they will have discretion over its timing and implementation method.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.2/6">Before discussing the measures that will be granted to the FPC, it is worth noting that there is an international consensus on the need for macro-prudential regulation. International regulations such as Basel III and the capital requirements directive IV go some way towards establishing minimum standards while retaining room for national discretion, although areas such as the leverage ratio remain under discussion. The UK strongly supports the ability of national supervisors to exercise discretion where appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.2/7">In February 2011 the Government and the Bank established an interim FPC to undertake, as far as possible, the work of the statutory FPC ahead of the passing of the relevant legislation. One of the tasks set for the interim FPC was to analyse and recommend macro-prudential measures over which the statutory FPC would have direction-making powers.</p>

	<p pid="b.431.0/1">The Minister has just mentioned the leverage ratio. There are two crucial issues: first, the leverage ratio should be firmly in the hands of the FPC, not the Government; and, secondly, the UK should be able to act unilaterally, rather than necessarily having to wait indefinitely for international agreement&#8212;we should not move at the speed of the slowest. Indeed, the United States demonstrates how necessary that is. Does the Minister agree with that sentiment and, if so, why is that not reflected in what he is announcing today?</p>

	<p pid="b.431.1/1">As my hon. Friend knows, that has been a matter of much debate in the Treasury Committee and the Banking Commission, both of which he chairs. It is appropriate to have regard to the international debate on this. There is a difference between the debate on the leverage ratio and the two other tools that we will move on to talk about, the sectoral capital requirements and the counter-cyclical buffer, over which, it has been established internationally, there should be domestic discretion. We are not at that stage with the leverage ratio, as he will know, but I can certainly confirm to the House that the Government&#8217;s intention is to provide the FPC with a time-varying leverage ratio by 2018, subject to a review by the European Banking Authority, which is planned for 2017.</p>

	<p pid="b.431.2/1">I am intrigued by the Minister&#8217;s 2018 commitment, but would it not make good and prudent legislative sense to take the opportunity in the draft Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill, which will arrive in the House imminently, to insert provisions that would allow the leverage ratio to be triggered sooner if there is a delay in the international discussions?</p>

	<p pid="b.431.3/1">We do not expect such a delay. The discussions are continuing and are live, as we know, so we do not expect to need that, but of course it is open to the House as it debates the Bill, presumably at some length, to keep that under review as the discussions progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/2">The statutory instrument we are debating today relates specifically to the ability to set sectoral capital requirements. I will deal with that tool first before briefly covering the others. The interim FPC recommended that the statutory FPC should have a power of direction to vary financial institutions&#8217; capital requirements against exposures to specific sectors over time. It argued that the over-exuberance that precedes crises often begins in specific sectors before spreading further. The Government agree that this targeted approach would allow these risks to be managed more effectively and proportionately than raising capital requirements more generally. The FPC has stated that it would wish to avoid what it terms an</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/3">&#8220;overly activist, fine-tuning approach&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/4">which should limit this risk. However, there may be times when using the tools in a granular way may be necessary, so the Government will keep the use of this tool under review to ensure that it is being used effectively and proportionately. There is also a risk that imposing sector-specific requirements could displace excessive risk into other sectors, so the FPC will need to monitor carefully the impact of any policy interventions using</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/5">this tool and perhaps consider adjusting more general capital requirements if displacement turns out to be a significant problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/6">I should take this opportunity to bring to the House&#8217;s attention the one change that the Government have made to the order following the consultation that we undertook on the draft version that was made available for that purpose. The current order excludes investment firms that are not regulated by the PRA from the FPC&#8217;s power. This will ensure that systemically important firms are captured while smaller firms that are not systemically important will not be subject to additional requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/7">Let me discuss briefly the other macro-prudential tools that the Government intend to give the FPC: the role of setting the UK&#8217;s counter-cyclical capital buffer; and, as we have briefly discussed, the power to intervene to limit leverage ratios. These are not covered by the draft order, but it might be useful if I provide a bit of context to the debate. The counter-cyclical capital buffer is part of the Basel III agreement, and it will be implemented in Europe by the capital requirements directive, commonly known as CRD 4. The directive aims to ensure that banking sector capital requirements take account of the macro-financial environment in which banks operate. It will be deployed by national jurisdictions when excess aggregate credit growth is judged to be associated with a build-up of system-wide risk to ensure that the banking system has a buffer of capital to protect it against future losses. Banks, building societies and larger investment firms will be required to build up capital during upturns. This will help to increase the resilience of the financial system and might also dampen the credit cycle. Unwinding these requirements in the downturn once the threat has passed might help to mitigate contractions in the supply of lending.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/8">It is clear that with its macro-prudential focus, the FPC will be the body best placed to determine the level of the counter-cyclical capital buffer. This was supported by the results of the Government&#8217;s consultation. As the counter-cyclical capital buffer is expected to be provided for in CRD 4, on which discussions are continuing, the simplest way to incorporate it into UK law is via regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 to transpose into UK law the provisions of CRD 4 which relate to the counter-cyclical capital buffer.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/9">It is vital that the FPC&#8217;s decisions in relation to the counter-cyclical capital buffer should be subject to comparable procedural and reporting requirements to the FPC&#8217;s other tools. Therefore, in addition to the requirements imposed by the EU legislation, the Government intend to ensure that the counter-cyclical capital buffer will be subject to the same transparency requirements as other FPC decisions, with a summary of the FPC&#8217;s discussions when taking decisions on the buffer set out in the FPC&#8217;s meeting records, and the FPC&#8217;s use of the buffer covered in the biannual financial stability report. The Government will make any necessary changes to achieve this in the regulations that incorporate CRD 4 into UK law.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/10">The interim FPC recommended that the statutory FPC should have a power of direction to set and vary a minimum leverage ratio. The Government think that a leverage ratio could indeed be a useful macro-prudential tool for the FPC. The unweighted nature of the measure</p>
	<p pid="b.431.3/11">would guard against risk weights underestimating the true riskiness of assets and provide a directly comparable figure across firms. Firms&#8217; leverage ratios were a useful indicator of failure during the last crisis, and the period immediately preceding the crisis was characterised by sharp increases in leverage. The Government strongly support the inclusion of a backstop leverage ratio in the EU prudential toolkit and consider it an essential measure to ensure that leverage remains at sustainable levels. It is clear that there is some way to go, but the review in 2017 will address that, and it will not be implemented across the EU until 2018, so we have some time to consider it.</p>

	<p pid="b.433.1/1">The discussions on those need to proceed separately&#8212;I think that the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill Committee will have some vigorous discussions&#8212;but the order relates solely to the sectoral requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.1/2">The Government will, of course, be able to add to the suite of macro-prudential tools in the future by further order, subject to the approval of this House and the other place. At the moment, we believe that the measures I have described are appropriate and sufficient starting points for the FPC. The Government expect the tool kit to adapt and evolve as the international debate and academic literature on the subject develops and empirical experience becomes more widely available. We expect the FPC to make recommendations to the Treasury if its macro-prudential measures require amendments or the addition of new measures is required. I hope that my explanation has been helpful.</p>

	<p pid="b.433.2/1">The jargon in this order may deter not just members of the public but&#8212;dare I say it?&#8212;hon. Members from rolling up their sleeves and getting involved in this debate. I contend, however, that, in layman&#8217;s turns, the order involves an incredibly important set of issues. We are talking about giving the regulators of the unelected Bank of England&#8217;s Financial Policy Committee incredible powers that will enable them to tell people the level of deposit required for their home loan purchase and, potentially at a moment&#8217;s notice, that minimum repayments on their credit cards will need to rise from, for example, 2% to 5%. They will also be able to tell businesses that loans and overdrafts that they may have already arranged with their banks are no longer feasible. We are talking about the significant potential impacts that macro-prudential policy making could have downstream on the economy and consumers. As we have said many times, although prudential regulatory theory is fine&#8212;it is difficult to disagree with the concept&#8212;the practical reality and serious questions about how it will work merit consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/2">We support the creation of the FPC at the Bank of England. An important lesson from the global financial crisis is that we need better systemic oversight, not just firm-by-firm regulation. We have to see the wood for the trees. However, as was said last year during the passage of the Financial Services Act 2012, questions linger about the FPC&#8217;s accountability and the rationale</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/3">behind the choices it will make. Asking very clever people to gaze into a crystal ball and predict the economic future is a big thing for Parliament to do. We are asking them to improve their foresight when most people find it easier to draw conclusions in hindsight. There is, therefore, a lot of responsibility on the shoulders of the Bank of England and, of course, this provides a perfect vehicle for it to be landed with the blame by politicians if things go wrong. Members of the FPC will no doubt be well aware of those responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/4">As the Minister has said, the order is relatively straightforward. It gives the Prudential Regulation Authority, which is an arm of the Bank of England, the power to make banks and investment firms increase their capital holdings&#8212;in other words, their additional own funds&#8212;in relation to their exposure to residential property, commercial property or the financial sector. It will also give the PRA the power to make those banks and investment firms treat exposures to other financial services companies, residential property or commercial property as riskier ventures than they might otherwise have done&#8212;in other words, to raise the risk weightings on those holdings.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/5">It was interesting to hear the Minister say that, after the consultation, the Government changed things so that the PRA-regulated firms would be those that are systemically important. That throws up a question that has just occurred to me. I had assumed that all residential mortgage loans and commercial transactions would be affected by a turn of the dial by the FPC. As it turns out, the Minister is saying that only transactions undertaken by systemically important organisations or the larger banks will be affected. Will he tell the House what proportion of residential and commercial transactions will not be affected if the FPC decides to adjust the availability of finance in those sectors or the capital requirements affecting those sectors? I assume that the vast majority of the firms in those markets are systemically important, but it would be interesting if the Minister gave a breakdown. If he cannot tonight, I would be happy if his team wrote to me on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/6">There are other macro-prudential tools. The Minister mentioned the counter-cyclical capital buffer. That is part of the Basel III requirements which will be implemented through European directives and so forth. I want to ask him about some of the other macro-prudential tools that were discussed in a long document by the FPC.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/7">I am pretty sure that the Minister is saying that, by and large, the sectoral capital requirements are those that are dealt with in the order, but I am not entirely clear about that. If one wanted to be very theoretical about macro-prudential policy, one could argue that history shows, whether through the South Sea bubble or the tulip boom, what has happened to various sectors that nobody predicted would become overheated. I do not necessarily see all sectors coming under the potential purview of the FPC. I assume that the Government would simply vest the FPC with other sectoral issues if they felt that there were emerging pressures or credit bubbles in other sectors. It does not seem that the Minister is today allowing the FPC to intervene across the whole landscape.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">The hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>, who chairs the Treasury Committee, rightly asked about the leverage ratio. I am surprised that the Minister wants to wait until 2018 for that. He says that he hopes there will not be slippage, but he has been around the European</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/9">policy-making circuit for long enough to realise that a commitment to do something in 2018 means that it may well not materialise until 2022 or even later. One just has to look at the solvency II discussions, which seem to be generational. I regret that the Government seem reluctant to take a British approach to regulating on the leverage ratio. I do not think that we should simply wait for Europe to determine such matters for us. It would be better if the Minister gave a commitment that he would at least consider including in the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill the recommendations of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards on giving the FPC the right to get into some of the leverage ratio questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/10">I have a number of other points that I want to ask the Minister about briefly. On the enforcement of prudential regulation, will he elaborate on the penalties or disciplinary steps that the regulator will have at its disposal if an investment firm or bank contravenes the imposed requirements of the FPC? If we have a body that is making policy, we must ask how it will be enforced. So far, a lot of the penalties in the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill seem to involve an individual seeking redress through the civil courts, which seems quite weak. What will happen if a bank steps across a line?</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/11">Members will recall the debate that we had during the passage of the Financial Services Act 2012 on the stability rules that the Government originally proposed to give to the Bank of England. They wanted to emphasise stability, which of course is vital, but they left out the importance of getting the economy growing and creating jobs, especially when times are tough or when there is a deflationary environment. Eventually, the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to relent and an amendment was inserted in the House of Lords to ensure that the FPC has regard to the economic objectives of Government policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/12">Are we in danger of repeating the same lopsidedness in the regulations, or of an asymmetrical approach to attempts to control the heat of the economy? The measures in the order specify that banks must hold &#8220;additional&#8221; funds if lending to households or businesses, with a view to slowing things down and taking the heat out of the economy. That, of course, is a necessary part of the toolkit, but what happens if things slow down too much and the economy needs more lending to businesses and households, or more inter-bank and financial services mutual investment? The order does not seem to contain corresponding or parallel powers to dial things down, relieve capital requirements or remove &#8220;additional own funds&#8221; provisions if they prove in retrospect to have gone too far. Is that a problem with the order? Should not the power be symmetrical? I would be grateful if the Minister would consider that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/13">On enforcement, are there dangers and risks of gaming in sectoral capital requirements? If we draw up operational targets that focus on the means rather than the ends, will the Minister assure the House that some of the specific requirements on residential or commercial investment cannot be evaded by twisting definitions, deliberate misinterpretation or gaming? I gather that that point came up at the Treasury Committee last year and there are important concerns.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/14">Will the Minister update the House on the latest information about who will make decisions on the loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios on mortgages? There was a bit of pass the parcel between the FPC Committee and the Treasury last year when it came to mortgage regulation. The Treasury wanted the Bank of England to do the deed, but the Bank said it was a political decision and wanted Ministers to make decisions restricting LTV ratios. Will the Minister say where things currently stand, because such things do matter? As Adrian Coles from the Building Societies Association has rightly said, a change to the loan-to-value ratio may not matter much to those wanting to get a foot on the property ladder who have already got access to deep pockets or the bank of mum and dad, as it is known, but rapid decisions to increase the amount of deposit a home buyer needs will hit the least well off in society. Who will decide those things&#8212;the Treasury or the FPC?</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/15">My final two points are on geographical regulation and business lending. Will the sectoral powers be available for the Bank of England to use area by area, region by region, and locality by locality? In other words, will the Bank be able, or is it seeking, to take heat out of certain geographical housing markets and not others? I do not advocate this, but if it so wished could the Bank use these powers to make it harder to buy a house in London than in Cornwall, or vice versa? Will the Minister clarify how specific&#8212;or area-specific&#8212;the Bank can be with these powers?</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/16">Lending to small and medium-sized enterprises has fallen off and is still doing so. The funding for lending scheme was supposed to change that but its rules are skewed towards residential lending rather than business lending. Is the order to be seen in parallel with that scheme, and can the scheme be reformed to favour business lending? Will the Chancellor consider those issues in the Budget?</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/17">Transparency and the openness of the FPC must be considered and many, including the Council of Mortgage Lenders, have said that we need proper analysis by the FPC about what it is doing and an explanation of why it is using its powers. A narrative requirement on the FPC is a reasonable request, so will the Minister explain why that is not in the order?</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/18">The Opposition support these general powers but we hope for refinements and improved accountability in the enactment of some of these tools. We want Parliament to have better scrutiny of these measures and for the Treasury to ensure that when the tools are granted, whether or not that is in the next wave or regulations or legislation, the Treasury Committee and others will have a better opportunity for proper oversight of how the Bank of England is exercising these considerable powers.</p>

	<p pid="b.436.0/1">I rise to put two points to the House. First, I object to the statutory instrument on a matter of principle, which I will outline. Secondly, I want to ask the Minister why he included residential property among the first prudential tools. Some of the tools make sense&#8212;including commercial, and, obviously, investment and financial services&#8212;but the residential property one does not.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.0/2">Specifically, I object to how we are dealing with discussion, debate and decisions on the macro-prudential tools. I have constantly raised the matter in the Treasury Committee and the Independent Commission on Banking, and I have raised it on the Floor of the House with the Chancellor. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> said, these can be seen as boring matters, but it is accepted that they could lead to decisions that affect the standard of living of many of our constituents; affect the future of industries such as the construction industry; and affect the economy. The decisions will be taken by non-elected individuals and tonight appears to be the House&#8217;s only opportunity to debate and challenge the measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.0/3">The matter is being dealt with by statutory instrument. In other words, we have 90 minutes to discuss the measures and cannot amend them. We can only vote against the whole measure if we disagree with it or feel strongly about any part of it. The measures are proposed by the Government. If Opposition Members have strong feelings, they have only one chance to influence the decision, and they must turn down the whole order. That is a nonsensical procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.0/4">I have raised the matter with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Chamber. He indicated that he understood the measure&#8217;s sensitivity and importance and that he had an open mind. He accepted that the usual channels would deal with it. I pay tribute to him for placing the order on the Chamber&#8217;s agenda rather than dealing with it upstairs in Committee in the normal way. That is a step forward. The FPC is made up of unelected individuals, but they set policy, so the statutory instrument is a pretty disgraceful way to deal with the matter. Statutory instruments and secondary legislation are not supposed to deal with policy or principle&#8212;they deal with measures that need to be adjusted as time passes. They are not a way to decide things of such importance.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.0/5">The Treasury Committee raised the matter with the Minister when they discussed macro-economics. He seemed to accept what we said and I have a quote if he challenges me. However, his approach to the question&#8212;sadly, because he is a well regarded Minister&#8212;was this: &#8220;We&#8217;ve appointed these individuals and should not second-guess them.&#8221; That is a recipe for disaster.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.0/6">The Treasury Committee yesterday heard evidence from the Monetary Policy Committee, including officers and non-executives from the Bank of England. It was a hairy meeting, because those individuals take decisions, but there was no sign that the battle of inflation is definitely winning the argument against the battle for growth. If we read the words of the former Chancellor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>, and see the present Chancellor, we can see the difficulty they have had in getting so-called independent bodies to accept the sensitivity of some of their decisions. It is an impossible task. The bodies shelter under their independence. Both Chancellors have experienced this, and if they want bodies to do something they feel is necessary, the issue of independence is thrown back in their face: &#8220;You gave us independence and therefore you should not interfere&#8221;. I am worried about this issue, which is why I am taking the opportunity to put it on the record.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.0/7">On residential matters, to which my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East referred, one of the macro-prudential tools discussed in the Financial Policy</p>
	<p pid="b.436.0/8">Committee and dropped was loan-to-value mortgages. Most of us were pleased when that was dropped, but it was a runner and was being discussed in Financial Services Authority circles for some 18 months. I am certain, from watching the industry, that that had a great effect on the industry&#8217;s decisions&#8212;it was trying to second-guess the FSA. The business of 90% and 80% mortgages had a devastating effect on individuals and couples who were trying to buy a house and begin family life. They were unable to take that step because the regulator was signalling to the regulated that they should be going in the direction of 90% and 80% at a time when the economy was dying for the construction industry to pick up and start building houses, which would have had a roll-on effect of people buying carpets, furniture, curtains and so on. The regulator was conditioning the decisions and behaviour of the regulated&#8212;it is that sensitive.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.0/9">On a higher level, we are going through this business with the Monetary Policy Committee. As someone said&#8212;maybe in a crowded House this might have an effect&#8212;when an individual or a couple cannot get a mortgage, they do not blame the building society. When the building societies say it is the Monetary Policy Committee, they come to see us and we say it is the Monetary Policy Committee. The ordinary person in the street will ask, &#8220;Who set up the Monetary Policy Committee? Who is it answerable to?&#8221; It is answerable to us, but it is not really answerable to us because there is no real opportunity to make things happen. A yearly remit from the Chancellor is hardly a procedure for democratic accountability, and we are prevented from dealing with these matters on the Floor of the House in order to indicate our displeasure and unhappiness. I see the Treasurer of Her Majesty&#8217;s Household, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40621" name="John Randall">the right hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Mr Randall)</phrase>, a very prominent member of the usual channels sitting in the Chamber. I hope he is listening to this debate and gets people to think about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.0/10">I want to ask the Minister why on earth residential property was placed in the initial order. This is 2013. The Minister is as anxious as I am&#8212;probably more than I am&#8212;to see houses being built and sold and the whole procedure started. There is no question of any systemic risk in the foreseeable future. Even when the problems were at their worst, there was no systemic risk, just an industry with problems. I accept that some banks that had over-extended on their loans had real problems. I accept the point about the commercial side and the likes of RBS and HBOS&#8212;it was on a greater scale and of greater concern than on the residential side&#8212;and the point about investment and financial houses. However, for the MPC to start worrying&#8212;in shades of the FSA&#8212;about systemic risk in the construction industry spreads unnecessary alarm.</p>

	<p pid="b.438.1/1">I see the Minister nodding. I am sure that he will explain, but that is the sort of thing I am talking about. If the loan-to-value ratio had been in this statutory instrument&#8212;if the interim FPC had stuck at it&#8212;I think this place would have been full and the Minister would have had little choice but to allow the thing through.

	<p pid="b.439.0/1">Let me respond to the points made by the hon. Members for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) and for Leeds East (Mr Mudie). They made some thoughtful points about the House&#8217;s ability to scrutinise the powers that will be available to the FPC, particularly those relating to residential mortgages. Their comments went to the heart of the dilemma behind the setting up of these institutions and powers. The purpose of macro-prudential policy is&#8212;to adopt the analogy often used&#8212;to take the punch bowl away from the party just when the guests are getting over-exuberant. For the first time, there will be a group of people with the explicit task of monitoring conditions and taking a considered view of what is in the interests of financial stability but which might not be at the forefront of the minds of the people participating, either as practitioners, commercial players or politicians.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/2">The hon. Member for Nottingham East acknowledged the consensus on the need to set up these institutions of macro-prudential policy, but that does not take away from the fact that their establishment is designed deliberately to introduce a necessary tension into the debates. The question arises, then, of whether these powers can be exercised appropriately&#8212;for example, whether the House has appropriate scrutiny and discretion over them.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.0/3">One reason why we have initially given the FPC a minimal&#8212;I think he will agree&#8212;set of powers through a statutory instrument being debated on the Floor of the House is that these things should be properly scrutinised. We timed this debate so that it could follow the hearing of the Treasury Select Committee, of which the hon. Member for Leeds East is a member and which has considered this matter in recent days. Our intention is that these things should be properly scrutinised and well considered. It is for the Government to bring forward proposals about what the tools should be. Future proposals will be put before the House, and Ministers will be accountable to the Committee and the House. Indeed, the statutory instrument is available for debate. As the hon. Members would acknowledge, we have not loaded it with so many different provisions as to give the House a Hobson&#8217;s choice.</p>

	<p pid="b.439.1/1">As a member of the Treasury Committee, I hear it said all the time that we have the ability to scrutinise, and that people are accountable to us. That carries little weight with me; it does not impress me. This is ultimately a question of who takes the decisions when a Minister or a Chancellor&#8212;such as the last Chancellor&#8212;going through a crisis meets an unelected Governor and asks him to do something in the interests of the economy and the future of the country, and the Governor says no. That is what we are talking about.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.439.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="439"  time="019:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227-0004.htm_spnew22">
	<p pid="b.439.2/1">Let me go on to describe some of the other elements involved. I said that we had committed to bringing to the House particular measures that could be debated. The hon. Gentleman has anticipated one</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/2">such possibility. He was correct in suggesting that, if we had been proposing a power over the loan-to-value rate, the House would have been substantially more occupied than it is at the moment, that such a matter would engage Members and that there would have been a fuller debate on the matter. However, this is not the only mechanism by which scrutiny can take place.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/3">The secondary objective of the Financial Policy Committee has been mentioned. Through the scrutiny of the House and of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Committee, that objective has been set up, and it means that the FPC&#8217;s duty to support the court of the Bank of England in achieving its financial stability objective is subject to supporting the policy of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government, including their objectives for growth and employment. That is significant. That power is there for a reason, and we expect it to be used. It requires the Chancellor of the day to write annually to the FPC to set out what he expects it to have regard to in making its decisions. The House will have the ability through that mechanism to scrutinise and take a view on whether Ministers&#8212;in this case, the Chancellor&#8212;are giving the right directions to the Committee in terms of what it should understand the Government&#8217;s economic objectives to be. I believe that the mention of growth and employment will address one of the concerns that has been raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/4">It is worth noting that the measures we are talking about relate to peacetime; they are not for use in a crisis. The Chancellor will retain the ability to give directions to the Bank in a time of financial crisis, for example, when that is in the public interest. The measures before us are for use in the normal course of events.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/5">There will also be a requirement on the FPC to account for its decisions. It will appear before the Treasury Committee after it has held its meetings and published its reports, and it will have to explain the basis of its recommendations and directions. It has made a commitment to setting out in advance the types of indicators that it will bring to bear on those questions, so there will be no arbitrary use of discretionary powers. The committee will seek to be predictable in regard to the types of instrument that it will use.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/6">On the format of statutory instruments, the parliamentary Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee will take a view on whether the choice of procedure is appropriate. I think that the hon. Gentleman will approve of the fact that the affirmative resolution procedure is to be used in these circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/7">Let me address the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about residential property, which is of course a matter of interest to our constituents. It has been pointed out that all these matters have a bearing on our constituents. I think he would acknowledge that any review of the recent financial crisis&#8212;and, indeed, of financial crises around the world&#8212;would note that housing bubbles are often associated with the kind of over-exuberance and excess that contributes to financial instability, which the arrangements that we have in place are designed to address. It is appropriate for the powers to be there. These sectors have been debated at the European level, and this is one of a limited number of sectors for which it is anticipated that the national regulators should have a sectoral power.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/8">I think it important to note that the power to make recommendations and give directions is available to the FPC, but that there is no requirement that it should get</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/9">in the business of micro-managing these sectors. It seems to make sense, on the basis of history, for this initial set of sectors to be included. The powers are there, as I say, but there has been some debate about whether they should be more specific in respect of loan-to-value powers, which is not part of the proposals. It is no part of the Government&#8217;s purpose, as the hon. Gentleman rightly anticipates, to prevent what we hope will be an increase in home ownership and house building as a result of the order.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/10">Let me deal with some points raised by the hon. Member for Nottingham East. He forcefully made the point that we need an explanation from the Financial Policy Committee of why it is using its powers. This should not take place in a vacuum or in secret. I completely agree, and this is provided for in the Financial Services Act, as the hon. Gentleman, a veteran of the Committee, knows. Section 95 requires the FPC to give an explanation of the reasons for its use of direction powers, and the explanation needs to be published in the financial stability report and it needs to account to Parliament for its use of the powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/11">Let me pick up one of the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s earlier points, which was not quite right. He mentioned credit card repayments, for example. The powers provided for in the statutory instrument do not go into that level of detail, and the FPC will not have those powers and they are certainly not in this order&#8212;and neither are the loan-to-value powers available.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.2/12">The secondary objective addresses the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point about the necessary symmetry of these arrangements. Macro-prudential regulation is certainly about damping down excessive exuberance when it takes place, but on the other side of the cycle, by retreating from some of the provisions by varying requirements downwards, it also has the power to reverse the dampening of those sectors.</p>

	<p pid="b.441.0/1">I am sorry, but as I read the order, I note that it says that UK firms can be required to maintain &#8220;additional&#8221; funds, but there seems to be no provision to dial it down the other way. Have I misread the order?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.441.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="441"  time="019:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227-0004.htm_spnew24">
	<p pid="b.441.1/1">What I am referring to is the fact that if the requirements have been dialled up, they can be dialled down. That will be required. The fact that they are time varying precisely reflects the different conditions that will apply from time to time.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.1/2">The hon. Gentleman mentioned the exemption for small firms, and he was quite right to raise the issue of what proportion of mortgages might be covered. To be clear&#8212; when he sees my remarks, he will be clear&#8212;the exemption applies to small investment firms. It is still the case that all deposit takers and banks, including building societies, will be within the scope of the power. That contribution will be recognised.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.1/3">As to whether we should take the power&#8212;either through the order or, more likely, through the Banking Reform Bill or previous legislation on the leverage ratio, which is a live issue&#8212;it is already possible by order under the Financial Services Act to make provisions to vary the leverage ratio. Such an order would, of course, be subject to prior parliamentary approval. There is no requirement for additional primary legislation; the powers will be there at the time we expect to bring the provisions into force.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.1/4">The hon. Gentleman asked about the penalties for contravening the views of the Financial Policy Committee. The committee makes recommendations to the regulators, and it is the regulators&#8212;the PRA and the FCA&#8212;who are responsible for implementing them. The hon. Gentleman will know&#8212;again, from the Financial Services Act&#8212;that considerable powers are available to the FCA and the PRA, in the form of regulatory sanctions, constrictions on firms&#8217; activities, and unlimited fines. That is why the sector regulators have the powers of direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.1/5">The hon. Gentleman raised a geographical point, asking whether the sectoral powers could be used to specify a particular area. The answer is that they could, if there were evidence of a particular problem in a particular area. However, as he will recall, there is a general requirement for the FPC to act proportionately, and one of the principles that has been agreed is that it should not become involved in the micro-management of these matters or in close detail. I consider it unlikely that it would make recommendations on a narrow geographical basis.</p>
	<p pid="b.441.1/6">I hope that I have responded adequately to the points that have been made this evening. I gather from the Whips that I may have done so to the satisfaction of the House, and I hope that it will agree to the recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="b.444.2/1">You can rest easy now, Mr Deputy Speaker. After all that gobbledegook about Basel III and socially dubious uses of money, we can return to the subject of the real economy. It is a great privilege to have secured this important Adjournment debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/2">The issue of countries of origin and the right of consumers to know where goods, foods and materials emanate from is particularly important at present, as we battle with the ongoing horsemeat crisis. Indeed, that scandal is a textbook example of the need for clarity of information on sourcing, but what my colleagues and I wish to address this evening is origin marking in the ceramics industry, and especially the issue of what we call bogus back-stamping&#8212;the misleading allocation of country of origin details, designed to confuse the consumer.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/3">It is said that we can always recognise a Stokie by their feverish examination of the back-stamp on any cup, saucer, plate or bowl. I am talking about the celebrated &#8220;turnover club&#8221;, as the plate is whisked over to examine the mark of origin&#8212;although I must add that there are some etiquette issues as to when we can do that when eating out.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/4">I am glad to say that we have some excellent Stoke ware here in the Palace of Westminster. We have Wedgwood plates, some fine Dudson cups&#8212;from the constituency of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40582" name="Joan Walley">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan Walley)</phrase>&#8212;and if you were to join me for a cup of tea in my office, Mr Deputy Speaker, you would find some beautiful Emma Bridgewater mugs and Portmeirion cups and saucers.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/5">It is a source of great pride to our constituents that pottery has been thrown in Stoke-on-Trent since the late-1500s. Out of the blue and yellow North Staffs clay came butter pots and flowerpots. In the sun kilns of Bagnall and Penkhull, local artisans started to glaze their earthenware and develop a reputation for craftsmanship. In their wake came the great houses of Wedgwood, Spode, Royal Doulton and Minton, names celebrated around the world for the excellence of their craftsmanship. Stoke-on-Trent gained the title &#8220;The Potteries&#8221; as &#8220;Made in Staffordshire&#8221; became a global hallmark of excellence.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/6">When J. B. Priestley visited Stoke-on-Trent in the mid-1930s, he was taken aback by the beauty of the bottle kilns. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/7">&#8220;They represent the very heart and soul of the district&#8230;unless you are prepared to take a deep and lasting interest in what happens inside those ovens, it would be better for you to take the first train anywhere.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/8">Today, we make a lot of other stuff in Stoke, but the good news is that, after decades of decline, the pottery industry is roaring back to life: investment is up; orders are coming in; the kilns are alight; jobs are coming back from the far east; and we are all looking forward&#8212;as is the entire nation&#8212;to a successful royal birth this summer, with attendant ceramic sales. The key to success is the quality of our artists and designers, the new plant and</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/9">equipment, and the artisan skills of the work force, which means it is more important than ever that consumers are able clearly to know what they are buying.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/10">This is the problem we face: if a mug is made in Indonesia or Thailand, it can be transported into the UK and then have the word &#8220;England&#8221; stamped on the bottom of it. Similarly, if a mug is made in Vietnam or Turkey and then finished in England, it can have &#8220;Made in England&#8221; or &#8220;Made in Britain&#8221; stamped on the bottom. That is what we call bogus back-stamping&#8212;the wrongful attribution of country of origin labelling&#8212;and it is harming jobs and investment in the UK, and especially in Stoke-on-Trent. More than that, morally, it is trading off the skills, sweat and application of generations of Stoke-on-Trent workers, who turned the &#8220;Made in Staffordshire&#8221; brand into a world-class mark of excellence.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/11">I have no problem with goods being made abroad and finished in the UK. This is not about protectionism. In a globalised marketplace, the supply chain will often cover many different continents. Many hundreds of jobs in the ceramics industry involve production abroad and finishing in the UK, and the companies concerned are often good firms that do the right thing. However, what I and my colleagues do have a problem with is goods that are made abroad being classed as being made in Staffordshire or Stoke-on-Trent, when they are not.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/12">The rules are very clear. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, European Union directive 2025/73 states that it is the so-called &#8221;blank&#8221;&#8212;where the first firing of the ceramics takes place&#8212;that determines the origin of the ware, irrespective of subsequent processes, such as finishing, decorating or glazing. It is about the first firing, and if that takes place in Jakarta, the product is Indonesian-made and should not have &#8220;England&#8221; stamped on the bottom.</p>
	<p pid="b.444.2/13">For years, UK Governments of both parties&#8212;of all parties now&#8212;have opposed the compulsory indication of the country of origin of goods. Lord Mandelson attempted to introduce such a scheme in 2005 when he was the European Union Trade Commissioner, whereby there would be mandatory country of origin marking on certain products imported from third countries.</p>

	<p pid="b.446.2/2">The attempt to introduce mandatory country of origin marking has not worked.

	<p pid="b.446.3/1">It is so important, particularly for the work force in Stoke-on-Trent, that we get some response from the Minister tonight. Does my hon. Friend agree that the real issue is that when people buy ceramics they want to be in a position to make an informed choice? Therefore, labelling is really important, as are the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. If we are not going to go down the route of further legislation, we need proper enforcement, particularly by trading standards officers. We have seen a lack of trading standards officers because of the cuts to local government, so will the Minister therefore assure the House that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will give a real lead on requiring trading standards officers to take action on this issue of bogus back-stamping?</p>

	<p pid="b.446.4/1">My hon. Friend has been fighting for the ceramics industry for far longer than I have, and her achievements with Steelite, Middleport and Royal Stafford are known throughout Stoke-on-Trent. She rightly makes the case that this is about consumer rights; it is about consumers knowing that when they buy wares that are &#8220;made in Stoke-on-Trent&#8221; and &#8220;made in Staffordshire&#8221;&#8212;the finest in the world&#8212; those goods have an authenticity about where they are made.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.4/2">In the last debate the House had on this issue, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40553" name="Gavin Williamson">the hon. Member for South Staffordshire (Gavin Williamson)</phrase>, who is not in his place but who has a history of working in the ceramics industry, asked what country a plate made by his fictitious company &#8220;Gavin Williamson English Chinaware&#8221; might be made in. What he illustrated was just how ambiguous the current framework is when the history and tradition of English or British manufacturing is integral to the branding of certain products, whether they are actually manufactured here or not.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.4/3">The potters are proud of their history and consumers want to be sure that they are purchasing the true heirs to 300 years of craftsmanship. Of course, back stamping is not a legal requirement and the absence of a back stamp usually tells us as much about an item&#8217;s origins as a stamp does. However, if a back stamp or any product labelling is applied, the Trade Descriptions Act 1968 requires these marks to be accurate indications of the</p>
	<p pid="b.446.4/4">&#8220;place of manufacture, production, processing or reconditioning&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.4/5">of the goods. That is where bogus back stamping comes in, undermining the &#8220;Made in Stoke-on-Trent&#8221; brand and misleading consumers. The onus lies with the trading standards authorities to weed out that practise.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.4/6">Too often, Business Ministers have listened to the big retail chains and superstores as they demand cheap goods at any price and claim that any attempt to inform the consumer is protectionism. Well, it is not. It is about transparency and rebalancing the British economy; it is about honesty for the consumer, and a decent industrial strategy for the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.4/7">My initial ask of the Minister is for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to allocate some funding to secure protection for this nationally important sector, as it has for other sectors under the Trading Standards Institute&#8212;most notably and recently the money-lending industry. Secondly, I ask her to write to the Office of Fair Trading to ask it to take a close look at the issue and report to Parliament on how it is seeking to protect the branding and property rights of UK ceramics companies. I also ask her to lead by example. There are mugs in BIS with no back stamp, there are plates in British embassies that are made in Thailand, and I have found in august institutions such as the Royal Society and the Imperial War museum ceramics bedecked in the imagery of Britain but imported from abroad. If Business Ministers are serious about supporting the march of the makers, they could begin with Government procurement policy.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.4/8">My hon. Friends and I are seeking from this debate a commitment from the Government to take bogus back stamping seriously; to allocate time and attention to the question; to explain to the OFT and trading standards authorities that this is a priority issue and that they have the resources to deal with it; and to support our great ceramics industry through a detailed procurement process. If the Minister does all that, my hon. Friends and I might just think about welcoming her into the &#8220;turnover club&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="b.447.0/1">I am delighted to respond to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40581" name="Tristram Hunt">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt)</phrase> and I congratulate him not only on securing a debate on an issue that is very important for his constituency but on the passionate and humorous way in which he managed to convey the issues with a great degree of eloquence. He spoke from the heart about the importance of this fine industry and the role it can play in our nation&#8217;s heritage and our nation&#8217;s future.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.0/2">It is not surprising, given that the hon. Gentleman represents the potteries area, that the ceramics industry was uppermost in his speech. Of course, it is a UK</p>
	<p pid="b.447.0/3">sector with a well-deserved worldwide reputation for the design and quality of its products. I can attest to that, as I was delighted to receive some when I got married two years ago. Such china makes a very fine wedding present, I must say.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.0/4">Like the hon. Gentleman, the coalition Government are rightly proud of British manufacturing. I am delighted to hear the success stories of the potteries industry and, in particular, the recent improvements that mean that things are going very much in the right direction. We are clear that we want to secure and drive through growth, proclaiming what is made in Britain, invented in Britain and designed in Britain. The Department has championed that through the &#8220;Britain is Great&#8221; campaign and it is important that we champion the merits of our industries, which create so much fine produce in manufacturing.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.0/5">I know that the hon. Gentleman and the other MPs from the Stoke area have recently had separate meetings with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and the Minister for Trade and Investment in the other place, Lord Green, to raise the issue of misleading origin marking. I hope those meetings reassured the hon. Gentleman to some degree that the Government take information for consumers seriously. Both the Secretary of State and Lord Green will write to him soon on this and other issues that he raised with them.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.0/6">I agree that there is a place for country of origin labelling&#8212;that is, for positive country of origin marking, done because UK manufacturers think that is the right thing to do for themselves and for their customers. I would argue that legislation is not needed beyond the existing protections against counterfeiting and false advertisement, but that it can be done voluntarily. Of course many UK producers already do so because the companies rightly perceive a marketing benefit in being able to show that stamp of quality&#8212;hence the &#8220;turnover club&#8221;. The Government have consistently supported the use of voluntary country of origin marking, but we are cautious about adopting a legislative approach to origin labelling of manufactured goods.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.0/7">The House will be aware of the Government&#8217;s concern that poorly designed regulation can be unnecessarily burdensome and complex, and duplicate requirements in other regulations, which can impose excessive and unnecessary costs on business. Introducing the debate, the hon. Gentleman stood up for businesses, so I am sure that he does not want them to face unnecessary costs either. We are trying to eliminate avoidable burdens of regulation and bureaucracy, so we will consider introducing new regulation only as the last resort. Overall, our aim is to reduce the amount of regulation, and that includes a commitment to improving and reducing the burdens imposed by European legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.0/8">That means we have to explore thoroughly alternatives to legislation, and in this case, I would argue that the alternative is voluntary labelling. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40582" name="Joan Walley">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan Walley)</phrase> asked whether, if the legislative route is not to be adopted, voluntary labelling can be properly enforced. She is right to highlight the key importance of enforcement. It is important to make it clear that because of rulings by the European Court of Justice and our single market obligations, the UK cannot unilaterally impose compulsory &#8220;Made in Britain&#8221; labelling, even if we wanted to; nor can we impose origin marking unilaterally on imports, because that would be contrary to our single market obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.0/9">Business can of course label if it wants, but that does not mean that such labelling is unregulated. Labelling has to be clear, accurate and not misleading to the consumer. The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central said he had a problem with claims that goods are made in Staffordshire or Stoke-on-Trent when they are not, and I wholeheartedly agree with him. Under current consumer protection regulations, it is a criminal offence to present false information and deliberately mislead consumers. The key test is whether the information encourages consumers to make a purchasing choice that they would otherwise not have made, and it includes misleading or false information on the origin of goods, however it is provided. That law exists.</p>
	<p pid="b.447.0/10">The hon. Gentleman mentioned European Union directive 2025/73 and talked about origin being defined by where the initial firing takes place. That directive deals with the tariff treatment of ceramics and is therefore not strictly relevant to the Court&#8217;s judgment on consumer issues, where the key test is whether the consumer&#8217;s behaviour is affected. If it were deemed not to affect the consumer&#8217;s purchasing decisions, the information being wrong would not be deemed to be misleading.</p>

	<p pid="b.449.0/1">Let us imagine someone going to buy a wedding present of china: does the Minister not accept that if the impression is given that the china was made in this country and it has all the attributes of pottery made in Stoke-on-Trent, but in fact the blank was manufactured abroad, it cannot be accurately described as manufactured in this country? That is the misleading aspect. It is similar to the situation my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40581" name="Tristram Hunt">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt)</phrase> described involving beefburgers and horsemeat. In the remaining time, will the Minister stress how we can deal with disingenuous attempts to relabel an item as something other than what it actually is?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.449.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40225" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="449"  time="020:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227-0004.htm_spnew40">
	<p pid="b.449.1/1">I will certainly endeavour to do so, because ensuring that existing provisions in law can be used is key to the question that the hon. Lady raises. The issue has not yet been tested in the courts in relation to origin markings. It is a broad concept, but the basic rule is that if consumers are likely to be misled in their purchasing decision, an offence is likely to have been committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.1/2">Without commenting on specific examples, let me say that it is up to the enforcement authorities to consider whether there is any evidence of possible offences, and then it is for the courts to decide. The protection is not just for consumers&#8212;as in the example of gift buying outlined by the hon. Lady&#8212;but serves to ensure a level playing field for businesses that are honest and that give accurate information, so that they are not disadvantaged in relation to businesses that engage in deceptive practices. Local authority trading standards officers and the Office of Fair Trading are the relevant enforcement authorities in such a circumstance. The OFT&#8217;s role usually relates to matters affecting the general interests of consumers, rather than specific complaints, which are dealt with by trading standards officers. I encourage Members to ensure that any evidence of possible offences is brought to the attention of the relevant local authority, as has been alluded to.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.1/3">Trading standards officers are, of course, answerable to their local authority and to local councillors. It is not the Government&#8217;s role to set local priorities for local</p>
	<p pid="b.449.1/4">enforcement activities, as they rightly depend on the issues arising in each area, and inevitably they will vary from authority to authority. In setting their priorities, however, local authorities must take into account the potential impact of particular behaviour not just on local consumers but on the wider well-being of the community, including the business community. Where local authority powers can be used to address matters that are having an adverse impact on a local economy with a particular concentration of businesses, it is reasonable for those matters to achieve the priority that they merit in that area.</p>

	<p pid="b.450.0/1">The Minister is making an informative speech. Does a case need to come to trading standards officers to encourage them to act, or can Members of Parliament, for example, make a generalised request to them to look into a specific sectoral complaint?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-02-27b.450.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40225" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="450"  time="020:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm130227/debtext/130227-0004.htm#130227-0004.htm_spnew42">
	<p pid="b.450.1/1">Clearly, trading standards can look where there is evidence, or where they perceive that there might be evidence of a breach. I am sure that specific cases would greatly assist them in making their inquiries more fruitful more quickly. I encourage hon. Members to speak to their local trading standards teams. I know that the council in Stoke-on-Trent is run by the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s Labour colleagues, who, I am sure, will be willing to listen attentively to his representations on the matter. I urge him to take up the matter with them, as they have powers to deal with misleading information that encourages consumers to make a different decision on product purchases. Although part of the problem is that that has not been tested, I wholeheartedly encourage the taking forward of such matters. Given the various ways that Members have of raising matters in the House, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will not let the matter rest if he does not get satisfaction through that route.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.1/2">On the issue of the misleading of consumers, it is important to understand what matters to the consumer. In a Eurobarometer survey in autumn 2010, 75% of people questioned said that origin did not affect their purchasing of textiles and clothing; for electronic products, the figure was 68%. I am not sure whether ceramics were included in that study. We need to be clear about how consumers prioritise different pieces of information in their buying behaviour: price, design, brand name and origin. In making any purchasing decision, consumers will consider a variety of such factors. Of course, it is true that some consumers are very concerned to ensure that they support British or locally made products and will want information on their origin.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.1/3">I will turn briefly to the European Commission&#8217;s 2005 proposal for a regulation on compulsory labelling of imported consumer products. The Commission intends to withdraw the proposal, as I am sure the hon. Gentleman will be aware. I know that the UK&#8217;s ceramics sector has been a consistent supporter, but the Government have strong reservations, as was outlined in the Adjournment debate secured by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40553" name="Gavin Williamson">the Member for South Staffordshire (Gavin Williamson)</phrase> in 2011, which other hon. Members have referred to and, indeed, participated in.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.1/4">The reason the Commission gave for withdrawing the proposal was the lack of agreement in the Council and developments in the interpretation of World</p>
	<p pid="b.450.1/5">Trade Organisation rules that make it outdated. We expect confirmation on that in April. The proposal received a mixed response from member states. Many saw it primarily as a protectionist measure that discriminated between imported and EU-produced goods. Consumer information is important, but we do not necessarily want to go down a protectionist route.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.1/6">The Government obviously share the concerns about the need to tackle counterfeit goods and provide accurate information and the genuine concerns about trademark and design breaches and the mislabelling of imported goods from some sources, as the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central has outlined, but it did not seem that the Commission&#8217;s proposal would add anything to the debate except additional administrative and cost burdens, so it is right that it is likely to be withdrawn. There was also a customs issue relating to the cost that would be imposed, particularly in the context of the public expenditure constraints we face. If that is not the best way to achieve the outcome the hon. Gentleman wants, which is to allow companies in his constituency a level playing field and enable consumers to be well informed, alternatives such as the ones I have talked about and better enforcement are a better way forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.1/7">I will turn to the specific questions the hon. Gentleman asked towards the end of his remarks. He asked what funding the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills might be able to bring forward. The Department does not fund individual enforcement actions, but it does fund the National Trading Standards Board. As he might be aware, the trading standards landscape has been changing, because there were concerns that trading standards were too dispersed. The board will have greater power. We can bring the issue to the attention of the Office of Fair Trading, but it is up to it to consider whether an investigation is merited.</p>
	<p pid="b.450.1/8">With regard to the &#8220;turnover club&#8221; and the mugs in the Department with no back-stamp, I must say that I brought my own mug to the Department when I arrived. It commemorated the suffragettes and I enjoy drinking my tea from it. I have never turned it upside down to see what stamp is on it, but I will do so, although not when it is full of tea&#8212;as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, it is not always an appropriate moment to do that. I was intrigued to hear about the &#8220;turnover club&#8221; and will endeavour to take up his challenge to see where the goods in the Department come from and pass on his concerns to others.</p>
