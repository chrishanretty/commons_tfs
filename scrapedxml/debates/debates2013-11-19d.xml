On the other point, this is not a plan to import an endless series of political advisers. It is about recognising something that a number of independent think-tanks and others have recommended to the Government, which is to allow Ministers access to external policy expertise, which is sometimes lacking in Whitehall in the offices Ministers find themselves in.</p>

Part of the transition is to ensure the integrity of the electoral register and to make sure that electoral registration officers target the accuracy, as well as the completeness, of the register.

	<p pid="d.1072.3/1">The Government have been rebuked by the UK Statistics Authority, the Office for Budget Responsibility and others for misleading statements by Ministers on welfare, economic, health and education policy.

	<p pid="d.1072.4/1">It is incumbent on everybody on both sides of the House to make sure that the statistics we use, much as we might challenge them, are based in objective fact. However, on the day that the Labour party is literally making it up about child care costs and has been shown overnight to be using misleading statistics, and on the day when it claims that it will pay for new child care policies with a bank bonus tax that it has already spent 10 times over, I suggest that the hon.

	<p pid="d.1072.6/2">My right hon.

She must stop peddling these misleading statistics about the closure of Sure Start centres. She is also wrong about costs.

	<p pid="d.1073.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s answer is not even consistent with the Government&#8217;s own figures on Sure Start children&#8217;s centres. More importantly, it is not consistent with the experience of people in their own communities and of hard-working parents who have seen not only children&#8217;s centres close, but those remaining having their hours cut, their staff cut and their services cut. Nobody is going to be impressed by his posing as the champion of child care. The truth is that after all the progress on child care when we were in government, working parents are now finding it even harder to get the child care they need.</p>

This Government are providing a new entitlement for two-year-olds from the poorest families, which did not happen under 13 years of Labour. I have to say that so many of these difficult decisions are related to the fact that Opposition Members crashed the economy in the first place, for which they have taken no responsibility. Even the mayor of Toronto is admitting past mistakes.</p>

All we are saying&#8212;one would have thought that the hon.

Under our current rules, we would see big money spending more in constituencies than political parties can.

Friend knows, we are considering having up to 20 city deals if we can cross all the t&#8217;s and dot all the i&#8217;s. There is a willingness across the coalition Government to ensure that when local areas, local authorities and local enterprise partnerships say to us that they would like to draw down powers that are hoarded in Whitehall, our answer is yes, unless there are clear reasons why it should not happen.

	<p pid="d.1074.4/1">The hon. Lady will know that as we introduce universal credit and sweep aside the pernicious old rules, such as the 16-hour rule, that prevented people from accessing help with their child care costs, we are ensuring that there is support for those on universal credit to cover the vast bulk of their child care costs. We have made a number of announcements about that.</p>
	<p pid="d.1074.4/2">Even though we have had to make dramatic savings over the past few years, we should be judged by our actions. We have put more money into the universal provision of 15 hours&#8217; pre-school support for all three and four-year-olds, more money into provision for two-year-olds from the most deprived backgrounds and more money into the education of children from the most deprived backgrounds through the pupil premium. Alan Milburn&#8217;s report shows that, particularly through the effective use of the pupil premium, we are finally starting to close the attainment gap that has blighted our society for far too long.</p>

The Prime Minister and I were in Wales the week before last to announce that process and it has been universally welcomed by all parties in Wales. That comes in the context of the debate about the future of the United Kingdom and Scotland&#8217;s place within it.

	<p pid="d.1080.0/1">One hundred and fifty years ago today, President Abraham Lincoln delivered the Gettysburg Address. In that short speech, honest Abe declared a new birth of freedom. In Britain and the rest of the world, no single law does more to protect our freedom than the Human Rights Act. Will my right hon. and learned Friend honour Lincoln&#8217;s call by reaffirming our support for the Human Rights Act, which underpins our freedoms today?</p>

	<p pid="d.1087.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for giving the House an opportunity to consider the AB case, which we all noted last week, and which gained considerable publicity. I think it would be helpful for me to set out the position.</p>
	<p pid="d.1087.2/2">The claimant in that case raised the EU&#8217;s charter of fundamental rights when arguing that UK officials should not have allowed information about him to pass to the authorities of the country to which he was being removed. The case was dismissed on its facts but the judge in passing made some comments on the charter and the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg. The judge&#8217;s view was that the Luxembourg court had, in the case of NS, held that the charter could create new rights that apply in the UK. It is important to be very clear to the House: we do not agree with that analysis of the NS case. We intend to find another case&#8212;we cannot do it with this one as the Home Office was successful and we cannot appeal a case we have won&#8212;at the earliest opportunity to clarify beyond doubt the legal effects of the charter and to put the record straight.</p>
	<p pid="d.1087.2/3">It is no secret in this House that I would not personally have chosen to sign up to the Lisbon treaty or to the charter of fundamental rights. However, it is also important to say that the charter&#8217;s effects are limited to EU law within the UK, and I have not seen any evidence that it goes beyond that. I would be very concerned if there was any suggestion that the charter did in fact create new rights.</p>
	<p pid="d.1087.2/4">This is an important area, which is why this Government have included the extent of the EU&#8217;s competence on fundamental rights in our balance of competences review.</p>

	<p pid="d.1087.3/1">Does my right hon. Friend acknowledge the scale of the problem with which he is now faced, both constitutionally and practically, which would lead to the bypassing of the Government&#8217;s proposals for a British Bill of Rights and the repeal of the Human Rights Act, a policy that I established when I was shadow Attorney-General and which lasted until the coalition Government came to office? Does he appreciate that the import of Mr Justice Mostyn&#8217;s ruling opens the floodgates to a tidal wave of charter-based legal action, at enormous cost to the British taxpayer and businesses, and raises a fundamental clash between Westminster supremacy and the claims of the EU and the ECJ in respect of sections 2 and 3 of the European Communities Act 1972 that goes beyond mere renegotiation? Does he on behalf of the Government recognise that the amendments I tabled to the Lisbon Act&#8212;the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008&#8212;which the then Government voted against and the then official Opposition and the Lib Dems would not support, although</p>
	<p pid="d.1087.3/2">48 Conservative colleagues did vote for them, would have put our exclusion from the charter beyond any doubt? Will he therefore agree to support my proposal for urgent legislation as follows: &#8220;Notwithstanding any provision of the European Communities Act 1972, nothing in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union shall be binding in any legal proceedings of the United Kingdom and shall not form part of the law applicable in any part of the United Kingdom and that this Act reaffirms the supremacy of the United Kingdom Parliament&#8221;?</p>

	<p pid="d.1088.0/1">May I start by paying tribute to my hon. Friend for the work he has done in this House over the years in highlighting the complexities and challenges of EU law? He is a valuable contributor to these debates and we listen to him carefully. I have both listened to what he has said and I have taken extensive legal advice about the case last week. I think it is of fundamental importance that the impact of the charter in the United Kingdom is limited. We were made various promises about even that degree of involvement over the years, but we were not in power at that time. It is absolutely essential that it is limited in scope in the UK. I would treat it as a matter of the utmost seriousness if it were to emerge in law that that was no longer the case and that the charter was more broadly applicable than that.</p>
	<p pid="d.1088.0/2">I have to say that there are those in the European institutions who argue that it should have a broader impact than that, but I can provide some reassurance to my hon. Friend by saying that I was involved in such a discussion recently at a meeting in Brussels where the overwhelming view of member states present was that they did not wish it to have a broader remit than it does at the moment, and I say to him that we would treat any such situation with great seriousness. We do intend to make sure this issue is laid to rest in law at the earliest opportunity and, as always, I will be delighted to talk to him about his suggestions and about his concerns in this area.</p>

	<p pid="d.1088.3/1">I commend the Justice Secretary for the cool, calm way in which he answered these questions today, in contrast to the way in which he spoke to the media about the case last week. The position is clear: in 2007, Britain specifically opted out of the charter of fundamental rights being enforceable when the Lisbon treaty was signed. There is no ambiguity about that, as even Mr Justice Mostyn agrees. In his judgment, after quoting the relevant protocol, he said:</p>
	<p pid="d.1088.3/2">&#8220;To my mind, it is absolutely clear that the contracting parties agreed that the Charter did not create one single further justiciable right in our domestic courts.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1088.3/3">Labour sought and successfully negotiated an opt-out from the charter. I commend the cool, calm way in which the right hon. Gentleman has explained the timeline and the judgment in 2011.</p>

	<p pid="d.1088.3/5">that could cause in the judiciary. Will he publish the relevant legal advice so that all members of the judiciary can be made aware that there is no confusion, and that the charter is not enforceable in the UK courts? Will he also confirm that he understands that the concern relates to a ruling by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg, which arbitrates on matters relating to the EU, and not by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, which deals with the European convention on human rights? For the avoidance of doubt, I am willing to work with the right hon. Gentleman to ensure that the UK&#8217;s opt-out from the EU charter of fundamental rights, which we negotiated, remains in place?</p>

	<p pid="d.1089.0/1">With apologies to the House, I am not prepared to take any lessons from Labour Members who landed us with a treaty and a charter that did far more than we were promised. I also apologise to the former Europe Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40358" name="Keith Vaz">the right hon.

Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan)</phrase> talks about an opt-out, but that is not what the Labour Government actually negotiated. They negotiated a protocol that stated that the charter would be applied only to EU law. That is the situation today, and it does not enable us to opt out of the charter. We are still subject to it in EU matters. Again, that is not what Labour said would be the case.</p>
	<p pid="d.1089.0/4">The right hon. Gentleman asked me to publish the legal advice. His party has a long track record of not publishing legal advice. As he knows, Governments have always resisted its publication, and that will continue, because it is an important part of a Minister&#8217;s job to be able to take advice in confidence from our Law Officers. He also made a point about the European Court of Human Rights. The truth is that we need change in both areas. We need change in our relationship with the European Union and in our relationship with the European Court of Human Rights. They are separate institutions, and we need change in both of them. A majority Conservative Government would deliver those changes.</p>

Nobody was duped; the wording makes it absolutely clear that the charter does not extend the ability of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg or any other court, so far as British rights and duties are concerned.

That case&#8212;this remains the view of my Department&#8212;did not restate the legal position. The right hon. Gentleman is right about the protocol, which says that the charter applies to EU law and not to national law. Unfortunately, as we know, the Lisbon treaty is so vaguely worded in many respects that actually it allows the EU institutions to intrude in areas, such as social security, for example, that were expressly not envisioned in the treaty itself.</p>

In a unanimous report by the European Scrutiny Committee at the time, it was accepted, including by the Conservative Members, that the protocol allowed the UK to opt out of the charter of fundamental rights. It is not correct, when we are dealing with such difficult matters, to use this in a cheap political way, which he is doing.</p>

	<p pid="d.1091.4/1">I do not really recognise the comments of the hon. Gentleman. The reality is that we have a protocol that simply restates the legal position that European law and the charter of fundamental rights sit together and the charter does not apply in UK law. However, what we have seen over the past two or three years, in areas such as social security, is what we understood to be the scope of the treaty being extended by court judgments. We have to be immensely wary of that. It has happened in social security, it has happened in a way that causes real concerns across this House and we have to be very careful. I am absolutely clear that the</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-19d.1095.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40561" speakername="Jeremy Hunt" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Health"  colnum="1095"  time="012:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0001.htm#131119-0001.htm_spmin62">
	<p pid="d.1095.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement about the Government&#8217;s response to the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust public inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/2">Let me start by paying tribute to the men and women of courage, without whom this darkest episode in the history of the NHS would never have come to light. I am talking about people such as Julie Bailey and members of Cure the NHS, who stood outside the Department of Health in all weathers because no one would meet them to hear about the inhumane care given to their loved ones; brave whistleblowers such as Mid Staffs nurse Helene Donnelly; and campaigners who suffered tragedies elsewhere such as James Titcombe, who never gave up the fight after losing his son Joshua at Morecambe Bay. They suffered greatly for their selfless determination to ensure that their personal losses were not in vain. All of us in the House are humbled today to stand in the giant shadow of their bravery.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/3">Robert Francis and his team also deserve huge credit. Their diligence and thoughtfulness led to an outstanding reform, which will transform our NHS for the better. Finally, let me pay tribute to all NHS front-line staff for whom reading about these events in the media has been immensely distressing. We owe it to them to make sure that poor care is never again allowed to take root and survive unchallenged in our NHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/4">Since our initial response to the inquiry in March, much has happened. Thirteen hospitals have been put into special measures as part of a tough new failure regime. Those hospitals, where poor care had been allowed to persist, are now being turned around, and I thank the Keogh inquiry team for its painstaking work in that area. Independent Ofsted-style ratings of hospitals are under way, led by Professor Sir Mike Richards, the new chief inspector of hospitals. The first 18 trusts are currently being inspected, with quality of care and safety paramount. We have appointed new chief inspectors of adult social care and general practice, whose robust inspections of care homes, domiciliary care and surgeries start next year, and surgical survival rates for 10 major specialties have been published by individual surgeons, making the NHS a world-leader in transparency.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/5">Today the Government are publishing our further response to the inquiry, as well as our response to the Select Committee on Health&#8217;s report on the inquiry. Both responses have been laid before Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/6">The NHS is a moral being or it is nothing. It was set up 65 years ago with the noble ideal that no one should ever be prevented by background or finance from accessing the best care. That is why it remains the most loved British institution, and rightly so. But each and every case of poor care betrays those worthy aims. I do not simply want to prevent another Mid Staffs. I want our NHS to be a beacon across the world for not just its equity but its excellence. I want it to offer the safest, most compassionate and most effective care available anywhere. I believe that it can, but only if there is a profound transformation of the culture in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/7">The inquiry shows the devastating effects of overly defensive responses: hurting families, suppressing the truth and preventing lessons from being learned. Failure</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/8">cannot be addressed when it is covered up, so today I am announcing new measures to promote a culture of openness and transparency. From 2014, every organisation registered with the Care Quality Commission will have a statutory duty of candour. Patients must be told promptly about any avoidable harm, but there will be a statutory requirement to notify any harm that has led to avoidable death or serious injury.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/9">We will consult on whether hospitals that are found not to have been open and transparent with patients or families at the earliest reasonable opportunity should risk having their indemnity from litigation awards reduced or removed by the NHS Litigation Authority. The signal must go out loud and clear from hospital boards and chief executives to all clinicians: if in doubt, report an incident and tell the patient. The professional regulators have agreed to place a new, strengthened professional duty of candour on all doctors and nurses. Failing to inform a patient, not reporting avoidable harm or obstructing someone else seeking to do so will be subject to sanctions, including being struck off.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/10">Inspired by the airline industry, the duty will cover &#8220;near misses&#8221;&#8212;occasions when mistakes were made that could have led to harm and from which we need to learn. Conversely, prompt reporting may be considered as a mitigating factor in a professional conduct hearing. That is not about penalising staff for making mistakes; it is about enabling them to learn from them. The NHS will adopt a culture of learning, as recommended by Don Berwick and his expert committee, and I thank them for their seminal report.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/11">A culture of openness also means learning from complaints. In line with the recommendations of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40194" name="Ann Clwyd">the right hon. Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)</phrase> and Professor Tricia Hart&#8217;s excellent review, all patients will be able to access independent help in making their complaint, with clear signs in every ward explaining how to do so. The chief inspector of hospitals will inspect complaints handling to establish whether trusts are genuinely seeking to understand and learn from them; every quarter, trusts will publish the number of complaints received and lessons learned; and the health service ombudsman will dramatically increase the number of cases she looks at in detail.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/12"><a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131122/corrtext/131122c0001.htm#column_12-14MC"><i>[Official Report, 22 November 2013, Vol. 570, c. 12-14MC.]</i></a>It is impossible to deliver safe care without safe staffing levels. All hospitals will be required to monitor their staffing levels on a ward-by-ward basis, analysing precisely how many shifts meet safe staffing guidelines. By the end of this year, this will be done using models independently approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. No hospital will be able to conceal unsafe staffing from the public because from next June all that data, both at ward and hospital level, will be published alongside other safety data on a new NHS safety website, triggering CQC action if there is cause for concern.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/13">Things are already changing for the better and I am pleased to report that trusts are planning to recruit an additional 3,700 nurses compared with a year ago, but we need to go further to train and motivate staff, particularly the health care assistants and social care support workers who perform so much vital care. Health care assistants and social care support workers will be required to have a new care certificate to ensure that no one is ever asked to perform personal care without adequate training, whether in hospitals or care homes. The title &#8220;nursing assistants&#8221; will be used widely in</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/14">hospitals, and paths to nursing careers will be improved. I thank Camilla Cavendish for her excellent work in this area.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/15">We also need to broaden the talent pool going into NHS management positions, in particular by attracting more clinicians and those with good external experience. We have introduced a fast-track leadership programme, sending 50 people a year to a world-leading business school followed by time shadowing top NHS chief executives.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/16">Robert Francis correctly highlighted the failure of regulatory systems to identify quickly what happened at Mid Staffs. Subsequently it has become clear that Ministers put pressure on regulators that may have led them to tone down news about poor care. That is totally unacceptable, so we will strengthen the statutory independence surrounding reports into care quality. The chief inspector will be the nation&#8217;s whistleblower-in-chief and nothing must ever be allowed to stand in his way.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/17">The CQC can prosecute when fundamental standards are breached and trusts put into special measures will have a strictly limited time to get their house in order before administration is considered. Foundation trusts in special measures will have their autonomy suspended and action will be taken to ensure that they quickly improve. No trust will be able to progress to foundation status unless it is rated good or outstanding.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/18">Proper accountability must be at the heart of the NHS. I have therefore accepted Professor Berwick&#8217;s recommendation of legal sanctions for those found guilty of wilful neglect or ill treatment. There will be a new criminal offence for care providers that supply or publish false or misleading information and a new fit and proper persons test will enable the CQC to bar unfit directors from boards.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/19">Finally, every hospital patient should have the names of a responsible consultant and nurse above their bed. Starting with over-75s from next April, there will be a named accountable clinician for out-of-hospital care for vulnerable older people.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/20">One of the most chilling accounts in the Francis report came from Mid Staffs employees who considered the care they saw to be &#8220;normal&#8221;. Cruelty became normal in our NHS and no one noticed. The Francis report made 290 recommendations. I accept the principles behind all of them, and wherever possible have adopted the practical solutions suggested by the inquiry. Robert Francis has welcomed today&#8217;s announcement as a carefully considered and thorough response to his recommendations, which he says will contribute greatly towards a new culture of caring and making our hospitals safer places for their patients.</p>
	<p pid="d.1095.1/21">Today&#8217;s measures are a blueprint for restoring trust in the NHS, reinforcing professional pride in NHS front-line staff and above all giving confidence to patients that after Mid Staffs the NHS has listened, the NHS has learned and the NHS will not rest until it is delivering the safest, most effective and most compassionate care anywhere in the world. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-19d.1097.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40361" speakername="Andy Burnham" colnum="1097"  time="013:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0001.htm#131119-0001.htm_spnew108">
	<p pid="d.1097.0/1">What happened at Mid Staffs was a betrayal of the NHS and its values. The previous Government rightly apologised, but now is the time to back our words with action. That is why, although</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/2">I welcome much of what the Secretary of State has just said, it is my job to press him on where we feel he could have gone further and to question why, of the 290 Francis recommendations, 86 are not being implemented in full.</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/3">First, let me, too, pay tribute to my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40194" name="Ann Clwyd">the Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd)</phrase>, Professor Tricia Hart, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, Camilla Cavendish, Professor Don Berwick and, of course, Robert Francis. Between them, they have given us proposals that will help to prevent a repeat but, more importantly, as the Secretary of State said, change the whole of the NHS for the better.</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/4">Both Francis reports found three primary and fundamental causes of what went wrong: a failure to listen to patients; a lack of properly trained staff; and a dysfunctional culture. I shall take each of those issues in turn.</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/5">First, I am sure the Secretary of State agrees with me that patients and their families must always, as Francis recommends, be the first priority for the NHS. That principle unites this House and it must also unite the NHS. Is not Robert Francis right to recommend that the NHS constitution, and the ethos it sets out, should be required reading for all NHS staff? I congratulate the right hon. Gentleman on agreeing to implement the Clywd review in full and change the way the NHS handles complaints.</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/6">Secondly, on the issue of staffing numbers and training, the first Francis report found that Mid Staffs made dangerous cuts to front-line staffing over a short period. I welcome the Government&#8217;s new focus on this issue, but is it not the case that nurse-patient ratios across the NHS have got significantly worse in the past three years, with 5,890 fewer nurses, more older patients in hospital and bed occupancy running at record levels? It is encouraging that the NHS has plans to recruit more nurses this year, and is introducing more monitoring. The Secretary of State says &#8220;things are already changing for the better&#8221;, but is he aware that Monitor has warned that trusts are planning major nurse redundancies in the 2014-16 period, far outweighing any increases this year? Will he intervene now to stop that? Further, can he explain why he stopped short of requiring safe staffing levels? Is he further aware that nurse training places have been severely cut in recent years and trusts are being forced to recruit overseas?</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/7">Alongside nursing, more action is needed to raise standards across the caring work force. As Robert Francis has said, it is unacceptable that the security guard at the door of the hospital is more regulated, and subject to professional sanctions, than the health care assistant attending to an elderly patient. The development of the care certificate as proposed by Camilla Cavendish is a step forward, but will it not work only alongside a register of those who hold it and an ability to remove it if they fall short? Was not Robert Francis right to recommend a system of regulation for health care assistants and, going forward, will the Government reconsider their decision to rule this out? Overall, although there is progress on staffing today, it does not go far enough and we will continue to challenge the Government on it.</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/8">Thirdly, on culture change, Francis&#8217;s central proposal is a new duty of candour on organisations and individuals. Extending the duty to organisations is a step forward,</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/9">but patient groups are disappointed today that it will cover only the most serious incidents. Can the right hon. Gentleman say why it has not been extended to all incidents of harm? Further, it is not clear how an organisational duty alone will help individuals challenge an organisation where there is a dysfunctional culture. Is it not the case that an individual duty as proposed by Francis is essential? This point comes over clearly from the evidence given to Francis from a senior, soon to be retired consultant. He said:</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/10">&#8220;I took the path of least resistance . . . here were also veiled threats at the time, that I should not rock the boat at my stage in life.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/11">It is only when an individual is both required to speak out, and protected in doing so, that this House can say it has done enough to safeguard patients.</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/12">The duty of openness and transparency should apply equally to all organisations providing NHS services including, as Francis rightly recommends, contractors providing outsourced services. Given that this Government are bringing into the NHS more outside providers, patients will need reassurance that we do not have an uneven playing field where private providers face less scrutiny. So will the Secretary of State extend the duty of candour to all health care organisations, as Francis proposed? His amendments to the Care Bill do not make that clear. And should not he now commit to extending freedom of information law to any provider of NHS services?</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/13">On openness, Francis made a direct call on the Government to set an example to the rest of the NHS. He said that</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/14">&#8220;risk assessments should be made public, and debated publicly, before a proposal for any major structural change to the healthcare system is accepted.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/15">Given that the Government claim today to be accepting this, should they not show now that they mean what they say by finally publishing the risk register on the current reorganisation of the NHS?</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/16">Finally, on openness, the NHS would be more accountable to families with a proper system of death certification. The House will remember that this was a recommendation of the Dame Janet Smith inquiry into the Shipman murders. The report today says that the Francis recommendations on this are not accepted in full. If we fail to act now, might people be justified in thinking that this House has not learned the lessons of tragedies that have gone before? If the Secretary of State brings forward proposals, we will work with him on a cross-party basis to implement them.</p>
	<p pid="d.1097.0/17">In conclusion, I do not believe that cruelty has become normal in the NHS, but there is a much deeper question for us all and that is how, in the century of the ageing society, we do a better job of caring for older people. We should not accept the situation where, as Cavendish says, people are paid less than the national minimum wage. Should we not all set much higher ambitions for the care of older people and, in so doing, learn the most fundamental lesson of all from what happened at Mid Staffs?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-19d.1099.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40561" speakername="Jeremy Hunt" colnum="1099"  time="013:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0001.htm#131119-0001.htm_spnew109">
	<p pid="d.1099.0/1">Let me take the right hon. Gentleman&#8217;s points in turn. First, he will know, because this is what happened after the Bristol inquiry and the Shipman</p>
	<p pid="d.1099.0/2">inquiry under the previous Government, that Governments do not always accept every single recommendation. What I have said today is that we accept all the principles behind every single one of Robert Francis&#8217;s recommendations. We are implementing 204 in full, and in respect of the 86 that we are not implementing exactly as he said, we are doing everything we can to make sure that we implement the spirit behind them, but we need to make sure that everything we do is workable in practice. Francis himself has said that it is a &#8220;carefully considered&#8221; response that is a &#8220;comprehensive collection of measures&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1099.0/3">On staffing numbers, which is an essential part of what we have to consider, if the right hon. Gentleman looks at the nursing hours per bed, he will find that they have gone up since 2010, not down. We recognise the crucial importance of front-line staff, which is why I gently say to him that we made some reforms to the NHS that meant that there are 5,500 more doctors on the front line and 8,000 fewer managers. What we also need is more nurses. That is why it is so encouraging that in response to what Robert Francis has said and the recognition throughout the NHS of the importance of compassionate care, we are getting a reaction from NHS trusts&#8212;not as a result of a direct ministerial decision, but because trusts themselves are recognising the importance of compassionate care. We think that is a very encouraging sign.</p>
	<p pid="d.1099.0/4">With respect to whether staffing levels should be mandatory, we agree that there are minimum recommended staffing levels, but they are not the same for every ward in every hospital. The minimum level might be one in six for an acute medical unit, one in four for a general medical unit, and one on one for intensive care. We took extensive advice on whether it would be appropriate to set a national minimum mandatory number. Not only is the chief nurse and leading nurses from across the country against this; the King&#8217;s Fund and the British Medical Association are against it. The BMA said something today in a statement which I never thought I would read in my lifetime&#8212;it said that the &#8220;Government is right&#8221; on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="d.1099.0/5">The right hon. Gentleman also opposed mandatory staffing levels back in 2011, although it is fair to say that in the House his position on this has changed. The important thing is that we allow local discretion to make sure that nursing levels are adequate, and that where they are not, that is exposed quickly so that there is no repetition of what happened at Mid Staffs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1099.0/6">On the regulation of health care assistants, every health care assistant will have to have a care certificate. Effectively, there will be a database which allows employers to check whether someone has such a certificate. That is a kind of register. The other reason for people talking about the regulation of health care assistants is that they want to make sure that if someone fails in their duty of care, they are not able to appear somewhere else in the country. That is why we have a vetting and barring scheme to make sure that that does not happen.</p>
	<p pid="d.1099.0/7">On the individual duty of candour, let us be clear: we want total candour about all avoidable harm, at every stage that it happens, anywhere in the NHS. We decided after much discussion that extending the statutory duty of candour to individual front-line clinicians would be likely to create a huge amount of bureaucracy and damage the culture of openness that we are trying to</p>
	<p pid="d.1099.0/8">create, because everyone would constantly be worried about whether or not they were breaking the law. We decided that the right way to achieve the objective is through a professional duty of candour, which is much stronger than the current professional duty states. Critically&#8212;this is a key change&#8212;we decided to make sure that, just as airline pilots have protection if they speak out, if front-line NHS employees speak out, they too will get protection if there is a professional conduct case, and that openness at an early stage will be treated as a mitigating factor. That is really important in terms of changing the culture.</p>
	<p pid="d.1099.0/9">Finally, we absolutely do need to resolve the issue of death certificates. It is important that we have an independent view to certify deaths. It is a question of finding a practical way to make sure that we do that, but we very much accept the spirit of what Robert Francis said.</p>
	<p pid="d.1099.0/10">Today I hope that we will find a way forward on all the problems that Robert Francis addressed in his response and that we have been thinking hard about. I urge the shadow Secretary of State to join Government Members in saying that this is a moment when the NHS can once again reach forward and aim to be the very best in the world, because the kind of measures that we are talking about are not happening anywhere else, and that is something of which we can all be very proud.</p>

	<p pid="d.1101.0/1">I thank my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for his statement and commitment. A culture of compassionate and safe care for all in the NHS must be the legacy of the Francis inquiry. It is the least that those who suffered from dreadful neglect, and their loved ones who campaigned for justice, deserve. Staff throughout Mid Staffordshire trust have made firm strides since then in improving that culture with clear results in patient care, but will my right hon.

	<p pid="d.1101.1/1">That is the central change in culture that we need throughout the NHS. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend in particular, because he has had a more difficult challenge with respect to his local hospital than any hon. Member. He has campaigned for the people who use that hospital and for the staff there with great integrity and courage, which I commend.</p>
	<p pid="d.1101.1/2">I have never believed that there is a conflict or a choice between putting NHS staff first and putting the patient first. I have never met a doctor or nurse who does not want to put the patient first. The trouble is that we have created structures and incentives that make it difficult for front-line staff to do what they joined the NHS to do, which is to care for patients with dignity, compassion and respect.

	<p pid="d.1101.2/1">I am grateful for the kind words about the report from the Secretary of State and from my right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State. If I may plug our report for a moment, &#8220;A Review of the NHS Hospitals Complaints System: Putting Patients Back in the Picture&#8221; is available. I have not yet gone through the tick-list of all the things that we asked for, but I shall be doing that. The Secretary of State has agreed that we can monitor the progress that Sir Mike Richards makes in putting complaints and the treatment of complaints at the top of his list when he visits hospitals around in the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.1101.2/2">May I press the Secretary of State on one point? He said in his statement that &#8220;all patients will be able to access independent help in making their complaint&#8221;. How exactly will that be done and how will it be resourced? I am grateful to the many thousands of people who wrote to me during the course of the review who complained about similar experiences to mine on the lack of care and compassion. That applies not just to nurses, but throughout the NHS from top to bottom. I hope that this will address some of the many complaints from Stafford and elsewhere.</p>

	<p pid="d.1102.0/1">I congratulate the right hon. Lady on the extremely good report that she produced. I hope she will not find herself in a position of wanting to complain to me about the way in which I have implemented her report on complaints, because we intend to take it extremely seriously. She knows that I basically accept everything she said in it, although we will have to work carefully on the implementation of some things to make sure we get them right. She highlights one of the most fundamental problems. Probably the biggest problem is that some hospitals treat their complaints procedure as a process rather than something that they can learn from. Every NHS patient whom I have met who has had problems only ever says the same thing. They just want to know that the NHS will learn from what has gone wrong. That is all that they are interested in.</p>
	<p pid="d.1102.0/2">The point that the right hon. Lady makes is a very important one. People do sometimes feel that it is them against the system, and taking on a big establishment that might be well funded and is not really interested in hearing what they have to say is a very lonely process. It is vital that everyone who wants it can get independent support. One thing that we will be requiring is a sign, prominently displayed in every ward of every hospital, telling people, first, how they can make a complaint, and secondly, how if they want it they can get independent help and support. That could be a very good role for the new healthwatch organisations, but it may not be them in all cases, so most importantly, we will insist that people everywhere can access that independent help.</p>

I agreed with everything she said. Does he acknowledge that, although my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister listened, after correspondence and meetings with him, to my repeated calls and motions for the setting up of an inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005, which the Prime Minister set up and which has led to a complete shake-up, not only of Mid Staffs but the entire health service, successive Labour Secretaries of State in the last Government disgracefully and repeatedly refused to agree to such an inquiry, and that but for our determined campaign with Cure the NHS, and in particular Julie Bailey, Debra Hazeldine and Ken Lownds and his campaign for zero harm, the 2005 Act inquiry would never have taken place and the Francis report would never have been produced, with all its beneficial consequences, in the Secretary of State&#8217;s hands, for the NHS in the national interest?

	<p pid="d.1103.0/1">I did not hear Deb Hazeldine this morning, but I have met her on a number of occasions, and she is an extraordinary, powerful advocate for the changes that we need to make in the NHS. I have had discussions with my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House about the possibility of debating this on the Floor of the House, and I would very much welcome the opportunity to do so. My right hon. Friend deserves great credit for the fact that he was one of the earliest people to push for a full inquiry. I hope that the shadow Secretary of State will now accept that it was wrong not to have a public inquiry&#8212;it was blocked so many times by the Labour party&#8212;because we have learned so much from what Robert Francis has been able to say, and the NHS will be the better for it.

	<p pid="d.1103.1/1">Does the Secretary of State not agree that the horrors of Mid Staffs were taking place at the same time that wonderful first-class care, from both a clinical and compassionate point of view, was available in many hospitals throughout the country?

	<p pid="d.1103.2/1">We have to wait and see, but we have put in place a radical, tough new Ofsted-style inspection regime. The point of that regime is not just to identify hospitals where care is unsafe, but also to identify outstanding hospitals, so that hospitals in difficulty have hospitals from which they can learn, and we create a culture, just as we have in schools, where failing schools learn from outstanding schools and have a pathway to improvement. That will make a big difference. As the right hon. Gentleman knows, we now have 13 hospitals in special measures, and I am sure there will be more as the inspection process gets under way. But we will also have the great hospitals that we can learn from, which will mean that this can be a positive process for the NHS.</p>

	<p pid="d.1103.3/1">I commend my right hon. Friend for the thoughtful and thorough way in which he has conducted the reaction to the publication of the Francis inquiry. Does he agree that the most chilling finding of Francis was that professional people whose focus should have been on the needs of their patients found themselves, in Francis&#8217;s words, &#8220;doing the system&#8217;s business&#8221;? Is not the central driver of my right hon.

	<p pid="d.1103.4/1">My right hon. Friend, as so often, speaks wisely. This is probably the boldest step towards transparency taken by any health care system anywhere in the world. We will see if he is right, but I think that he is, because sunlight is the best disinfectant. It means that problems are sorted out much more quickly, but it is sometimes an uncomfortable process. It is really important that we as a country understand that exposing poor care in one place does not mean that there is poor care everywhere and that, in fact, exposing it is the quickest way to sort it out.</p>

	<p pid="d.1104.0/1">We need total candour with regard to avoidable deaths. The only way to determine that is through an independent review of medical case notes by neutral clinicians. That exercise took place at Stafford. Will the Secretary of State remind us of the result?</p>

Gentleman&#8217;s point about avoidable deaths, because one of the changes we want to make today is to avoid the temptation, when there is an avoidable death, for people on the front line to say that it was unavoidable.

May I ask the Secretary of State about his plans to prosecute if the fundamental standards are breached, which is an important step with regard to corporate criminal accountability? In drafting those standards, will he ensure that advice is sought from the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Health and Safety Executive and others to ensure that the wording is clear and fit for purpose so that when a prosecution takes place there is no hiding behind the language in those fundamental standards?</p>

	<p pid="d.1104.3/1">We will absolutely do that. We are in the process of a very big consultation to ensure that we get the definitions of the fundamental standards absolutely right, but we also want to try to create a culture that means we do not get to that point in the first place. One of the problems we had with the current system is that the definition of success for a hospital tended to be about meeting waiting time targets and financial balance, rather than caring for patients properly. We want to re-engineer the system through the new inspection regime so that a hospital cannot be good or outstanding unless it is delivering good or outstanding care.</p>

Friend the shadow Secretary of State, but my constituents will be concerned about the impact of whatever the trust special administrator decides is right for Mid Staffordshire on the university hospital and the care they will receive there. Whether as a result of pressures from Cannock Chase or other areas, there is the risk that work will go to the university hospital but that it will not be fully recompensed for what is needed and that&#8212;this is a terrible thing to talk about in these terms&#8212;the profitable work that would otherwise cross-subsidise that might well go to other areas.

Lady has campaigned a great deal on the needs of people with dementia, and I share her desire to do much better for them. Salford Royal is one of the best hospitals in the country and we should always learn from what it does, but 25% of people in hospitals now have dementia. The tragedy of what happened at Mid Staffs and of many of the stories of poor care in other hospitals that we read about is that very often they involve people with dementia, because they are the kinds of people who have been deprioritised when hospital managements have decided, for example,</p>
	<p pid="d.1106.5/2">that they want to cut nursing inappropriately. We absolutely have to change that culture. There is now a very good system at several hospitals. People with dementia, in particular, must be helped to eat and drink at meal times. Many of us have been shocked by the stories of full trays of food being taken away because someone is unable to eat unaided. That, in particular, we need to stamp right out.</p>

	<p pid="d.1107.1/1">It is really important that we value the work of some of the lowest-paid people in hospitals who are carrying out some of the most important personal care for patients. They need to be managed properly, fairly and decently, given how important that work is. We need to ensure that nurses have the right attitude to the health care assistants who are working for them&#8212;as, most of the time, they absolutely do. That is why earlier in the year we proposed changes that we are piloting, so that before getting funding for a nursing degree, people had to spend time, potentially up to a year, on the front line as health care assistants. That will allow them to experience just how important that work is and then perhaps appreciate it a bit more.</p>

	<p pid="d.1107.4/1">We now know that poor care was allowed to continue at Mid Staffs because staff were simply too afraid to speak out and, if they did, they were ignored or, worse, their careers were threatened. The high death rates at Stafford hospital were not taken seriously enough at the time and were merely explained away rather than used as an alarm signal that should have triggered further investigations. There was clearly a culture of fear among NHS staff, many of whom witnessed the appalling care of my constituents. Will my right hon. Friend make it</p>
	<p pid="d.1107.4/2">his legacy to instil a culture of candour and openness in the NHS whereby concerns are acted on and high standardised mortality ratios are no longer brushed under the carpet to protect the NHS&#8217;s reputation but are instead properly investigated so that patient safety finally comes first?</p>

	<p pid="d.1108.0/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. These problems of high mortality rates date back very many years, and nothing, or too little, was done to sort them out. We must therefore make sure that we have a system where that cannot happen. Concealing poor care does not protect the reputation of the NHS, because in the end it gets out and destroys public confidence. I hope his constituents will feel that today&#8217;s announcements will create a new culture of openness and transparency that gives them confidence, so that if these awful things were ever to happen again&#8212;we hope they do not&#8212;we would find out quickly and action would be taken.</p>

	<p pid="d.1108.1/1">Having spent nine years as a lay member of the General Medical Council and five years chairing the Health Committee, I have heard little this afternoon that is likely to change the culture inside the national health service. May I refer the Secretary of State to the report on patient safety that the Committee produced in the previous Parliament? We considered the idea of having a statutory ombudsman to whom people could complain and who would have the power to investigate, even anonymously, instead of this situation in which doctors, particularly young doctors working in hospitals, dare not complain about what senior doctors are doing because of the attack on their career structure. We really must get some independence into this. We can have good words, we can talk about candour, and we can wish a lot of things, but changing the culture of the NHS is not done by statements or by legislation in this House; it is done by working inside the NHS. I am afraid that at the moment the system works against changing the culture owing to career structures and everything else. We need some independence in all this so that people can really learn how to change. New Zealand would be a good example to look at.</p>

	<p pid="d.1108.2/4">Independence is a vital part of this change, so what are we doing to create it? For the first time, we will have an independent chief inspector of hospitals who goes anywhere he likes in the system to try to root out poor care. That person will be the nation&#8217;s whistleblower-in-chief, and their job will be to find out about these things inside hospitals. We are creating a culture in which it is in the interests of hospitals and doctors to be open and transparent, and that is another significant change. I do not want to underestimate the scale of the challenge we face, but I think most people would say that in the past 12 months we have seen one of the most fundamental attempts to change the culture of the NHS in its 65-year history.</p>

	<p pid="d.1109.1/1">The biggest assurance that patients will have is that the definition of success as regards how the system views a hospital will be the same as patients&#8217; definition of success. They want to go somewhere that treats them promptly and safely and with decent, compassionate care. That has not been how the system has judged the success of a hospital or its chief executive or board. That is why it is such a profound change to have a new chief inspector and Ofsted-style ratings.

Does he understand that many members of the public feel that one of the problems with general standards of care in the health service may have been the push&#8212;under a Labour Government &#8212;for an all-graduate nursing profession? There is a strongly held view among members of the public that that has led to elevating taking exams and inputting data on a computer over providing basic levels of care, which is what they really value in a nurse.</p>

She points to something that the public feel very strongly about and that is an issue in some parts of the nursing profession. We looked carefully at whether we should remove the requirement for graduate qualifications and decided that nurses are now asked to do a great deal more than they were 20, 30 or 40 years ago in, for example, giving people medication and the clinical procedures they are asked to be involved in. We need to make sure that there is the right culture in nursing. That is why I proposed&#8212;it was very controversial at the time, although I think it has been quite broadly accepted now&#8212;that before becoming a nurse people should spend some time, potentially up to a year, on the front line as a health care assistant to make sure that those going into nursing had the right values and recognised that giving this personal care is a fundamental part of what being a nurse should always be about.</p>

The changes are likely to result in&#8212;my hon. Friend will be the first to notice this&#8212;an increase in the amount of reported harm over the next few months.

That is incredibly important, and the ombudsman has herself agreed that she will handle vastly more complaints and go into detail a lot more than she does at present, which is welcome. Prior to that stage, however, lots of people feel that complaining directly to the trust, which has to be the first step, is a very daunting and difficult process and that they want independent help. That is why we have said that it will be an absolute requirement for trusts to show people how they can access that independent help and, indeed, to be prepared to make the finance available so that they get that help.

What it does is support minimum safe staffing levels for patients and then publish the actual-versus-planned staffing levels on the wards every day. Staffing levels published on websites is a little step forward, but it is not enough. Why do we not learn from what Salford Royal does?

It uses the kind of model to ensure minimum recommended staffing levels on every ward that we want every hospital to use. We say that we want those data published monthly, but that is a minimum. Salford Royal publishes them every day, which is very impressive. Given that most hospitals are not using tools anything like as sophisticated as that, it will be a big step up for most hospitals to do that. We want to do it. What is significant about our announcement is that we want to assemble those data for every trust in the country so that they can be compared on a monthly basis and so that people can know how many wards and how many shifts are being safely staffed at their local hospital compared with neighbouring hospitals.</p>

Friend said, is that we cannot let poor standards and poor care persist over a long period.

	<p pid="d.1114.2/2">It seems to me that one of the reasons for cruelty&#8212;and it does happen&#8212;is the stress of under-staffing. I understand that, as a result of the report, the Secretary of State will publish safe staffing levels ward by ward, but that he will not enforce them.

	<p pid="d.1115.1/1">That is absolutely vital. I have been to the A and E department in George Eliot hospital, and reports I have heard say that morale is really turning a corner. I want to back the staff: it is incredibly difficult to work in a hospital that has been put into special measures, knowing that everything is not as it should be. They now have a sense that a corner is being turned and that the problems that they have long worried about are finally being addressed, particularly because of the link with University Hospitals Birmingham, which is one of the best in the country.</p>

When somebody goes into hospital, they want to have confidence that they will be treated efficiently and with a great deal of care. They get that confidence not just from statistics on the number of nurses or clinicians on a ward, but from the experiences that they hear about from friends and relatives who have been treated at the same hospital. They also get confidence from hearing examples of where things have gone wrong&#8212;some things will always go wrong&#8212;and that the complaints have been handled quickly and efficiently, and have not been dragged out.

	<p pid="d.1116.3/1">I totally agree with my hon. Friend. That is why I hope that what we have announced today will bring about a transformation in the way in which hospitals manage complaints. Some excellent work has been done to help us do that. The heart of the matter is that hospitals should be really interested in the complaints that they receive, because that will enable them to understand where they are not delivering good care and what they can do to put it right. That does not happen everywhere. Too often, the complaints system is treated as a process, in effect, to fob people off, rather than to get to the heart of what people are talking about. We absolutely need to change that.</p>

	<p pid="d.1117.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to amend the Employment Rights Act 1996 to provide that disclosures of information about malpractice to a Member of Parliament where the disclosure is in the public interest be included as protected disclosures; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/3">In the last decade of the last century, one of the most important Bills that was passed by this House was introduced not by the Government, but by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40040" name="Richard Shepherd">the Member for Aldridge-Brownhills (Sir Richard Shepherd)</phrase>, with all-party support. His Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998 followed a series of accidents that were fatal and entirely preventable, including the capsized car ferry at Zeebrugge, the explosion of the Piper Alpha oil rig and the Clapham junction rail crash, which between them cost 395 lives.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/4">In the 15 years since the Act was passed, British society has benefited hugely from the bravery of whistleblowers. Those public-spirited men and women have shamed corrupt officials, identified heartless and hopeless hospitals, and exposed the deliberate or reckless misuse of public money. In the past five years alone, whistleblowers have exposed pharmaceutical companies that have overcharged the NHS for drugs; alerted the National Audit Office to the tax authorities agreeing sweetheart deals, which let multinational companies reduce their tax bills by billions; filmed the abuse and neglect of elderly people in care homes; and exposed a litany of failings in our health service&#8212;some of which we have just heard about&#8212;such as the appalling standards of care at Mid Staffordshire, the failing maternity unit at Morecambe Bay and fiddled waiting time figures at Colchester.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/5">Thanks to the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998, whistleblowers have some protection. Employment tribunals have made 3,000 judgments in cases brought under that legislation. However, those cases are just the tip of the iceberg. For every whistleblower who goes public with their concerns, many more never come to light. The decision to expose wrongdoing is a life-changing choice. Whistleblowers find themselves shunned by colleagues, bullied by bosses and hauled before tribunals on trumped-up charges. Ugly rumours are started and careers finished. Whistleblowers&#8217; health, wealth, friendships and marriages are tested to destruction&#8212;all casualties of their acting in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/6">Let me take one example to illustrate the point. The story of Edwin Jesudason is typical. As a paediatric surgeon with more than 20 years&#8217; experience, he raised concerns that children had died unnecessarily at Alder Hey children&#8217;s hospital. As a result, colleagues refused to work with him. Trust bosses tried to force him out. When that failed, they tried to gag him by offering him a six-figure sum if he left his job, kept his mouth shut and destroyed incriminating documents. He refused to take the money. Last year, he sought an injunction to stop trust bosses sacking him. Halfway through the hearing, the British Medical Association suddenly withdrew its support. Near bankrupt, he had to drop the case.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/7">That case is shocking, but it is not remotely unique. In April, a poll showed that, of more than 5,000 nurses who had reported substandard care, a quarter were warned against taking the matter further. Half of all whistleblowers face negative treatment of that sort, with a third of those being sacked. Faced with such treatment or the threat of it, many whistleblowers admit defeat. Hundreds have been pressured into signing compromise agreements, complete with gagging clauses that buy their silence. In the last four years, 77 NHS trusts have used gagging orders to silence 133 staff at a cost of almost &#163;4 million.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/8">The culture of secrecy clearly comes at a financial cost, but more objectionable is the unquantifiable impact on our society and public services. The lives needlessly lost or irreversibly damaged; the unsuitable managers and staff allowed to continue in their posts; the missed opportunities to learn from mistakes&#8212;that is the real cost of using public money against the public interest. Every time a whistleblower is dismissed, ignored or bullied into submission, a cover-up is allowed to continue.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/9">That is why I welcome the Government&#8217;s decision to use the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 to strengthen the legal protection for whistleblowers. However, I believe that we should go even further. In February, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills published a 22-page document called &#8220;Blowing the whistle to a prescribed person&#8212;List of prescribed people and bodies&#8221;, which lists the bodies that a whistleblower can contact if they do not feel that they can go to their employer. The list includes Revenue and Customs, the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Care Quality Commission, but not the whistleblower&#8217;s Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/10">That means that whistleblowers who report wrongdoing to their MP will not automatically be protected by law. Those conversations will be protected only if the whistleblower meets a series of conditions set out in section 43G of the Employment Rights Act 1996, which includes notifying a potentially hostile employer, showing that the wrongdoing is exceptionally serious and demonstrating a reasonable belief that their employer will destroy vital evidence. If they cannot meet those conditions, whistleblowers who contact their MP place themselves at the mercy of employers who may want them to be victimised, sidelined or even sacked. I believe that that is wrong. Whistleblowers should not have to consult a solicitor in order to talk freely to their Member of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/11">The Bill therefore seeks to do three things. First, it will ensure that a whistleblower&#8217;s disclosures to their Member of Parliament will be unconditionally protected for the purposes of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. Secondly, it would make it a criminal offence for an employer to try and prevent a worker from blowing the whistle to their MP. There will be some narrowly defined exceptions, particularly over the Official Secrets Act, but even those could be overridden if the disclosure was clearly in the public interest. Third, it would empower Members of Parliament to refer allegations made by a whistleblowing constituent to a prescribed body, and it would enable that Member of Parliament to require from any one of those prescribed bodies a confidential response. In that way, the Bill would extend legal protection to whistleblowers&#8217; disclosures to their MP, but also ensure that any allegations are investigated by a body with relevant knowledge and experience.</p>
	<p pid="d.1117.2/12">Whistleblowers often demonstrate great courage, but they should not have to be heroes. Acting in the public interest should not require such huge personal sacrifice, and employers who jeopardise public safety simply to save their reputations should have to explain that choice in court. By shielding these courageous men and women from legal hurdles and vindictive bosses, this proposal would allow Members of this House to protect everyone from waste, corruption and incompetence in business, health care, and more generally in public life.</p>

	<p pid="d.1120.1/3">I welcome Ministers to the Front Bench. Today, once again, the Labour party is highlighting the cost of living crisis that is affecting communities up and down the country, because under this Government the historic link between growth and living standards is being split apart as never before. Growth without national prosperity is not economic success, and the first and last test of economic policy is whether living standards for ordinary families are rising. Official figures state that, on average, working people are &#163;1,500 a year worse off than they were at the general election. The Labour party is determined to shine a light on that quiet scandal of collapsing opportunity and stretched family budgets.</p>

	<p pid="d.1121.6/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, which is why I will draw on the work of the Government&#8217;s Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission. It is clear that high-quality child care can improve child development for the most disadvantaged children, yet nearly half of low-income parents say that cost, rather than quality, was the main factor in choosing child care. As the chair of Ofsted, Baroness Morgan, recently pointed out, getting children school ready by reception year is fundamental to their life chances. We also know that access to universal and affordable child care can lift employment rates. Having both parents in work for long enough is the best guarantee of a life free from poverty.</p>

	<p pid="d.1122.5/2">Sadly, what we have had from the Government is a sustained assault on early-years provision. The coalition&#8217;s child care crunch means that since the last election the cost of nursery places has risen by 30%. There are 578 fewer Sure Start centres, with three being lost on average every week. The cost of a nursery place is now the highest in history, at more than &#163;100 a week to cover part-time hours, and parents working part time on average wages would need to work from Monday to Thursday before they paid off their weekly childcare costs.</p>

	<p pid="d.1123.2/1">It was called Building Schools for the Future, and what the Labour Government were involved in was building schools for the future. We were investing in future school provision. The hon. Gentleman has to get a grip on this: the Government have been in power for three and a half years, and they have to start taking responsibility for the dire situations that we are seeing.</p>
	<p pid="d.1123.2/2">The position is equally tough for families with kids at school. Under the last Labour Government, 99% of schools provided access to breakfast clubs and after-school clubs, but more than a third of local authorities have reported that this has been scaled back in their area under this Government. But that is what we get from the coalition. We get tax cuts for millionaires, but cuts in child care places for millions of families; billions of pounds wasted on botched NHS reorganisations, while parents struggle to pay for nursery places; and a hapless Royal Mail flotation filling the coffers of Lazard, rather than wraparound child care for hard-pressed parents. Those are the wrong priorities for working people&#8212;financial incompetence while families struggle.</p>
	<p pid="d.1123.2/3">As ever with this Government, it has been a case of say one thing and then do another. It was a great Conservative, a real Conservative, a true Conservative, Edmund Burke, who once said that</p>

	<p pid="d.1123.2/5">But how could he know of today&#8217;s Tory party&#8217;s attempt to obliterate the past? Whereas once they revered the wisdom of their elders, now they try to wipe the truth off the internet. For what did the Prime Minister say on the eve of the last general election? He said:</p>
	<p pid="d.1123.2/6">&#8220;Sure Start will stay, and we&#8217;ll improve it. We will keep flexible working, and extend it.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="d.1124.6/1">What a valuable point, which reminds us that the Conservative party opposed the national minimum wage and proper payment for child care workers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1124.6/2">It is the Labour party that has a response to the cost of living crisis. In government, we will deal with the child care crunch by expanding free child care for three-year-olds and four-year-olds from 15 hours to</p>
	<p pid="d.1124.6/3">25 hours per week for working parents. The value of that child care is worth &#163;1,500 per child per year. It would be paid for by increasing the bank levy, charged as a proportion of their liabilities, to raise an extra &#163;800 million. In the past financial year, the banks paid a staggering &#163;2.7 billion less in tax overall than they did in 2010. The Government have given the banks an extraordinary tax break and we would reintroduce some fairness into the system to support our child care plans.</p>

	<p pid="d.1124.6/7">I hear laughter from the Government Benches about our plans for the financial services industry, so I will quote from this Saturday&#8217;s <i>Financial Times</i>:</p>
	<p pid="d.1124.6/8">&#8220;Good times return as City gets in Christmas spirit,&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1124.6/9">reported the paper.</p>

	<p pid="d.1124.6/11">Well, good luck to them. We on the Labour Benches like to see the return of some animal spirits, but all we are saying is that some of that festive frivolity could be spent on securing affordable child care. That is called progressive politics, and the Government parties should try it.</p>
	<p pid="d.1124.6/12">To give parents of primary age children peace of mind, Labour will set down in law a guarantee that they can access child care through their local school if they want it. Parents of primary age children will benefit most from a new guarantee, as this is when families most require child care support. Of course, parents will have to pay for that, just as they do now, but this is an opportunity to deliver sport, music, healthy eating and after-school clubs alongside child care support.</p>
	<p pid="d.1124.6/13">The truth of the matter is this: high-quality child care and early years services are the foundation stone of a successful approach to tackling child poverty and improving social mobility. The Labour party has a costed and effective plan to deliver both. The coalition has broken promises, has poor priorities and has arrogantly refused to deal with the cost of living crisis. I commend this motion to the House.</p>

	<p pid="d.1125.0/1">I am afraid that after three years in Opposition, Labour Members seem to have learned nothing. First, they have learned nothing about how they got the country into a financial mess, as they seem to think that the answer is more spending and more borrowing; and secondly, they seem to have learned nothing about child care and how nurseries work. Despite the highfalutin&#8217; rhetoric by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40581" name="Tristram Hunt">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt)</phrase>, he seems to have failed to grasp the numbers behind child care. I will say more on that in a moment. First, let me remind hon. Members how we got here.</p>
	<p pid="d.1125.0/2">The Labour party left the biggest budget deficit among advanced economies and we were borrowing &#163;1 for every &#163;4 we spent. When we came into office, we were spending &#163;110 million just servicing the interest on Labour&#8217;s debt. Despite that terrible inheritance, we have successfully cut the deficit by a third, and prioritised families and children. Total spending on child care and early education is increasing from almost &#163;5 billion to more than &#163;6 billion. We have increased the number of</p>
	<p pid="d.1125.0/3">hours of free early education for every three-year-old and four-year-old, from 12.5 hours to 15 hours a week. We have extended support to two-year-olds from low-income families, with 92,000 two-year-olds already benefiting. From 2015, tax free child care worth up to &#163;1,200 per child will be available to working parents. We are providing real help for hard-working families in tough times, not empty promises and unfunded spending commitments from Labour. That is what this coalition is delivering.</p>

	<p pid="d.1126.0/1">Childminders in my constituency would like to take on more two-year-olds, but the funding provided by the Government does not cover their costs. Does the Minister expect them and other providers to subsidise Government policy?</p>

	<p pid="d.1126.1/1">We are funding the two-year-old offer at an average of &#163;5.09 an hour, and the average rate paid for that age group is &#163;4.23 an hour. We are therefore funding at considerably above the market rate, and we have been very successful at getting places for two-year-olds. <i>[</i><i>Interruption] </i>It is an average.</p>
	<p pid="d.1126.1/2">Let me now turn to some of the spurious claims made by the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central. Labour claims that more than 500 children&#8217;s centres have closed. That is simply not true. Forty five centres have closed since 2010&#8212;just 1% of the total&#8212;and some new centres have opened, including one in Ipswich. Centres are joining networks so that they can be run more efficiently, but the same buildings are open to the same parents to use services. We are seeing a record number of parents and children using children&#8217;s centres&#8212;more than 1 million. I do not understand why the hon. Gentleman does not want to celebrate the success of children&#8217;s centres, rather than constantly talking them down week after week. Children&#8217;s centres are doing a better job than ever under this Government. Let us not confuse children&#8217;s centres and child care providers. Children&#8217;s centres provide less than 1% of child care places.</p>
	<p pid="d.1126.1/3">Labour claims that costs have risen by 30%. That is based on figures from the Family and Childcare Trust. Despite the impression given by the Opposition, those figures were published before 2010. If the Opposition used the pre-2010 data, they would have found that the previous Labour Government were a catastrophe. Between 2002 and 2010, the cost of a nursery place rose by 46%. That is &#163;1,200 a year more for a part-time nursery place for a child over the age of two, but we did not see the hon. Gentleman jumping around then, did we? Labour has, not for the first time, been cherry-picking statistics and ignoring the research. On <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-30">30 September 2013</phrase>, Laing and Buisson published an in-depth report on the child care nurseries market in the UK. The report said that 2012-13 was the second successive year in which the price of full-day care in nurseries had been flat in real terms. In 2012-13, average nursery fees rose by 2.6%, which was the same as inflation. In 2011-12, average fees rose by 2.7%, compared to 3% inflation. In June 2013, the National Day Nurseries Association published the UK nursery insight report, which said: &#8220;58% were freezing fees&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1126.1/4">There we have it: the figures Labour cite actually show how the previous Government drove up costs with their confused funding and complex regulation, while independent research shows that costs have stabilised under this Government.</p>

	<p pid="d.1127.0/1">The Minister referred to the child care survey on increasing costs and pointed out that between 2002 and 2010 there had been an increase of 46% in a period when wages were rising. The same survey shows that the present increase from the baseline is 77%, at a time when wages have fallen.

	<p pid="d.1127.1/1">That 77% starts in 2003, and I believe that the Labour party was in government then.</p>
	<p pid="d.1127.1/2">The hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central claims that we are not supporting school-based child care. On the contrary, the most recent data show a 5% increase in the number of after-school clubs. The difference between our view and his is that we think that school-based child care actually takes place in a school. The Labour party alleges that more than 90% of schools were offering an extended day in 2010, but I do not think that any parents with schoolchildren at that time would recognise that number. A school did not have to provide child care onsite, but could fulfil the requirement by linking to a child care provider on its website. That is what the Labour party meant by &#8220;extended day&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1127.1/3">It turns out that the Opposition&#8217;s new offer is no different. The shadow child care Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40691" name="Lucy Powell">the hon. Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell)</phrase>, wrote recently that</p>
	<p pid="d.1127.1/4">&#8220;if a school chooses not to stay open longer hours because they do not need to offer this provision on site &#8211; they will not be forced to stay open. Schools can&#8230;facilitate out of hours childcare elsewhere for pupils&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1127.1/5">The shadow Secretary of State has a vision of children playing sport after school, but this after-school provision would not have to be on the school site and would be paid for by parents. How is that different from the current situation, where people pay a childminder after school? I am not sure how Labour&#8217;s so-called primary school guarantee, which need not take place in school, which schools would simply facilitate and which parents would pay for, would be any different from the current situation. It is a child care mirage: the closer one walks to it, the less certain it seems.</p>

	<p pid="d.1128.0/1">I think the hon. Lady is having a laugh about her child care guarantee. It would not mean that schools have to offer extended hours; they would need only link to a child care provider on a website. That is not what parents mean by extended hours.</p>
	<p pid="d.1128.0/2">I note that the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central did not repeat his leader&#8217;s claim about the number of child care places. Could that be because his leader claimed there were only 1.3 million child care places in the country, when in fact there were more than 2 million, because they missed out the 800,000 places&#8212;30% of the market&#8212;available in schools? The number of settings is going up. It is strange, given that he has talked about his colleague Baroness Morgan advocating child care for two-year-olds in schools, that he does not know that schools provide child care and that his leader did not include those 800,000 places in his statistics. He also seems completely unaware that Building Schools for the Future was not for primary schools, but for secondary schools. Under his Government, funding for primary school places was cut by one quarter.</p>

	<p pid="d.1128.6/1">I am sorry, but I want to talk about child care.</p>
	<p pid="d.1128.6/2">As well as complete economic ineptitude, Labour seems to have learnt nothing from its time in office about child care or nurseries. It still thinks the answer is spending more money, rather than reform. Baroness Hughes, children&#8217;s Minister under the previous Government, admitted that their approach was &#8220;probably wrong.&#8221; She said:</p>
	<p pid="d.1128.6/3">&#8220;We were so keen to stimulate demand from parents but in retrospect that was such a mammoth task. We ought to have focused on the supply side, supporting providers, then we could have done more and quicker.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1128.6/4">I could not agree more, yet Labour has nothing to say about supply; it talks only about spending more money. Let us remember what happened last time it did that. We ended up with some of the highest child care costs in the OECD, parents were paying out 27% of their income on child care, staff had some of the lowest salaries in Europe, contrary to what the shadow Secretary of State said, and under Labour&#8217;s preferred measure, prices increased by 50% during the Labour years.</p>

	<p pid="d.1130.0/2">Labour also had a voucher scheme, but only one fifth of parents could use it&#8212;only those whose employers offered it, and only those who were in employment rather than self-employed. There was no limit on income, unlike tax-free child care, so millionaires got it, but the self-employed did not. That was Labour&#8217;s legacy on child care&#8212;a massive waste of money, added complexity and a huge spreading of confusion.</p>

	<p pid="d.1130.1/1">It was even more unhelpful than that, as my employer offered the child care voucher scheme, but because it was so tightly regulated, even though I was spending a fortune on child care, I was not able to use it.</p>

	<p pid="d.1130.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that point, which illustrates the problem with the child care voucher system.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130.2/2">Let me further point out to Labour Members that in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s, when we had a working mother in charge of our country, England was ahead in respect of maternal employment, but we fell behind other countries such as France and Germany under Labour&#8217;s watch. Maternal employment rates are rapidly rising under this Government. As Edmund Burke pointed out&#8212;the shadow Education Secretary is clearly a big fan&#8212;&#8220;those who don&#8217;t know history are doomed to repeat it&#8221;, and if he has not learnt the lessons that people in the previous Labour Government learnt at the time, he will fail, should he ever get the opportunity to be in office. That is why we are reforming the child care system: we are reforming the hopeless legacy that Labour left.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130.2/3">The signs are that what we are doing is working. We are seeing prices stabilising, more places being made available in school nurseries and a revival in childminding. We want parents to have a good choice of options, including nurseries, schools, childminders and children staying at home with parents, or a combination of those. We are introducing much simpler funding and creating a regulatory structure to support modern working parents.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130.2/4">We are determined to reverse the decline in the number of childminders. From this September, good and outstanding childminders will be able automatically to access funding for early education places for two, three and four-year-olds. That means that an additional 28,000 childminders will automatically be funded. I think that addresses the point raised by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40290" name="Meg Hillier">the hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> about ensuring high-quality childminding.</p>

	<p pid="d.1130.4/1">That is a continuation of the fall in the number of childminders under Labour. We have reversed the policy, starting this September, and the Department for Education is already getting a lot of positive calls from childminders who are keen to offer early education places. There is a great deal of support for that; it helps parents to combine their child care and early education requirements. From this September, we</p>
	<p pid="d.1130.4/2">are trialling childminder agencies, which will enable more childminders to join the profession, and they will be fully up and running in September 2014. They will provide training and support, and will be an easy way for parents to access home-based care. We are at the beginning of making significant changes to the way childminders are regarded in our system. What we want to see is an increase in independent childminders and more agency childminders, as well.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130.4/3">We want to expand the level of school-based care, too. As opposed to Labour&#8217;s child care mirage, we are allowing real schools to offer real facilities. We are encouraging schools to use their nursery facilities to offer full-time day care rather than just be open for part of the day. We are allowing schools automatically to register two-year-olds, and I saw some brilliant provision for two-year-olds at the Oasis school in Hadley, which opened in January.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130.4/4">We are seeing 8-to-6 schools blossoming. The Norwich free school has a squirrels club, which means it is open from 8 am to 6 pm, 51 weeks a year. I know that the shadow Education Secretary thinks that free schools are a &#8220;dangerous ideological experiment&#8221;, but I think schools like the Norwich free school are giving hard-working parents the support that they need.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130.4/5">Another example is the Harris chain of academies, which has promised that every new school it opens will operate on an 8-to-6 basis. I am hugely in favour of 8-to-6 provision. It supports working families and helps to increase children&#8217;s attainment, but we must do that in a way that is realistic and sustainable for schools. That means making the necessary regulatory changes, aligning the requirements after the school day from within the school day and making it easier for schools to collaborate with outside providers. We do not get anywhere by making false promises that cannot be realised. We are also reforming child care funding so that parents see more of their money, rather than see it wasted. This means that all working parents will get up to &#163;1,200 per child towards child care costs and the provision of 15 hours for three and four-year-olds.</p>
	<p pid="d.1130.4/6">All that is in the context of what the Government are doing to help families with the cost of living: a &#163;705 income tax cut, thanks to our increases in the personal allowance; a &#163;1,000 saving on mortgages because rates have been kept low; &#163;364 saved on petrol for those who top up their cars once a week; and &#163;210 saved thanks to our council tax freeze. This Government have real policies, helping real working parents to manage their lives&#8212;not the dodgy numbers, unfunded promises and gimmicks we have seen from the Labour party today.</p>

	<p pid="d.1132.2/1">I will take your guidance, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am the father of a two-year-old toddler and now a two-week-old baby girl, as well, so perhaps I should declare an interest. <i>[Interruption.] </i>My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40148" name="Kevin Brennan">the Member for Cardiff West (Kevin Brennan)</phrase> asks me their names. My two girls are called Gracie and Annie, but enough about my family; let me move on to the substance of the debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1132.2/2">Investment in child care is one of the most important sets of investment that any Government can make. I think it was my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40691" name="Lucy Powell">the Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell)</phrase> who made the point a few weeks ago in one of the many articles she writes that we often talk about the importance of infrastructure investment&#8212;very topical at the moment, given the controversies over High Speed 2&#8212;and that child care should be viewed as an infrastructure investment. I entirely agree. Investment in child care is good not only for our future economic capacity, but for our children. That is what I shall focus on in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="d.1132.2/3">There is a general debate about how to raise the trend rate of growth in this country and how to rebalance the economy. We also debate how, if growth happens, it should be shared fairly and not snaffled away by the privileged few, as seems to be happening under this Government. Investment in child care must be an absolutely central part of building the economy of the future that we all want to see. I consider it to be one of the best social and economic investments that we can make. However, today I want to emphasise the benefits that it has for children.</p>
	<p pid="d.1132.2/4">I am sure all Members will agree that learning begins at birth. The first few years of a child&#8217;s life are critical to its development. Children need a stimulating, caring environment: they need opportunities to interact, to be talked to, to play, and to explore in safe surroundings. While I entirely accept that academic researchers differ on what is the right balance for a child between being in child care and being at home and that there are different conclusions to be drawn, it is undeniable that good-quality, affordable child care is central to a child&#8217;s development.</p>
	<p pid="d.1132.2/5">Both Front Benchers mentioned Baroness Morgan&#8217;s observations on preparing children for school. Academic evidence suggests that children who have experienced child care are much further ahead when it comes to development and readiness for school, but we also know that child care gives society an equality dividend. It helps women, in particular, to move into the labour market, but all too often they are priced out of that market by the cost of child care.</p>
	<p pid="d.1132.2/6">Ministers boast about the state of the economy, and say that we have turned the corner. Some top Tories even claim that they are on the glide path to victory,</p>
	<p pid="d.1132.2/7">which I would describe as a brave and, indeed, arrogant prediction. In reality, however, the economic benefits that exist are not being shared. There is a huge squeeze on living standards, and hard-working people are worse off and therefore cannot afford child care. We know from the figures that 2 million children in poverty live in households containing a single earner, and that nine out of 10 of the workless partners are female. Securing good-quality, affordable child care and helping mothers to return to the labour market is one of the best ways in which we can make a significant dent in child poverty numbers. But what is the record of the present Government?</p>
	<p pid="d.1132.2/8">As the Minister knows, I have tremendous respect for her. I listen carefully to her speeches, and read a great deal of what she says. However, the fact remains that the cost of nursery places has risen by 30%, and Ofsted figures show that there are 35,000 fewer child care places. The average bill for a part-time nursery place providing 25 hours a week has risen to &#163;107. Breakfast clubs have been scaled down, and the cost of summer holiday child care places has passed the &#163;100-a-week mark for the first time ever. Although all the academic research tells us of the advantages enjoyed by children and toddlers who have been exposed to books, the Secretary of State&#8212;who likes to think of himself as a champion of academic rigour&#8212;has halved the Bookstart grant.</p>
	<p pid="d.1132.2/9">The Government have implemented a range of policies that affect mothers. For instance, they have cut the child care element of working tax credit: a total of &#163;7 billion has been cut from working parents&#8217; tax credit. In two months&#8217; time, many of the higher-earning parents whose child benefit is being clawed away will have the taxman knocking on their doors because of the Government&#8217;s woeful handling of the situation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1132.2/10">Perhaps the Government&#8217;s worst act of vandalism against early-years provision is the fact that there are 578 fewer Sure Start centres. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40581" name="Tristram Hunt">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt)</phrase> quoted what the Prime Minister said before the last election, but as the Tories have taken it off their website, it is worth quoting again. He said that we were scaremongering. He said that the Government would back Sure Start. He said that it was &#8220;a disgrace&#8221; that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> was &#8220;trying to frighten people&#8221;. The fact remains, however, that we have 578 fewer Sure Start centres. The Tories can take that quotation off their website, like some Bolshevik politburo apparatchik trying to doctor photographs, but we will continue to remind the British people that the Prime Minister promised to maintain Sure Start centres, and that under his Government we are losing them.</p>

	<p pid="d.1133.0/1">My hon. Friend is making a very important point about the breaking of the promises made by the Prime Minister at the last general election.

	<p pid="d.1134.1/1">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase>, who speaks on Treasury matters, shouts &#8220;No, she won&#8217;t.&#8221; I think that that deals with the hon. Lady&#8217;s point.</p>
	<p pid="d.1134.1/2">I gather that the child care voucher companies will manage the Minister&#8217;s proposed scheme, but I do not know whether they will manage it for free. I should be interested to know what estimates the Department has made. How much will it cost the voucher companies to administer the scheme, and how much of the &#163;1.5 billion that the Minister is putting into the tax-free scheme will be creamed off?</p>
	<p pid="d.1134.1/3">The Minister&#8217;s big plan was to downgrade child care ratios. I remember the pamphlet that she wrote about that before she was appointed. At the time, a woman stopped me to complain about it while I was doing my shopping in Morrisons in the centre of Leicester. We know that, all too often, the Government&#8217;s answer to the challenges of globalisation is a race to the bottom, but what the Minister proposed would have put downward pressure on quality in the child care sector. I hope that she has now listened to campaigners, and does not plan to return to that proposal.</p>
	<p pid="d.1134.1/4">Tory spin doctors used to brief that the solution to the problem of a lack of affordable high-quality child care was the holy grail of policy, but we do not hear that so much nowadays. Regrettably, they are now briefing against the Minister. I read in Ben Brogan&#8217;s daily briefing the other day that they like to watch her &#8220;like a hawk&#8221;, and I read in <i>Total Politics </i>magazine that they like to keep her &#8220;on a tight leash&#8221;. Such briefing is nasty and unfair: that is no way to treat a Minister who is trying to develop better child care policies, although I disagree with the direction in which she is heading. However, I am afraid that it will fall to my hon. Friends the Members for Stoke-on-Trent Central and for Manchester Central to clear up the Minister&#8217;s mess, and implement a child care policy that will give hard-working mums and dads in my constituency the support that they so desperately need.</p>

	<p pid="d.1134.2/1">All parents want the best for their child&#8217;s early years. They want a safe, stimulating and secure environment, an environment that provides the best possible foundation for the child&#8217;s future success at school and in life. I do not think we should forget that, for many parents, that means early years at home with mother or father; but for many others who, like me, are working full or part time, it means relying on child care. What we all want is the best-quality child care, which will promote the best possible development for our children in those early years. It is not just</p>
	<p pid="d.1134.2/2">parents who are committed to that; the Government are absolutely committed to supporting families by providing quality child care, to meeting the costs of that care, and, importantly, to meeting parents&#8217; need for flexible child care choices in an era of increasingly flexible work.</p>
	<p pid="d.1134.2/3">I speak from considerable experience. During my working life, I have probably accessed every possible type of child care: a small private nursery, a pre-school nursery attached to my son&#8217;s state school, a childminder, family support, after-school clubs and breakfast clubs&#8212;and dad helped. I received wonderful support from friends, neighbours, and families whom I knew from church. However, I knew what it took to make that work for my children: it took an enormous amount of co-ordination. Without the network of support that I was fortunate enough to have, many families struggle. That is why it is so important for us to give as much support as we can to families and parents who want to work.</p>

	<p pid="d.1135.0/1">One of the sources of that kind of family support, which a quarter of families depend on, is grannies or grandparents. I am sad that we have not heard in this debate about how we are going to help working grandmothers cope. There was a study by a building society a couple of years ago which pointed out that grandparents save the taxpayer about &#163;4,000 a year through every piece of child care they offer.</p>

	<p pid="d.1135.1/1">The hon. Lady is absolutely right, and we should pay tribute to grandparents. I was very fortunate in having four wonderful grandparents without whom I could not have developed the business I did develop in those early years, when I could not have afforded the quality of child care that I could, perhaps, have afforded in later years. It is important that we strengthen family life, and I will come on to talk about some of the initiatives we need to put in place to support family life more widely. Many people cannot access that in their locality, however.</p>

	<p pid="d.1135.2/1">I am sure my hon.

	<p pid="d.1135.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for making that point because I was going to discuss the extensive provision that this Government are promoting for flexible working. As an employer, I have been able to accommodate some of the flexibility young mothers need, even when they perhaps just want to start work at 9.15 rather than 9. That can make an enormous difference to family life by enabling there to be good care and a good start to the day for very young children.</p>
	<p pid="d.1135.3/2">I was very fortunate that when my two boys were young we had a wonderful childminder, who is still very much a friend of the family. They still refer to her as &#8220;Auntie Pam.&#8221; Auntie Pam cared for my boys for two days a week. It is a tragedy that between 1996 and 2010 under the previous Government the number of childminders &#8212;the number of auntie Pams&#8212;dropped from 103,000 to 57,000. This Government are addressing that.</p>

	<p pid="d.1136.0/1">Does my hon.

	<p pid="d.1136.1/1">That is absolutely right, and I am glad to have this chance to put on record that it is a profession that deserves respect. Many childminders do not want the burdens of having to set up and run their own business. They do not want to have the burdens of complying with regulations and training requirements; they simply want to care for children. Let us release them and set them free to do that by supporting this new initiative of childminder agencies that the Government are setting up.</p>

	<p pid="d.1136.3/1">I am going to make some progress now; I have taken several interventions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1136.3/2">The Government&#8217;s childminder agency initiative is an excellent step, not least because it will mean that families will have a local resource that they can access to find a childminder they can have confidence in&#8212;a childminder who has been through the appropriate training, and who is from an agency that they know is maintaining proper standards. The agencies will also provide for occasions when the childminder falls ill, which can cause a great deal of stress to parents; there will be additional cover to provide someone else at short notice when they need that.</p>
	<p pid="d.1136.3/3">The Government&#8217;s provisions to build up the number of childminders should be supported, therefore, and the agencies will also help to promote take-up of Government funding for two to four-year-olds. At present fewer than 10% of childminders are funded through Government funding. I am sure that a lot of early-year place provision is being missed out as a result of that.</p>
	<p pid="d.1136.3/4">I support the Government&#8217;s proposals. They will enable childminders to concentrate on delivering high-quality education and care, which is what they want to do, and not be driven out of their profession simply because they do not want to face the regulations and red tape they have had to deal with until now. They will be able to benchmark themselves against the highest standards. They will be able to access the new framework of training and support and ongoing improvement, and concentrate on giving the best provision to families.</p>
	<p pid="d.1136.3/5">We should remind ourselves of the support that the Government are giving families in meeting the costs of child care. Some 70% of the child care costs of those on tax credits are covered by the Government and an additional &#163;200 million of support for lower-income families will be available within universal credit from April 2016, to take the proportion to 85%. Parents of all three and four-year-olds can access free child care. As we have heard, the Government have increased early education for three and four-year-olds from 12.5 hours a week to 15 hours a week so that what amounted to 475 hours a year of free child care in September 2010 now increases to 570 hours a year. I certainly would have greatly appreciated that when my boys were younger.</p>
	<p pid="d.1136.3/6">The Government are extending the offer of 15 hours a week of early education to two-year-olds from low-income families, which will benefit about 260,000 two-year-olds</p>
	<p pid="d.1136.3/7">from September 2014, costing &#163;760 million a year by the end of this Parliament. Just four weeks into this Government&#8217;s scheme that offers free child care to the most disadvantaged two-year-olds, 92,000 children are already benefiting, which is a huge increase on the 20,000 two-year-olds who accessed early education in 2010. Looking at share of GDP, this Government are spending &#163;5 billion on early-years child care and are spending more than 40% above the OECD average on child care for children under three.</p>
	<p pid="d.1136.3/8">The early-intervention grant replaces a number of centrally directed grants in supporting services for children and young people and families. It has allowed local authorities greater flexibility and freedom at the local level. I want to highlight some of the ways the local authorities in my area have used that funding to support a wide range of services for children, young people and families. There is targeted mental health support for young children through the charity Visyon in my constituency, of which I am a patron, and additional support is being given for fostering and adoption&#8212;and I pay tribute to the Under-Secretary, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40189" name="Edward Timpson">the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr Timpson)</phrase>, my constituency neighbour, who has done excellent work in increasing take-up in Cheshire.

	<p pid="d.1137.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow that at times very personal speech from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40182" name="Fiona Bruce">the hon. Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)</phrase>, but I want to pick up on one thing she said, which I think caused a little concern on the Opposition Benches. She talked about regulation of childminders in a way that gave us&#8212;and people watching on television, I suspect&#8212;the impression that all such regulation is a bad thing. Surely she is not suggesting that, for example, CRB checks should not be done? I caution Members on the Government Benches about the language they sometimes use in talking about regulation, as it can give a wholly misleading impression.</p>

	<p pid="d.1137.3/1">Speaking as someone who has started and who runs a small business, I can tell the hon. Gentleman that it is often extremely difficult to know what the regulations are. The fear of non-compliance can deter many people from starting a business in the first place. The agencies will give childminders reassurance that they are complying with the regulations. That is the big difference.</p>

	<p pid="d.1137.4/1">I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention. I am sure that everyone on both sides of the House agrees on the need to cut unnecessary regulation, but I stand by the point I just made.</p>
	<p pid="d.1137.4/2">It is a pleasure for me to follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40686" name="Jonathan Ashworth">the Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)</phrase>, who marked his return to the House with an impassioned speech. The increased relaxation that being in the House of Commons can provide to someone who is the father of two very young children has immediately given him a boost, and he brought that into his speech today.</p>
	<p pid="d.1137.4/3">When the cost of child care rockets, something has to give. For some, it is the opportunity to work, but those mums and dads who choose to stay in work try hard to ensure that they are the ones who bear the brunt of the cuts. They often stop going out, and they hold off from buying things for themselves that, in happier times, they would not think twice about buying. I should like Members to listen to one of the testimonies given to the Furness Poverty Commission, a body that I set up to look into the increasing deprivation in Barrow-in-Furness. A 34-year-old mother from my constituency told the commissioners that she was</p>
	<p pid="d.1137.4/4">&#8220;constantly worrying if the bills are all going to be paid, sometimes not having money for food, not ever being able to afford to get away anywhere, not being able to afford to secure your home, broken locks, no insurance&#8230;having to sell things to afford Christmas and not to be able to afford heating.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1137.4/5">Stories such as hers are all too common in Furness and right across the country.</p>

	<p pid="d.1138.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. The evidence is not only anecdotal; it is very real when we look at the figures. Is he aware that the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that, at the current rate, there will be more than 1 million additional children in poverty by 2020? Does it not appear that the country is going in the wrong direction for our children and our future?</p>

	<p pid="d.1138.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is making some powerful points about poverty. Does he accept that work is one of the best ways out of poverty? Does he also welcome the fact that, when universal credit is rolled out in his constituency, child care will be supported for the first hour of work for the individual whom he so eloquently described?</p>

	<p pid="d.1138.3/1">Work is important in many ways, not simply as a means of getting an income. There are some real questions about universal credit, but if the hon. Lady will forgive me, I will not go into that now.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138.3/2">Privately, my constituents sometimes share with me their sense of guilt and frustration when the strain is so great that they just cannot shield their children from the cuts they are having to make. Swimming lessons go, trips to the zoo are put off, and when nothing beyond the bare nutritional minimum goes into their child&#8217;s lunchbox, they worry that their child is not going to eat enough because they are not giving them what they really like or want. These are working people. They have made the choice to go out and hold down a job, and to juggle work and family life. They do not expect handouts. They know that life will not be easy when they choose to bring up kids, but they just ask for a bit of help with</p>
	<p pid="d.1138.3/3">what can seem like the suffocating burden of rising living costs. Child care should be one of the things that lift the strain on families and give them a way out of poverty; it should not add to the burden.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138.3/4">One of key recommendations of the Furness Poverty Commission on dealing with social and economic exclusion in Barrow and Furness was to close the gap that local people had identified in affordable and flexible child care. It is great that the number of children under the age of four in England is increasing, and I am pleased to have been able to do my bit on that front in recent years. So I am delighted by Labour&#8217;s plans, which my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40581" name="Tristram Hunt">the Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt)</phrase> has set out, to increase the availability of affordable child care. I am especially pleased that the extra entitlement will come in the form of wraparound care from 8 am to 6 pm.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138.3/5">Increasing child care from 15 to 25 hours a week could make a real difference to many families in my constituency. For many parents, it would make the difference between being able to work and not being able to do so. The provision of 12.5 or 15 hours has been a help but it has often not provided a trigger given the way in which the need for child care is spread out if parents rearrange their lives to go back to work. I believe that this wraparound care, aligning child care with the standard working day, will be revolutionary in helping parents to get back to work.</p>
	<p pid="d.1138.3/6">Like my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester South, I have a great deal of respect for the Under-Secretary of State for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40560" name="Elizabeth Truss">the hon. Member for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth Truss)</phrase>. I was therefore disappointed to hear her dismiss the wraparound child care guarantee in the way she did. She did not want to take my intervention earlier, but I have to tell her that one of the main problems is that there is often no provision at all for families&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="d.1139.1/1">The Minister shakes her said and says that that is not true, but I invite her to come to my constituency and see the problems that many people face when trying to arrange that kind of wraparound child care.</p>
	<p pid="d.1139.1/2">Working parents in my constituency&#8212;and in those of many of my hon. Friends&#8212;know how hard it can be to find affordable child care, or indeed any form of child care, to cover the period before the beginning of the formal school day and the hour or so at the end of it. Effectively, they are trying to find someone to care for their children and walk them to and from school. That might comprise only an hour of care, but an inability to find it can present an impenetrable barrier to getting back to work. This is why our plans could make a real difference. If we are serious about a sustained recovery that is shared by everyone across the country, we need to tackle the child care crisis head on. If this Government will not do that effectively, the next Labour Government will.</p>

	<p pid="d.1139.2/1">It is a great pleasure to speak in the debate, and to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40058" name="John Woodcock">the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="d.1139.2/2">It is also a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40686" name="Jonathan Ashworth">the hon. Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)</phrase>, who gave us the great news that his wife had recently given birth to a beautiful daughter.</p>
	<p pid="d.1139.2/3">It was also interesting to listen to the beginning of the debate. I thought that the Under-Secretary of State for Education, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40560" name="Elizabeth Truss">the Member for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth Truss)</phrase> was able to truss up like a turkey the shadow Education Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40581" name="Tristram Hunt">the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt)</phrase>, by putting up a good defence of the Government&#8217;s record and exposing the issues involved. [Hon. Members: &#8220;Oh!&#8221;] I can assure the House that the jokes do not get better than that.</p>
	<p pid="d.1139.2/4">Of course, child care is an issue not only for mothers; both parents should and do play a full role in the care of their children. They, and people without children, such as me, recognise that access to good quality child care is key. We should also celebrate the fact that more women are working than ever before.</p>

	<p pid="d.1140.1/1">I fully recognise that, too. What matters is that we should be allowing people to choose what they do. It is right to say that we should not condemn people who decide not to work in an external job and to focus their time on caring for their children at home.</p>
	<p pid="d.1140.1/2">The Minister referred to a number of cases where there has been concern about statistics being bandied about. Everyone in this House, however, would agree that one of the worst situations for a parent is when they need emergency child care, as occurs when teachers go on strike and parents are left trying to get time off work. It would be welcome if Labour Members condemned the decision of teaching unions to go on strike at irregular intervals, so that we can make sure that children are in school. The Minister referred to the fact that we are starting to remove red tape, so no longer will schools have to have a separate Ofsted registration when they cater for children under three years of age&#8212;that is to be welcomed. We are also dealing with aspects of planning and other requirements that restrict schools and deter them from facilitating child care provision outside the core school hours. It is important that we make it as straightforward as possible for existing school buildings to be used, be it by the school or not. I understand the wraparound guarantee to which the Opposition refer but, as has been pointed out, no extra funding is being provided for that&#8212;indeed, Opposition Members suggest that the funding has already been built into the formula grant.</p>
	<p pid="d.1140.1/3">One thing that does matter is having extra flexibility and choice. I also appreciate the commendation made by Ministers to ensure that schools do not just keep contracting their opening hours, as that, too, causes problems for parents trying to juggle work with getting their children to school. Some schools in my constituency have tried to do that and were still not listening after a consultation. Fortunately, however, when I sent them their communications from the Secretary of State, they realised that they should, of course, be considering the</p>
	<p pid="d.1140.1/4">wider issues for working families. So I am glad that in the particular school I am thinking about the decision was reversed by the governing body.</p>
	<p pid="d.1140.1/5">Let me deal with other aspects of removing red tape or increasing the number of places. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40182" name="Fiona Bruce">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)</phrase> eloquently referred to the issue of childminder agencies, which will be introduced. That is a good innovation to allow more people to put themselves forward to offer child care, and that is very welcome. In addition, childminders who are rated &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;outstanding&#8221; will be able to be funded directly from government, as opposed to the money being routed through the local council. That is a good step forward and, again, it removes the administration or other extra bureaucracy that stops government funding &#8212;we must remember that more than &#163;5 billion is being spent by this Government on early years education and child care.</p>

	<p pid="d.1141.0/1">Will my hon. Friend join me in congratulating North Yorkshire county council on its work? Not only has it managed to preserve the number of Sure Start children&#8217;s centres in my constituency, but I had the pleasure of opening one last year; we have actually increased the number of Sure Start centres.</p>

	<p pid="d.1141.1/1">I indeed join my hon. Friend in congratulating North Yorkshire county council and I will also give a boost to Suffolk&#8217;s council, as one Sure Start centre has opened in my constituency since the general election, and that is to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="d.1141.1/2">That takes me neatly on to the issue of Sure Start centres&#8212;or children&#8217;s centres, as they have become. A lot of figures are being bandied around about how many have closed. I have a regular correspondent on Twitter who assures me that the figure is now more than 700, whereas the Opposition tell us that it is more than 500. We have heard from the Minister today that fewer than 50 have closed. I will not pretend that I have had the time to go through all the different links and go into detail about the different numbers, but I am assured by what she has said at the Dispatch Box. Our Prime Minister said that he wanted to counter scaremongering, and we should not always get hung up about the buildings; it is about what matters for the child.</p>

	<p pid="d.1142.0/1">I agree with my hon. Friend, who makes the point I was referring to. Whether we are talking about Sure Start centres, children&#8217;s centres or many other public sector services, we should not get hung up solely on bricks and mortar; we should be focused on the outcomes for children, as that is what really matters.</p>
	<p pid="d.1142.0/2">I also wish to praise another local scheme in my constituency, Home-Start, which also operates around the country. I am particularly impressed with what it is doing to try to reach people, many of whom are not going to children&#8217;s centres to access services. It is taking the service to people in their homes, and giving help without it being seen as being judgmental&#8212;instead, it is seen as friendly. These are the kinds of initiatives we should be supporting. We should be allowing local councils to use their discretion and initiative to focus on what works best in their area, rather than solely implementing an idea from Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="d.1142.0/3">Opposition Members have said that their proposals will be funded through the bank levy&#8212;I appreciate that they are not talking about a bankers&#8217; bonus measure, which may have been discussed earlier. The shadow Secretary of State mentioned that less tax is coming in. He might have noticed that some of our largest banks have not been making a profit. The obvious cause is the global recession, but the previous Administration allowed the financial disasters to emerge: they allowed RBS to grow without any particular controls; HBOS was forced together with Lloyds, and similar other things occurred; and we had the disasters at the Co-op which have been revealed in the past few works. The Opposition are trying to suggest that a recovery in financial services is bad and that we need to tax them and, indeed, the people who work in them, further to pay for more and more schemes; the bankers&#8217; bonus tax seems to have been used 11 times to pay for various schemes that Labour Members cite. The reality is that money does not grow on trees&#8212;we all got taught that lesson when we were children&#8212;and we have to make every penny stretch. I am very proud that this Government have genuine ambitions for world-class child care. We know that at this moment in time the coverage is patchy and it is costing more than it should, but I am very supportive of the moves we are making to ensure that child care becomes a significant contributor to growth and to the growth of the family.</p>

	<p pid="d.1142.1/3">Asda survey reveals the startling picture that seven out of 10 mums said that they would be worse off if they went back to work because of the costs of child care. Any Government should take such a matter extremely seriously. Many families are caught in the poverty trap. Although they work all the hours they can, only one person can work because of the costs of child care. As a result they are struggling with the ever-rising cost of living, which is the reality for families up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.1142.1/4">Fewer women are in work in this country compared with many of our leading competitor countries, so we need to take the matter seriously. At the same time, women are paying three times more than men to reduce the deficit, yet they earn less and own less than men.</p>
	<p pid="d.1142.1/5">I am not just talking about supporting parents with the costs of child care, it is also important to ensure that child care places exist. Children and families in Newcastle are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the Government&#8217;s cuts. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40550" name="Andrea Leadsom">The hon. Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom)</phrase> raised the issue of the Sure Start centres and how we should measure their outcomes and not just bemoan their closure. None the less, their gradual disappearance is a serious loss and blow to every community.</p>

	<p pid="d.1143.0/1">This is an incredibly important point about Sure Starts. I am chair of the all-party parliamentary group on Sure Start, and we have just done a year-long inquiry into best practice in Sure Starts. Our conclusion is that there is absolutely no wholesale closure of the centres. In fact, lots more are opening. The Sure Starts that exist are really focusing on outcomes and on getting in better services for families. I wish that Opposition Members would stop suggesting to families that the support they need in those early years is disappearing; it is just not. There is no evidence for that.</p>

	<p pid="d.1143.3/1">It is clear that the Government are using figures to manipulate the reality that is being reported by constituents up and down the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.1143.3/2">Let me get back to the situation in Newcastle. Last year, my local authority, in the light of unprecedented funding challenges, consulted on a three-year budget for the period 2013-16. When it began the process, it believed that, as a result of funding reductions from the Government and rising cost pressures from inflation, high energy prices and the costs of providing services to</p>
	<p pid="d.1143.3/3">an ever-ageing population, it faced a funding shortfall of &#163;90 million over three years. That figure rose during the consultation process to &#163;100 million. Following further cuts announced in the autumn statement and the local government finance settlement, it is now facing cuts of &#163;108 million. It has already announced the closure of Sure Start centres in my constituency&#8212;all of them&#8212;and because of the additional funding requirement and shortfall, it has now put all 20 Sure Start centres within the Newcastle city council area under review, so we do not know what their future will be.</p>

	<p pid="d.1144.0/1">Does my hon.

It is wrong to pretend otherwise.</p>

	<p pid="d.1144.1/1">The Department for Education&#8217;s children&#8217;s centre database on the gov.uk website shows that there are 3,053 centres whereas the DFE website shows that there were 3,632 Sure Start centres in 2010. The number of Sure Start centres, in the form in which communities recognise and value them, is reducing and the Department&#8217;s figures show that. It would be an appalling situation if Sure Start was just about providing affordable child care&#8212;we know that the Government have a great challenge on their hands to meet their obligations in that regard&#8212;but it is not. Sure Start also provides vital support services to young children and families, who are some of the most vulnerable and hardest to reach in our communities, by providing parenting advice, breastfeeding support, affordable child care or just an opportunity for isolated and often vulnerable and frustrated new mothers and fathers to meet up with other people.</p>
	<p pid="d.1144.1/2">Another huge concern is the impact that Sure Start closures would have on the preventive early intervention work that stops children and families entering the child protection system. I know that the children&#8217;s Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40189" name="Edward Timpson">the hon. Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr Timpson)</phrase>, cares about this matter, and I would be grateful if, in his winding-up speech, he commented on the consideration the Government have given to that impact on our child protection system. At present, about 50% of the looked-after children in Newcastle are in the local authority&#8217;s care as a result of domestic violence in their home.</p>

	<p pid="d.1144.2/1">The hon. Lady is making a very good case for children&#8217;s centres, with which I completely agree. Would she not acknowledge, however, that despite the changes that she is saying are so detrimental, more than 1 million people are now accessing the centres, as are two thirds of the most disadvantaged families with children under five&#8212;a record number?</p>

	<p pid="d.1144.3/1">I appreciate what the hon. Gentleman is saying, but I am talking about the future, too, and putting on the record my concerns about further closures of Sure Start centres. I agree that it is positive that more families use them, but the worry is that they will disappear as the local authority cuts that have not even started yet have an impact. Both Under-Secretaries should be worried about the impact on their own figures and work.</p>
	<p pid="d.1144.3/2">The long-term costs of the closure of Sure Start centres must be considered in the wider context. I have seen first hand the work that my local Sure Start centres, which are already earmarked for closure, do with vulnerable women and men in cases of domestic violence. That work is vital if more children are not to be taken into care in future.</p>
	<p pid="d.1144.3/3">The holistic approach to supporting children and young families across the country developed under Labour is, in my view, under threat from the action taken by a Government who seem incredibly out of touch, who just do not get it and who just do not care. That will only result in higher costs in the long term for society and for public services at every level.</p>

	<p pid="d.1145.2/1">For me, as for many people in the Chamber and up and down the country, child care is not an academic issue but something we grapple with every single day of the year, including today. I believe that child care is an area of public policy that, if we get it right, can transform the lives of millions and build a stronger economy. I think that so far I would have cross-party agreement.</p>
	<p pid="d.1145.2/2">I know that it is fashionable for some members of my party to apologise for things that Labour did in office, but we should make no apology whatsoever for what Labour did on child care. Our record is incredibly strong. Labour introduced the free entitlement to 15 hours a week of child care for every three and four-year-old in the country and Labour introduced Sure Start. When I was out on the doorsteps as a candidate before 2005, Sure Start was a policy that mothers were talking to me about. It is very rare that voters talk to us about policies by name. It was exciting, it was progressive and it has made a difference.</p>
	<p pid="d.1145.2/3">The three and four-year-olds coming through the system at the millennium are today 16 and 17, a generation of young people whose lives were enhanced under a Labour Government but are now blighted by the prospect of unemployment under the coalition Government. The latest evaluation of Sure Start, published by the Department for Education in June last year, showed many positive impacts of Sure Start on young children and their parents. The one I want to highlight is the greater improvement in life satisfaction among lone parents and workless households. We know that being unemployed is tough, and being a lone parent is one of the toughest things in the world. This programme demonstrably improved life satisfaction amongst those groups in our community. That is why we should be angry that Sure Start centres are closing or being watered down. Our blood should be boiling with indignation. Mine certainly is.</p>
	<p pid="d.1145.2/4">We should nail the myth about Sure Start centres. Some may still be open, but what range of services are they providing? Many are no longer providing child care. Others have been subsumed into their sponsoring school.</p>

	<p pid="d.1146.3/1">I regret not having the chance to debate, but I have three and a half minutes left&#8212;a very short time in what we thought would be a longer debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1146.3/2">The &#8220;pile them high, teach them cheap&#8221; policy promoted by the Under-Secretary of State for Education, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40560" name="Elizabeth Truss">the hon. Member for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth Truss)</phrase> is another example of the Government&#8217;s attitude to child care. I want to focus on three areas&#8212;first, that child care is not a peripheral issue, a soft issue or even a women&#8217;s issue. Quality child care goes to the heart of our society, our economy and our country&#8217;s prosperity. No policy matters more. As we see, with a squeeze on living standards throughout the country, people are looking at costs. We see the challenges.</p>
	<p pid="d.1146.3/3">For example, research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation shows that the cost of necessities required to give a child a decent standard of living increased by 4% in the past year alone. A recent OECD report found that the UK has some of the most expensive child care in the world. I will not repeat the arguments that colleagues have made, but we know that a further 1.3 million women want to work more hours. If our employment rate for mothers moved up to the average of the world&#8217;s top five nations, 320,000 more women would have jobs, and crucially tax receipts would rise by &#163;1.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="d.1146.3/4">Secondly, we need to bold. I urge those on my Front-Bench to be bolder even than they are being now. We should be proud of our record, but in the past progress was sometimes slower than it should have been. It was sometimes piecemeal. I do not speak for my Front Bench, but I would like to see a child care Bill in the first Queen&#8217;s Speech, announcing our aim to move towards universal child care. The Institute for Public Policy Research think tank has shown that a decent universal system of child care pays for itself in the long run. More parents working, paying taxes and not claiming tax credits and benefits more than pays for the state&#8217;s investment in child care. We know from Scandinavia that that increases women&#8217;s participation in the work force, so we need to be bold.</p>
	<p pid="d.1146.3/5">The third area that I have a brief moment to flag up, as I know we are running out of time, is the idea of sustainability and ownership. I am a proud co-operator, and there must be a greater role for co-op and mutual models when it comes to child care. Many of the original Sure Start centres were run by boards of parents. I worked among them as my own older children were growing up and saw the empowerment that that gave many of those women. These community assets should not be at the command of Ministers of any party. They remain under threat if Ministers do not care about child care. Parents know best. I would like to see more co-operative ownership, including childminding co-ops, rather than the agencies that the Government are</p>
	<p pid="d.1146.3/6">promoting, which would cream off a profit and remove the parent relationship with their own childminder, which would be a great mistake.</p>
	<p pid="d.1146.3/7">In my final minute, I give way to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40550" name="Andrea Leadsom">the hon. Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="d.1147.0/1">I just want to say that the hon. Lady is making a big mistake by turning child care into such a political issue. She knows as well as I do that Sure Start centres are doing brilliant work in our society. There is so much potential from the Sure Start movement. She should be proud that Labour introduced it and that this Government are building on it. Opposition Members should stop trying to frighten parents into thinking that it is all going pear-shaped.</p>

	<p pid="d.1147.1/1">But we know that services are being watered down. The great thing about Sure Start centres is that they were open to all and a range of services were provided. It was a one-stop shop. It will always be a challenge to decide what services should be provided when money is tight, but Sure Start was a great unifier, a great starting point, a great melting pot, a great mix. I am glad to hear from the hon. Member for South Northamptonshire that she is a champion of it on her Benches. It is a shame that the Government are not, and their funding cuts to local authorities are putting Sure Start under threat. I am not being partisan for the sake of it. Our record is strong, and parents and child carers in my constituency worry about their future under this Government.</p>

	<p pid="d.1147.2/1">I follow my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40290" name="Meg Hillier">the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> by agreeing with her about the cuts to Sure Start and the effect that that has had throughout the country. The Minister confirmed that the figures have fallen from 3,631 in 2010 to 3,053&#8212;a reduction of 578 in the number of Sure Start centres. That is the reality.</p>
	<p pid="d.1147.2/2">I take the Minister back to her evidence to the Education Committee in reply to a question from me on this subject. She did not deny that that was the situation. She claimed that, where the centres were still being used, they had moved to a hub and spoke model. We heard in evidence that sadly, far too often, instead of the delivery of the service, a part-time member of staff hands out leaflets, signposting parents to a service that may exist somewhere else. That is not the same thing as delivering the service that was there previously. That is what has happened with these closures. We have seen a drastic reduction in the quality of the service. When I asked about that in the Select Committee, the Minister ignored the point and moved on to something else. I have the transcript here if she wants to check what she said. She failed to give me an answer when I put that point to her. According to Government figures, 7,200 fewer staff work in Sure Start centres throughout the country. That has to mean a lower level and lower quality of service. I am sorry to say this, but that was the evidence given to the inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="d.1147.2/3">I am proud of our record on Sure Start. My son was three when he came to live with us, and we were fortunate in that the Sure Start centre where we used to live</p>
	<p pid="d.1147.2/4">opened about a week before then. It was linked to a school, so there was a nursery, and he benefited from the brilliant staff working there. We as a family benefited from the support of Sure Start. Talking to other parents there and to parents who used other Sure Start facilities, it was clear that Sure Start transformed their lives and the lives of the children who benefited from those services. It made an enormous difference to their development and school readiness. That could be seen when looking at older children who had benefited from going through that system and the quality of child care and support for families that resulted from what the last Labour Government did. The Labour party is right to be proud of our record on Sure Start. I have confirmed that with the Sure Start centres in my constituency. Having children who are school ready makes all the difference. In the deprived areas that I serve in Crosby, children whose parents have benefited from Sure Start are school ready while others from the same estates are not. There is a marked difference in school readiness and the outcomes that schools can achieve for those children.</p>
	<p pid="d.1147.2/5">The Select Committee went to Denmark earlier this year and looked at the Danish experience. That is the quality of care to which we should aspire. We do not spend as much as they do in Denmark or in a number of other countries, particularly those in Scandinavia, and that explains the difference. The Minister shakes her head, but her Department has produced a report, which was evidenced in the Select Committee, in which a thorough analysis of the figures showed that spending levels here are not on a par with those in Denmark, and that explains the difference overall.</p>

	<p pid="d.1148.1/1">Absolutely. The Government should look at their own officials&#8217; reports, as I was just saying in relation to the OECD comparisons.</p>
	<p pid="d.1148.1/2">The Government quite rightly want more women in the work force as a long-term driver of growth. In Denmark, 84% of working-age women are in work, whereas in the UK the figure is only 67.1%&#8212;we are rated 16th in the OECD in that regard. Denmark has wraparound care from 8 am to 5 pm, and from six months all the way up to age 10, and the maximum contribution an individual can make is 25%. There are highly qualified and well-trained professionals, mostly educated to relevant degree level, working in its child care settings. It is that massive level of support from the public purse that enables so many more women to go to work. They have a choice, of course, but many of them choose to take that opportunity. As a result, the system is supported by parents, politicians and the Danish equivalent of the CBI, so business likes that system.</p>
	<p pid="d.1148.1/3">My hon. Friends on the Front Bench are right to propose moving in that direction in the motion on the Order Paper, with wraparound care from 8 am to 6 pm. We certainly need to increase the number of hours in nurseries, so 25 hours is a great step in the right direction. We certainly need to follow the Danish system, and I hope that Members will support the motion.</p>

	<p pid="d.1149.0/1">I am grateful to the many colleagues across the House, especially so many male colleagues, who have spoken in this important debate. This is my first outing at the Dispatch Box, and I am absolutely delighted to be winding up on an issue of such importance to so many families across the country.</p>
	<p pid="d.1149.0/2">Labour has a proud record on child care. It was the Labour Government who put child care on the political map and oversaw a revolution in child care provision. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40290" name="Meg Hillier">the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> gave a passionate account of our record. Ensuring that we have good, affordable and flexible child care is critical not only for families facing a cost of living crisis, but for the economy as a whole, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40686" name="Jonathan Ashworth">the Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)</phrase> rightly said.</p>
	<p pid="d.1149.0/3">Unfortunately, things are going backwards under this Government. They are presiding over a child care crunch and failing to support families in work. Under this Government we have seen a child care triple whammy of rising costs, falling places and cuts in support to help parents. Since 2010 the number of child care places has fallen by over 35,000, including 2,423 fewer childminders on the Minister&#8217;s watch, all at a time when a rising birth rate is putting greater demand on the system. The failure to supply enough places is impacting on costs for families. The problem of insufficient child care supply is hurting the economy and making balancing work and family life a nightmare for parents.</p>
	<p pid="d.1149.0/4">Many Members have spoken about cuts to their local Sure Start centre. The Government&#8217;s own figures show that there are now 578 fewer centres than there were in 2010. That figure is calculated from the Government&#8217;s own publicly available records, and I must say that it resonates much more with what we hear is happening on the ground. Let us take the Prime Minister&#8217;s back yard as an example. Of the 44 centres in Oxfordshire, 37 are due to close. He once famously said that he would back Sure Start, but for many in his constituency that is yet another broken promise.</p>
	<p pid="d.1149.0/5">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40550" name="Andrea Leadsom">the hon. Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom)</phrase>&#8212;I have a great deal of respect for her and for the work she has done on early intervention&#8212;that the issue is not just about the fabric of the buildings; it is also about capacity. I wonder whether Ministers can tell us what progress is being made in increasing the number of health visitors by 4,200 by 2015, which is critical in delivering the Sure Start model.</p>
	<p pid="d.1149.0/6">The crisis in places is leading to price hikes that are making it increasingly unsustainable for parents to make ends meet, as the very powerful account from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40058" name="John Woodcock">the Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)</phrase> made clear.</p>

	<p pid="d.1149.1/1">Is the hon. Lady aware that Naomi Eisenstadt, who can be regarded as the mother of Sure Start, told the Education Committee that there were too many Sure Start centres and that phase 3 was spreading them far too thinly?</p>

	<p pid="d.1150.1/1">I will plough on and give way later.</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.1/2">Under this Government, average weekly part-time nursery costs have increased by 30%. Put another way, child care costs have risen five times faster than wages. In the past year alone, they have risen at more than double the rate of inflation. It is typical of the Government to pretend that things are going well when the reality is that many parents are finding it an incredible struggle to find and afford the child care they need. On top of the crisis in places and hikes in costs, parents have also seen their support fall. Families with two children have experienced a reduction of about &#163;1,500 a year in tax credits, hitting low-income families the hardest. At the time of the 2010 spending review, the Office for Budget Responsibility warned the Government that cuts to child care support would have a negative impact, saying that they would</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.1/3">&#8220;affect the hours worked and participation in the labour market&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.1/4">Yet the Government have taken no notice and parents face an increasingly difficult child care crunch.</p>

	<p pid="d.1150.3/1">I am going to make some progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/2">Let me turn to the Government&#8217;s response. They may have deleted reference to it from their website, but the Prime Minister once promised that they would be</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/3">&#8220;the most family-friendly Government&#8230;ever&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/4">Yet they have wasted three years doing very little. The Minister&#8217;s flagship agenda on ratios has been abandoned; the nursery offer for disadvantaged two-year-olds is being met with delivery problems; and their tax break scheme is too little, too late and benefits the richest the most. On child care ratios, the Deputy Prime Minister agreed with us that changing ratios could even increase prices. He said that the evidence was &#8220;overwhelmingly against&#8221; changing the rules on ratios, and went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/5">&#8220;I cannot ask parents to accept such a controversial change with no real guarantee it will save them money&#8212;in fact it could cost them more.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/6">While we welcome extra support for disadvantaged two-year-olds, one in three councils tell us that they do not have enough places to meet this policy.</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/7">Childminder agencies are up in the air, with no clarity about how they will work or what they will do. The Minister is running 20 pilots across the country. So far, we know that at least two of those pilots will charge, although we do not know who will bear the cost. Will Ministers give us a guarantee that childminder agencies will not push up prices for parents?</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/8">The Government&#8217;s tax-free child care policy is too little, too late for parents. The extra investment in child care the Government are promising is dwarfed by the &#163;7 billion a year of cuts they have already made for families with children. The scheme does not start until 2015, and it excludes families with children over the age of five. It benefits families earning up to &#163;300,000 a year, helping the richest the most while leaving low and middle-income families struggling to make work pay, particularly for second earners. This policy will do nothing about costs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/9">By contrast, Labour has a plan to tackle the child care crunch. Our policies will make a real difference to mums and dads, get our economy moving, and help parents to tackle the logistical nightmare they face. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase> rightly pointed out, seven out of 10 mums said they would work were it not for the high costs of child care. Expensive child care is acting as a drag on our economy. If our employment rate for mothers moved up to the average of the world&#8217;s top five nations, 320,000 more women would have jobs and tax receipts would rise by &#163;1.7 billion a year. The Government gloat about their record, but most of the jobs they have created for mothers returning to work are part-time, low-paid jobs. Over 1 million of those people want to return to full-time work, but the full-time jobs do not exist.</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/10">Labour Members take the child care crunch seriously; we are not as complacent as Government Members. We would expand free child care for three and four-year-olds from 15 to 25 hours per week for working parents. That is worth over &#163;1,500 a year. This is a fully costed Labour commitment. We would pay for this policy by ensuring that the banks pay their fair share, increasing the bank levy to an extra &#163;800 million a year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/11">For school-aged children, many parents increasingly struggle to find decent before and after-school child care. The Government abandoned our extended schools programme. We will set down in law a guarantee that parents can access wraparound child care through their local school if they want it. This will stimulate innovation and collaboration to meet the logistical nightmare described by Members today.</p>
	<p pid="d.1150.3/12">Child care is at the heart of the cost of living crisis for many families. While parents cry out for action from this Government, all we have seen is in-fighting and prevarication while costs have soared and provision fallen. Our offer of 25 hours free child care for working parents of three and four-year-olds will make a real difference to families struggling to make ends meet. I hope colleagues on both sides of the House will support our motion.</p>

	<p pid="d.1151.0/1">This has been a valuable debate that has brought into sharp focus the importance of the cost and availability of child care to so many parents across the country. I have listened with interest to the contributions made by Members on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/2">I add my congratulations to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40686" name="Jonathan Ashworth">the hon. Member for Leicester South (Jonathan Ashworth)</phrase> on the recent addition to his family. If he decides to expand it in the future, he will, of course, benefit from the provision for new flexible parental leave in our Children and Families Bill, which will come back before the House before too long. He spoke about the importance of high-quality, affordable child care, which is a baseline on which I think everyone who has taken part in the debate can form a consensus.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/3">My parliamentary neighbour, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40182" name="Fiona Bruce">the Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce)</phrase>, told us how her family had benefited from a range of choice and flexibility</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/4">with regard to child care, and about the importance of promoting strong family life and the role that childminder agencies could play in increasing both supply and choice.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40058" name="John Woodcock">The hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)</phrase> explained how child care can be a way out of poverty. I completely agree with him. That is why we have extended early-education funding to 260,000 two-year-olds from the lowest-income households. He may be pleased to hear that in Cumbria 805 children have already benefited directly from that policy.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/6">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40591" name="Therese Coffey">the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey)</phrase> made an excellent contribution. She reminded us that more women are working than ever before in this country and said how improving flexible access to quality child care will help push that figure even higher.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/7"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40421" name="Catherine McKinnell">The hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell)</phrase> started by saying that she disagreed with almost everything my hon. Friend said. I listened carefully to the hon. Lady&#8217;s speech and I, in turn, disagreed with almost everything she said, save for her very thoughtful consideration of children who are on the edge of, or who have fallen into, care and how child care may help support them. I would be very happy to discuss that with the hon. Lady outside this debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/8"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40290" name="Meg Hillier">The hon. Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier)</phrase> explained the wider benefits to society of good-quality, accessible child care, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40522" name="Bill Esterson">the hon. Member for Sefton Central (Bill Esterson)</phrase> told us about the Danish model that was considered recently as part of the inquiry held by his Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/9">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40550" name="Andrea Leadsom">the Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom)</phrase>, who is a champion for Sure Start children centres, also made a good contribution. I have read the report produced by the all-party group of which she and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40636" name="Sharon Hodgson">the hon. Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)</phrase> are members. It is an excellent analysis of the current state of affairs and well worth reading, and I recommend it to the Opposition&#8217;s Front Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/10">My hon. Friends the Members for Nuneaton (Mr Jones) and for Sherwood (Mr Spencer) also contributed to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/11">There is not doubt that child care costs have been a real problem for many families for too long. To be frank, that should not surprise us when figures from the Family and Childcare Trust show that between 2002 and 2010, child care costs increased by just under 50%. That is why the Government have been quick to act and taken a number of significant steps to reduce parents&#8217; child care bills and support those who want to work.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/12">In September 2010, we increased the free entitlement for all three and four-year-olds to 15 hours per week&#8212;the equivalent of 570 hours per year&#8212;and 96% of children are now getting at least part of their free place. From September 2014, that will be extended to about 260,000 two-year-olds, many of them from the working households on low incomes for whom the costs of child care are such a burden.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/13">As universal credit is introduced, parents working less than 16 hours per week will, for the first time, be able to get up to 70% of their child care costs paid. That will rise to 85% when both parents work enough to pay income tax, a point which was made by my hon. Friend</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/14">the Member for Congleton. From autumn 2015, we will begin to phase in tax-free child care, which will give 2.5 million working families up to &#163;1,200 per year per child.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/15">Taken together, that means that for three-year-olds in nursery for 40 hours a week, the state will pay for half of the hours for children whose parents claim tax-free child care, and more than 80% of the hours&#8212;four days out of five&#8212;for children whose parents claim universal credit. It also means that the Government spend on early education and child care will rise by more than &#163;1 billion from less than &#163;5 billion in 2010 to more than &#163;6 billion by 2015-16.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/16">We on the Government Benches know that simply providing ever-more funding will not, on its own, halt the long-term increase in child care costs, or provide the child care places that we need for the future. That can come only through growth in the market and improved competition.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/17">Contrary to the view expressed by Opposition Front Benchers, there is no shortage of child care places. Some Opposition Members read from their brief a claim that the closure of Sure Start children&#8217;s centres means that child care places have been lost. However, as the Under-Secretary of State for Education, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40560" name="Elizabeth Truss">the Member for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth Truss)</phrase> made clear several times, the Opposition&#8217;s rumours about the demise of children&#8217;s centres are very premature.</p>
	<p pid="d.1151.0/18">In fact, those centres are thriving, with a record number of more than 1 million parents and children using their services. Although they continue to provide such valuable services, it is important to remember that they provide only 1% of child care, as opposed to schools, which provide about 30% of it. In fact, the total number of child care settings rose from 87,900 in 2010 to 90,000 in 2011, which is a 2.4% overall increase.</p>

	<p pid="d.1153.0/1">Will the Minister tell me whether we imagined or made up the evidence given to the Education Committee inquiry on Sure Start about many centres just being used by part-time staff to hand out leaflets, because that is what the record shows? Is that not what is happening? Is that not the reality in the country?</p>

	<p pid="d.1153.1/1">The hon. Gentleman had the benefit of listening to that evidence. It would be strange for me to suggest that he did not listen to evidence that I did not listen to, so he has asked a slightly bizarre question. The bottom line is simply this: are we ensuring that money, support, training and a quality work force are available to parents who require child care? We are providing &#163;2.5 billion for early intervention, which is up from &#163;2.3 billion, and we are making sure that the money we put in equates to 2 million early-years places, including the 800,000 in maintained schools&#8212;the Opposition forgot to mention them in their rushed-out press release earlier this week&#8212;which is a 5% increase on 2009.</p>
	<p pid="d.1153.1/2">Local authorities report that there are already 180,000 places for two-year-olds across the country, which is more than sufficient for all eligible two-year-olds whose parents want to take up the offer. Just one month into the new entitlement, 92,000 disadvantaged two-year-olds are already receiving their 15 hours a week of early education, which is more than four times the number receiving funded places in 2010. I hope that hon. Members</p>
	<p pid="d.1153.1/3">on all sides recognise that that is a significant achievement not for us in this House, but for the children on whose lives there will be a positive impact.</p>
	<p pid="d.1153.1/4">We should, however, be acutely aware that more high-quality places are needed. Demographic changes, the expansion of the two-year-old entitlement, continued economic recovery and welfare reform will all increase demand for child care. That is why we are acting to create the right conditions for that to happen in every part of the market.</p>
	<p pid="d.1153.1/5">The evidence is clear that the quality of settings is determined above all by the quality of the work force. In &#8220;More Great Childcare&#8221;, my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary signalled our intention to create a step change in the quality of recruits coming into early-years education, and many of the report&#8217;s proposals are already in place.</p>
	<p pid="d.1153.1/6">The signs are promising both in relation to the cost of provision and maternal employment. One authoritative industry report published in September found that 2012-13 was the second successive year in which the price of full-day care in nurseries had been flat in real terms.</p>
	<p pid="d.1153.1/7">There are positive indications that the package of reforms that this Government have put into place, and which my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary has done so much to champion, are starting to have the desired impact of encouraging growth in every part of the child care market; placing a better trained and higher quality work force at the heart of child care provision; creating genuine choice for parents; and ensuring that, for hard-pressed parents, work really does pay. I encourage Members to vote against the motion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-19d.1159.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40048" speakername="Gloria De Piero" colnum="1159"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0003.htm#131119-0003.htm_spnew14">
	<p pid="d.1159.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="d.1159.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House believes that the Government is failing to deliver a recovery for women and is making women pay three times more than men to bring down the deficit, according to research by the House of Commons Library; notes that under this Government, women&#8217;s unemployment has reached its highest levels for a generation; further notes that wages are stagnating in jobs where women are predominant; and calls on the Government to support more women into decent work by extending free nursery places for 3 and 4 year olds from 15 to 25 hours a week for parents at work, provide a legal guarantee for 8am-6pm breakfast and afterschool club childcare, and bring in Make Work Pay contracts to provide a 12 months tax rebate for firms which sign up to pay the living wage.</p>
	<p pid="d.1159.1/3">The test of a successful economy is whether it improves the living standards of ordinary people: families and businesses who want to work hard and to get on. Today, official figures say that working people are on average &#163;1,600 per year worse off than they were at the election. On this Government&#8217;s watch, we have seen the biggest fall in workers&#8217; incomes in any G7 country. Families across the country are hurting and it is women who are on the front line of this cost of living crisis. More often than not, it is women who are left trying to make the family budget stretch that little bit further: when the weekly shop costs more each month, but the amount in the purse stays the same; when in the past three years the cost of keeping the kids in nursery has risen five times faster than wages; and when heating bills are 10% more expensive than they were last year. Women understand what it means for prices to rise faster than wages for 40 out of the past 41 months.</p>

	<p pid="d.1159.7/1">Those comments were absolutely offensive. I thank my hon. Friend for highlighting them, and for asking the question that exposed the reality of the Government&#8217;s position.</p>
	<p pid="d.1159.7/2">Women feel it when their Sure Start centres are cut and the cost of child care continues to rise. They understand that the Government are not doing enough to help them, and they could teach David Cameron a thing or two about tough decisions. The other week I met a different Chipping Norton set: Lisa, Amanda, Toni and Laetitia. Lisa told me that, as a new mum caring for a young child and a husband with cancer, the children&#8217;s centre in the Prime Minister&#8217;s constituency saved her from having a breakdown. That Sure Start centre is now threatened with closure. Sheila, in my constituency, is in her 80s. She is a widow living alone in Sutton-in-Ashfield, and is worried about how she is going to keep warm this winter. To do so, she has to spend the day at her son&#8217;s house. Half of mums surveyed by Netmums said that to save money they turn off the heating when their children are out. This is their Britain.</p>

	<p pid="d.1160.0/1">The hon. Lady is making a compelling case about how the Government&#8217;s misguided austerity programme is leading to social devastation and is economically illiterate. Does she agree that cutting public services hits women with a triple whammy&#8212;as the group most dependent on public services, as employees of public service and as the ones who have to fill the gap when public services go?</p>

	<p pid="d.1160.1/1">It is absolutely right that women are hit three times as hard, and I will explain later how that has happened.</p>
	<p pid="d.1160.1/2">Half of mums surveyed by Netmums said that to save money they turned off the heating when their children were out. The Government talk about recovery, but these women know it is definitely not a recovery for women. Under this Government, unemployment among women has reached its highest levels in a generation, long-term female unemployment has increased eight times as fast as for men, the number of older women unemployed has increased by more than a third, and black and minority ethnic women are twice as likely to be unemployed as the national average.</p>

	<p pid="d.1160.2/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that the 242% increase in unemployment among women over 25 in Oldham over the past couple of years is a real indictment of the Government and their policies?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="d.1160.3/1">That is absolutely right. That is why it is important to tackle long-term unemployment, and that is exactly what a Labour Government would do.</p>
	<p pid="d.1160.3/2">When women do manage to find work, more often than not it is part-time, low-wage or temporary. The number of women working in temporary jobs increased twice as fast as the number of men. Three times more young women are in low-wage jobs than 20 years ago, and the number of women in part-time work is at its highest level ever.</p>

	<p pid="d.1160.4/1">My hon. Friend is making a powerful speech.

	<p pid="d.1161.0/1">I absolutely agree. My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. I vividly remember one lady&#8212;a mum in her 40s&#8212;coming into my office just before a Morrisons opened in my constituency. She was in tears because when Morrisons announced it was recruiting, she kept calling but the number was constantly engaged.</p>

	<p pid="d.1161.1/1">My hon. Friend has already mentioned the problems for women over 50. Does she appreciate that for all women, but especially those over 50, unemployment has a huge impact on their capacity to retire and save for retirement? We are not just saying to women, &#8220;You&#8217;re not going to earn now&#8221;; we are blighting their lives with poverty into old age and with the need to apply for benefits in old age. If they were working now, they could save for their old age.</p>

	<p pid="d.1161.2/1">My hon. Friend makes a fantastic point.</p>
	<p pid="d.1161.2/2">What is the Government&#8217;s response? It is to hit women harder. Of the &#163;14.4 billion George Osborne has raised through direct taxation and benefit changes, about &#163;11.4 billion&#8212;79%&#8212;is coming from women. David Cameron is asking women to pay more than three times as much as men to bring down the deficit, despite the fact that women still earn and own less than men. Scratch the surface, and we see that some of the most vulnerable women are being hit.</p>

	<p pid="d.1161.6/1">Will my hon. Friend also highlight the impact of the cuts on the voluntary sector and therefore on women who use those services? The charity Women&#8217;s Aid said yesterday that domestic violence refuges had had to turn away 180 women a day, many of whom were going back to violent relationships. The impact on those women and their children will surely be immense.</p>

	<p pid="d.1161.7/1">That is an extremely powerful point. If as much has been cut from local government finance as this Government have cut, it shows the reality of what we see. If we scratch the surface, we see that some of the most vulnerable women have been the hardest hit. Low-paid new mums lost nearly &#163;3,000-worth of support during pregnancy and in their baby&#8217;s first year. Couples with children lost 9.7% of their disposable income and single mothers lost the most&#8212;15.6%. The Prime Minister just does not get it. Why would he, when only four out of the 22 in his Cabinet are women? When it comes to women, it is out of sight and out of mind from this out-of-touch Prime Minister.</p>

	<p pid="d.1162.0/1">Is the hon. Lady as delighted as I am that this Government have introduced shared parental leave and time off for dads to support their wives?

	<p pid="d.1162.1/1">We in government extended maternity leave and introduced paternity leave.</p>
	<p pid="d.1162.1/2">The Government are turning back the clock on women&#8217;s equality. Progress on the wage gap has stalled, and women&#8217;s financial independence is being undermined. Let us look at the Government&#8217;s proposal for a married couple&#8217;s tax allowance. It is less than &#163;4 and it will not benefit most married couples. For five out of six couples, it will represent a transfer from the purse to the wallet. It is money to the married man on his third wife, while the single mum, left behind to bring up the kids, will not get anything at all. This Government are taking a lot away from the purse to put a little bit back in the wallet.</p>
	<p pid="d.1162.1/3">This matters not simply for women&#8217;s lives and women&#8217;s equality, given that increasing women&#8217;s employment helped the last Labour Government to lift more than a million children out of poverty. All this progress is now at risk, and progress on child poverty has stalled. I look at my own constituency and see that use of food banks has gone through the roof.</p>

	<p pid="d.1163.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for drawing attention to that survey. I shall make sure that I look into its findings.</p>
	<p pid="d.1163.2/2">Many families must decide not when mum will go back to work after maternity leave, but whether it makes financial sense for her to do so at all. According to a survey by Asda, 70% of stay-at-home mums said that in the current climate they would be worse off if they worked, because of the cost of child care. The Government&#8217;s response has been to take &#163;7 billion away from families with children, and to remove the ring fence from Sure Start, breakfast clubs and after-school clubs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1163.2/3">The day before the election, the Prime Minister looked down the barrel of a camera and told women throughout the country that he backed Sure Start. Let me repeat his words in full.</p>
	<p pid="d.1163.2/4">&#8220;Yes, we back Sure Start. It&#8217;s a disgrace that Gordon Brown has been trying to frighten people about this. He&#8217;s the Prime Minister of this country but he&#8217;s been scaring people about something that really matters.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="d.1163.4/1">The hon. Lady has already intervened, and I want to allow others to speak.</p>
	<p pid="d.1163.4/2">Since the election there are 578 fewer Sure Start centres and 35,000 fewer child care places, and the number of breakfast and after-school clubs has been cut in more than a third of local authority areas. As for the women who have found work, it is the sort of work that leaves many families struggling to pay the bills. A record number of women are in part-time, temporary and low-wage jobs. One in four earns less than the living wage, as opposed to one in six men. The Government are wasting women&#8217;s talent, and costing the economy too. Where is their commitment to make work pay? On our first day in office, the next Labour Government will offer employers throughout Britain a &#8220;make work pay&#8221; contract to help them to pay the living wage.</p>

	<p pid="d.1164.4/1">I am nearing the end of my speech, so I will continue.</p>
	<p pid="d.1164.4/2">Something is broken when women are being forced to take two or three jobs in order to afford the basics for their families, and are being forced to take out payday loans just to make ends meet until the end of the month. We know that payday lenders target young women with their advertisements, and that the number of women declared insolvent is expected to overtake the number of men in that position for the first time. We need tough action to end the misery of so many women who are facing insurmountable debt. The next Labour Government will cap the total cost of credit. We will place a levy on the profits of payday lenders to double the public money available for low-cost alternatives for families, such as credit unions, and we will ban them from targeting kids with their advertisements.</p>
	<p pid="d.1164.4/3">All that we get from this Tory-led Government is complacency, and sometimes contempt, as I discovered this morning when I read in the newspapers that 42 Conservative Members of Parliament are members of the Free Enterprise Group, which advocates VAT on children&#8217;s clothes and on food. Was this some fringe group, I wondered? No. A Treasury Minister is a member, as is the child care Minister, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40560" name="Elizabeth Truss">the hon. Member for South West Norfolk (Elizabeth Truss)</phrase>. This is a group that recommends putting VAT on children&#8217;s clothes and shoes, baby food, car seats and prescriptions, raising the weekly shop by over &#163;8.</p>
	<p pid="d.1164.4/4">We need a Government who will take on the vested interests, who will stand up to the big six energy companies, reforming the market and freezing prices until 2017; a Government who are prepared to take on the payday lenders, and who will cut taxes for 24 million working</p>
	<p pid="d.1164.4/5">people with a lower 10p starting rate of tax; a Government who will cut business rates for small firms; a Government who will provide 25 hours of free child care for working parents of three and four-year-olds and a legal guarantee for every primary school in the country to provide breakfast clubs and after-school clubs, and introduce a compulsory jobs guarantee to bring down the number of women in long-term unemployment: a one nation Britain that values women&#8217;s talents, that supports mums back to work, that tackles the pay gap&#8212;a Britain where women play their full part. That is Labour&#8217;s Britain.</p>

	<p pid="d.1165.2/1">I am afraid that I cannot agree with the hon. Lady. I will come on to talk a little bit more about this, but the difficulty with the Opposition&#8217;s figures is that they assume that income is not shared throughout a household but that it is held on to by one parent in a two-parent household. The Labour figures also do not take into account self-employment, the correct inflation figures and any benefits or tax cuts. Therefore, the figure that was stated of &#163;1,600 does not actually stack up at all.</p>

	<p pid="d.1165.5/1">Does the Minister agree that in her view of the world the last Labour Government must have had tremendous power as they apparently brought about a financial crash not just in Britain but across the world? The situation</p>
	<p pid="d.1165.5/2">would not have been any different whichever party was in government&#8212;and we must remember that the current Government do not want to regulate anything any more and said we regulated too much.</p>

	<p pid="d.1166.0/1">That intervention shows the extent of the collective amnesia on the Opposition Benches. First, on the banking crisis the point is that the necessary reserves to deal with the unforeseen consequences were not set aside. Secondly, the last Government systematically over many years spent more than they were raising in taxes, so there were not the reserves to deal with this.</p>

	<p pid="d.1166.2/1">I do not agree on either point. The point about the borrowing is that it is called the automatic stabiliser, and it works. When the economy is in the situation it is in, it is helping out the very families the hon. Member for Ashfield was talking about.</p>

	<p pid="d.1166.3/1">The shadow Minister was intent on not taking an intervention from me earlier. Would my hon. Friend the Minister acknowledge that the Government have looked at how households work, and at how income comes into them, and recognised that there is a real cliff edge at 16 hours of work? That means that incomes drop away at that point, and that for every pound earned, 95p is taken away in reduced benefits. We are introducing a fundamental change that will alter the position of women and allow them to take on full-time work. That is something that Labour failed to deal with in the entire 13 years it was in government.</p>

Has she actually read the research into domestic violence and financial control? Does she really think that a simple transfer is made between men and women in every household in this country? Does she think that our concerns about the direct impact of Government policy on women&#8217;s purses are not well founded?</p>

	<p pid="d.1167.1/1">I would never want to downplay the effects of domestic violence. Sadly, I see cases in my constituency surgery on a regular basis, as we all do. The point is, however, that that is not happening in every household. Similarly, not every household is made up of two parents or just one parent; there are all sorts of different families. That is what this Government recognise: the situation is not uniform.</p>
	<p pid="d.1167.1/2">Thanks to the changes that we have made, and thanks, most importantly, to the hard work of women and men across the UK, our economy is turning a corner. The UK is now on the path to prosperity. The deficit is down by a third, gross domestic product is rising, and more people&#8212;including women&#8212;are in work than ever before. The more men and women who are taking home wages at the end of the month&#8212;especially when 25 million people&#8217;s wages are being boosted by our increase in the tax-free personal allowance&#8212;the higher will be the standard of living that we can expect to see in households across the country.</p>

	<p pid="d.1167.2/1">The Chartered Management Institute confirmed today that the bonuses paid to men are double the size of those paid to women doing the same job.

	<p pid="d.1167.3/1">Actually, we have had equal pay for 40 years. I shall talk in a moment about the pay gap having narrowed. Men and women should of course be paid the same amount for doing the same job. The Government have introduced a provision that, if a successful pay claim is brought, an automatic audit is triggered of the pay structure of the employer who has been caught falling foul of the law. That is something that the hon. Gentleman should welcome.</p>

	<p pid="d.1167.5/2">The Opposition have thrown a barrage of statistics on female employment at us across the Dispatch Box this afternoon. I should like your permission to throw just one back, Madam Deputy Speaker. As I have said, there are now more women in work than ever before. If I am allowed one more, I shall tell the House that there are nearly 450,000 more women in employment since the Government came to power, and nearly 300,000 fewer economically inactive women. We should be</p>
	<p pid="d.1167.5/3">celebrating the fact that there are now so many women in the labour market. Not only are there more women in the workplace, but the pay gap is shrinking, having fallen by nearly 1% last year. It now sits at just 9.6%.</p>

	<p pid="d.1168.1/1">I recall that the Prime Minister is going to write to the hon. Lady with that information, so I shall have to wait to see the letter. On the point about zero-hours contracts, first, the Government have announced that they are launching a review on the issue, and secondly, she ought to be looking at the number of Labour councils that employ people on those contracts first.</p>

	<p pid="d.1168.2/1">My hon. Friend will appreciate, as a Treasury Minister, that the fact that more women are in work than ever before will also help the Exchequer&#8217;s revenues. In the last full tax year, men paid more than &#163;90 billion in income tax whereas women paid only &#163;36 billion, so she can see how helping more women work up the income scale really helps the revenues.</p>

	<p pid="d.1168.3/1">My hon.

	<p pid="d.1168.4/1">I am sure that the Minister will agree that half the population are women and the vast majority of them are successful and contributing, not victims, as the Labour party would have us believe.

	<p pid="d.1168.5/1">My hon. Friend rightly says that 50% of the population are female&#8212;it would be nice if we saw a few more women in the House of Commons to represent that, but all parties are working on it. She is also right about deregulation. I am sure that she welcomes, as I do, the National Insurance Contributions Bill, which the Exchequer Secretary is taking through the Public Bill Committee at the moment. It will give all small businesses a &#163;2,000 employment allowance so that they can recruit more people.</p>

	<p pid="d.1169.1/2">Let me talk about women and the workplace. As I said, we want to see not only more women in the workplace, but more women rising to the top of their workplaces. I am delighted that the Minister for Women and Equalities is on the Benches today, as she has been doing so much work to promote women in the workplace. I was also delighted to see Fiona Woolf, the second ever female Lord Mayor of London, coming into post earlier this month. I am sure that she will be an excellent role model for women in the City of London. But we need to do what we can to help more women to reach these senior positions and play an even more prominent role in our recovery. As many hon. Members will know, last month we published a Government action plan specifically designed to help women start out, get on and stay on in our workplaces by taking steps on things such as training, skills and flexible working.</p>

	<p pid="d.1169.3/1">My hon. Friend is, of course, right about that. The best way to address living standards is by dealing with the economic crisis, so that families can find work in a growing economy. He is absolutely right to say that it is not fair to burden future generations with debt, which is why this Government have taken the tough actions they have.</p>
	<p pid="d.1169.3/2">I shall now discuss child care. For any mothers and fathers to succeed in the workplace, we need to have the right policy in place to support them. The Labour party is right to draw attention to the importance of parental leave and child care, but let me remind the Opposition that we were the Government who recognised the current system of leave and pay for parents as being not only old-fashioned and inflexible, but as playing a role in reinforcing the idea that women are the primary carers of children. Our new system will give real choice to families, and, from 2015, will allow working parents to share leave once the mother feels ready to end her maternity leave.</p>
	<p pid="d.1169.3/3">I remind the Opposition that we were the party that made sweeping changes on flexible leave and that they were the party that presided over child-care costs rising</p>
	<p pid="d.1169.3/4">to the second highest level in the developed world. We are working hard to address that and to make child care more affordable for parents across the United Kingdom.

	<p pid="d.1170.3/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The increase in the personal tax threshold meant that 57% of those who benefited and who were taken out of tax were women. That is 145,000 women who are no longer paying income tax. That money is staying in their households and they are able to spend it on themselves and their families, which should be welcomed.</p>

	<p pid="d.1170.5/1">I will make some progress. There will be an additional 100,000 families who will eligible for child care support under universal credit. We have also ensured that our changes help the record number of women who have entered self-employment under this Government. That is a critical step. If women started businesses at the same rate as men, we could have an extra 1 million female entrepreneurs and a million more entrepreneurs, which would mean a million more people creating wealth, jobs and growth for our economy.</p>

	<p pid="d.1170.7/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right, and it is a critical point. The tax-free child care policy that we have announced will, for the first time, benefit self-employed women, and that is something that the current voucher system does not do.</p>
	<p pid="d.1170.7/2">In conclusion, it is clear that, despite some of the claims put forward by the Opposition, the Government&#8217;s plan for recovery is the only plan that will create sustainable long-term growth for our country. It is the only plan that will support employment. It is also the only plan that not only puts faith in the abilities of the women and men of this country to help us work our way back into prosperity, but puts money, through our rise in the personal allowance, back into their pockets. I, like the hon. Member for Ashfield, want to see even more women working, setting up businesses and rising to the top of businesses. The Government want to make that happen, so I ask the House to reject the motion before us.</p>

	<p pid="d.1171.1/1">It is a pleasure to speak in this debate under your chairship, Madam Deputy Speaker. I want to say a brief word about three groups of women. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40048" name="Gloria De Piero">the Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero)</phrase> has already done a sterling job of opening the debate and it is important that we pay attention to those groups of women who are often not spoken up for sufficiently in this Chamber: single mums, care workers and older women.</p>
	<p pid="d.1171.1/2">It is something about being a woman in politics, I suppose, but because we are a slightly rare breed women in my constituency often approach me relatively quietly and say wonderful things such as, &#8220;I have told my daughter about you.&#8221; I hope that that is for good reasons. With that comes a duty to speak up for those women whose voice is not always loudest, and it is not always loudest because, to be honest, those women are quite busy. On this point, I must disagree with the Minister. She quoted the first female Prime Minister, who apparently said, &#8220;If you want something said, ask a man; if you want something done, ask a woman.&#8221; The women I know in Wirral are quite good at talking. I think that if you want something said, ask a woman; if you want something done, ask a woman.</p>
	<p pid="d.1171.1/3">Single mums, in particular, are incredibly busy and deserve all the support we can muster. Frankly, they do a brilliant job bringing up children and young people. That is why it is incredibly distressing to me that research on the impact of Government policies up to 2015-16 produced in September by the Women&#8217;s Budget Group found that women living on their own would lose the most from the combined impact of changes to taxes and cuts to social security benefits and public services. To me, it is horrendous that the Government&#8217;s economic policies will hit women living on their own the hardest. I know many such women in my constituency, and they work incredibly hard, do a good job bringing up children or looking after older loved ones, and they deserve our support and backing. They should not bear the brunt of this Government&#8217;s economic policy.</p>
	<p pid="d.1171.1/4">I must say a word about the marriage tax allowance.</p>

	<p pid="d.1172.0/1">What would the hon. Lady have said to the young woman who came to my surgery to say that she had a choice between putting petrol in the car and putting food on the table for her children? That was a single mother in my constituency in 2008.</p>

I remember only too well my mum&#8217;s experience of being a childminder and setting up a pre-school in Wirral, in my constituency.

	<p pid="d.1172.2/1">I know that the hon. Lady does not like to hear facts, but the fact is that today this Government have delivered more jobs for women than ever before in history and certainly more than under 13 years of Labour. More women are in work today than ever before.</p>

Member for Braintree (Mr Newmark)</phrase> tells me that I do not like to hear facts, and then he confuses the population of women in employment with the unemployment rate. I am sorry&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> Madam Deputy Speaker, it is incredibly frustrating in this House when people shout things like, &#8220;More women in work than ever before,&#8221; when we all know that the rate of unemployment is what matters. I suggest that the hon. Gentleman acquaints himself with some of the facts. If the population increases, that will increase the population in work. It is the unemployment rate that matters, most importantly the long-term unemployment rate. That is the most damaging thing, as I know from communities such as mine. Long-term unemployment has increased eight times as fast for women as it has for men, so I would instruct the hon. Gentleman to acquaint himself with the facts rather than coming to this House to patronise me.</p>

	<p pid="d.1172.7/1">Unfortunately, I am not surprised by that fact. I am only too aware of it. I suggest that the hon. Member for Braintree acquaints himself with the facts before he intervenes again.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172.7/2">I intervened to mention care workers and zero-hours contracts. I see this a great deal in my constituency, so I make no apology for raising the issue in the House</p>
	<p pid="d.1172.7/3">again. The Government estimate that 1,750 people are working in the care sector in Wirral. It is my assumption from experience, although we do not know, that many of those are women. It is my guess that many of them are older women. I hope the Ministers on the Treasury Bench might at some point go and talk to women working in the care sector. I am sure they will do so in their constituencies. They will hear about the heartbreaking experience of women who face local government cuts, which creates low wages in the sector and means that there is not always good training.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172.7/4">Local government cuts have had a severe impact on care, which has affected not only those who receive that care and support, but those working in the sector and their ability to make ends meet while they do an incredibly stressful job, sometimes caring for older people at the end of their life, which I know Ministers will agree is a terribly important job. I am sure they will look at that issue with great care and attention.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172.7/5">Finally, I want to say a couple of words about older women. I believe that my generation stands on the shoulders of the generation that was born in the 1950s. That group of women saw none of the benefits of the legal and social change that they fought for, but they fought for it none the less. They are now being punished by this Government because of pension changes that have gone through too quickly. They are also a generation of women who, as I mentioned in response to the intervention from the hon. Member for Braintree, have seen much greater unemployment by proportion compared with men. As my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40140" name="Harriet Harman">the Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase> has pointed out so eloquently, they are a generation of women who always seem in danger of being counted out.</p>
	<p pid="d.1172.7/6">Let us not do that economically. That generation of women fought for the rights that have enabled people like me to see any success in my life. Let us make sure that we back them up, not just in terms of pensions, but in terms of their living costs now, and make sure that they do not face the severe and significant unemployment that hurts their chances now and as they move into later life.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-19d.1173.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40550" speakername="Andrea Leadsom" colnum="1173"  time="017:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0003.htm#131119-0003.htm_spnew100">
	<p pid="d.1173.0/1">It is regrettable that Labour likes to portray women as always victims. It is important that this Government see women for what they are&#8212;people with all sorts of different ambitions, different needs, different aspirations and so on. It is impossible to define what women want, other than to say that they want to be able to choose and not to be punished for their own choices. Choosing to stay at home and raise children; to work part time and use informal child care; to use nurseries or childminders; to have a stunning career running a FTSE 100 company, or as a pop star or a brain surgeon; to retire early or volunteer for a charity; to care for elderly relatives or disabled children; to be a teacher or, yes, even a politician&#8212;what women want is utterly varied, and I am proud of the way that this Government have made efforts to create choice and opportunity for women.</p>
	<p pid="d.1173.0/2">We all know that times have never been tougher economically. Austerity has limited our ability just to keep spending, but it has not stopped the Government&#8217;s desire to reform, and to support women in their own</p>
	<p pid="d.1173.0/3">choices. There is no escape from the appalling mess that Britain was in in 2010, but the Government have been committed to raising the tax-free allowance for the lowest paid to &#163;10,000 per annum by 2014. In spite of being almost half the work force, women are by far the lowest earners, so keeping more of their income is vital for them. Freezing fuel duty and council tax has helped all families through these tough times. But above all, dealing with the deficit has been and should be the key goal.</p>

	<p pid="d.1174.0/1">My hon. Friend talks about the deficit. Does she think it is responsible for a Government not to tackle that and to pass it on to our children and grandchildren so that they have to deal with the problem?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="d.1174.1/1">My hon. Friend is quite right, and I was coming on to say that our deficit is not some airy-fairy statistic; it is the debt that is growing from it that is the biggest threat to our children and grandchildren. If we do not sort it out in our lifetime, it will wreck their future. That matters not just to loving mums, but to loving dads and loving grandparents. The Opposition must stop making light of it. It is real; it is there; it has to be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174.1/2">Unemployment rose by 29% for women under Labour. Now there are more women in employment than ever before. The unemployment rate for women has fallen to 7%. At all levels we are helping women to build and develop successful businesses. The Women&#8217;s Business Council, set up in 2012, is taking many different actions, including providing business grants and mentors to female entrepreneurs. We are promoting business to girls in school and providing student enterprise loans. In the boardroom, under this Government female representation has risen from 12.2% to 17.3% in three years. We have a long way to go, but it is real progress in what women want.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174.1/3">Women and men are working parents. We have just had a debate on child care, and our policies to support the cost of child care through tax breaks, as well as a raft of measures to encourage new childminders to professionalise the nursery work force and to give parents the confidence that they are getting quality child care as well as helping with the cost of it, are vital.</p>

	<p pid="d.1174.2/1">Is the hon. Lady aware that the Education Committee&#8217;s recent report found that since 2010 more than 30% of child care centres in this country no longer have children in them?</p>

	<p pid="d.1174.3/1">I was not in the Education Committee, but I am absolutely passionate about child care for the very young and the support that we provide to them. As chair of the all-party group on Sure Start children centres, I can tell the hon. Lady that in our year-long inquiry into best practice in Sure Start centres, there was no evidence of wholesale closures. In fact, there is a real focus on improving the outcomes for families and children. I assure her of that. I urge her to read our report.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174.3/2">I also urge all parties to get behind the 1001 critical days manifesto, which looks at what more we can do to support the earliest relationships in families. It is through creating those secure early bonds that we go on to help families to build and develop the emotional resilience</p>
	<p pid="d.1174.3/3">that they need to be secure and happy adults. That does not affect only women, but with one in 10 women suffering post-natal depression, and with so much family breakdown as a result of poor early relationships, I urge all colleagues to get behind our manifesto, which was launched by me, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40079" name="Frank Field">the right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field)</phrase>, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40121" name="Caroline Lucas">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase> and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40594" name="Paul Burstow">the right hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow)</phrase>. It is a truly cross-party manifesto, and I urge all hon. Members to look at it. We should all call for support in the earliest years. That would really support women.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174.3/4">However, women are not just parents and they are not just in business; they are also carers pretty much all the time. Most of the caring in this country falls to women. Women look after the elderly, the young and the disabled. They are also very often the volunteers. They do the brilliant work in food banks and in all the charities. I chair the charities PIP UK, the Parent Infant Partnerships UK; NorPIP, the Northamptonshire Parent Infant Partnership; and OxPIP, the Oxford Parent Infant Project. They provide help for post-natally depressed women, and in those charities it is largely women who volunteer. So many women come to my surgeries to talk about their caring responsibilities. Our policy to combine health and social care for the elderly is incredibly welcome to many as it means that their elderly relatives will have a greater chance of longer independent living, and our policy to introduce personal independence payments for disabled adults and children is welcome to many families who recognise the independence it gives them in making those choices.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174.3/5">Above all, our education reforms will give children a real chance in life. Between 2000 and 2009, under Labour, England fell from seventh place to 25th in international school performance in reading, from eighth to 28th in maths and from fourth to 16th in science. Those things&#8212;the future of our children&#8212;matter desperately to women and men, but very much to women. It is a priority for our Government, as are our 250,000 new apprenticeships and our superb new university technical colleges, ensuring that children are supported in their future choices.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174.3/6">Then, of course, there are women as pensioners. Our pensions system is complicated and serves women badly. On average, women get &#163;40 less in state pension than men and are much more likely to live in poverty, so they welcome our new single-tier pension. It will disproportionately benefit women, ensuring that those who took time out to raise a family do not suffer in their retirement as a result.</p>
	<p pid="d.1174.3/7">In conclusion, women have so much to offer and so many needs. I want to highlight a few other things the Government are doing for women, such as our determination to tackle female genital mutilation, to build and support rape crisis centres, to support refuges for victims of domestic violence and to tackle human trafficking. All these, and many more, deeply held aspirations and needs of women are being addressed and sorted by this Government. I am incredibly proud of our focus on being the future for women in our society. I hope that the Opposition will come to recognise that it is this Government who are helping women to achieve their dreams and that, in order to achieve the equality we are all striving for, they have to stop seeing women as victims.</p>

	<p pid="d.1176.0/1">A few weeks ago I was listening to &#8220;The Morning Show&#8221; on Radio Nottingham. They were discussing whether people felt better off now that the economy is growing again. A mum rang in. She was working but finding it a real struggle to make ends meet. She admitted that sometimes, in order to get by, she had to ask her son if she could borrow some money from his piggy bank. That is just one story&#8212;an anecdote&#8212;but I think that it says a lot about life under this Government. Government Members talk about intergenerational fairness. What is fair about a mum having to borrow money from her child to manage until her next payday?</p>
	<p pid="d.1176.0/2">Of course, it is not just one mother who is struggling to get by; millions of women are, and not just in Nottingham, but up and down the country. It is not just women who are struggling, because families up and down the country are facing a cost of living crisis, but it is women who are being hit hardest of all, through cuts in public services, cut in public sector jobs, cuts in the real value of their wages and cuts in the social security benefits they rely on. It is women who are unable to access or afford care for their children or disabled or frail relatives, who are being denied adequate support when they experience domestic abuse, who are losing good jobs in the public services and who are unable to cope with longer waits for the social security benefits they have earned.</p>

	<p pid="d.1176.1/1">The hon. Lady talks about responsibility. Does she think that it was responsible for the previous Government to borrow &#163;1 of every &#163;4 they spent? Is that not one reason for the problems we now face?</p>

	<p pid="d.1176.2/1">I am not going to take any lectures from Government Members who have doubled the amount of debt in this country.</p>
	<p pid="d.1176.2/2">Of the &#163;14 billion the Government are taking from people&#8217;s pockets to pay down the deficit through changes in tax, benefits, pay and pensions since the general election, &#163;11 billion is from women, even though they still earn less and own less than men. More than 40 years after Labour&#8217;s Equal Pay Act 1970 outlawed paying women less than men for the same work, women still face a lifetime of earning less. For every &#163;1 a man takes home, a women takes home just 85p.</p>
	<p pid="d.1176.2/3">Under this Government, the situation is likely to get worse. The cuts mean that women are losing employment in the public sector, but they are not getting comparable jobs in the private sector. The Women&#8217;s Budget Group analysis shows the following: although unemployment across the whole UK has fallen by 0.6% for men, it has increased by 0.8% for women; the number of women who are unemployed has increased by nearly 15% to over 1 million, the highest level for a generation; and long-term unemployment has increased eight times faster for women than for men. For older women aged over 50, the situation is even worse: unemployment is up by 42,000&#8212;more than a third&#8212;since the general election, while for older men it has fallen. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40048" name="Gloria De Piero">the Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero)</phrase> said, unemployment rates are particularly high among black and ethnic minority women.</p>
	<p pid="d.1176.2/4">Some jobs have been created in the private sector, but overall 63% of them went to men and only 37% to women. For women who are still working in the public sector, while wages have been frozen, at least progress was being made year on year to close the gender pay gap, with the difference between the hourly pay rates for men and women narrowing from 18.2% to 14.2% in recent years. There has been no comparable reduction in the private sector, where women earn, on average, 25.1% less per hour than men. As the Fawcett Society warns:</p>
	<p pid="d.1176.2/5">&#8220;Unless the government takes urgent action, women will lose their precarious footing in the workforce. We face a labour market characterised by persistent and rising levels of women&#8217;s unemployment, shrinking pay levels for women and a widening of the gender pay gap.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1176.2/6">Even the recent return to growth will not necessarily help if the Government do not act. Professor Diane Elson of the Women&#8217;s Budget Group says:</p>
	<p pid="d.1176.2/7">&#8220;Our big concern is that&#8230;women are going to be so far behind they will not be able to catch up.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1176.2/8">Is there any reason to hope the Government are listening and will act? Not if recent announcements are anything to go by. The Tories&#8217; Free Enterprise Group wants to extend VAT&#8212;a deeply regressive tax that hits the poorest hardest&#8212;to essentials such as food, children&#8217;s clothes and bus fares. The Lib Dems tell us that the answer is to increase the income tax threshold. The Deputy Prime Minister claims that that will help those on low incomes, but any gain will be far outweighed by the Government&#8217;s tax rises and unfair changes to tax credits&#8212;and of course the very poorest will not benefit at all.</p>

	<p pid="d.1177.0/1">As a member of the Free Enterprise Group, I want to put it on record that I oppose the suggestion that was made by one individual in that group. We should not impose VAT on children&#8217;s clothing and food, in particular, as that would be regressive and punitive. It was not said by the Free Enterprise Group but by one individual in that group, and I certainly oppose it.</p>

	<p pid="d.1177.1/1">I am sure we have all read about the proposed changes and know who to believe.</p>
	<p pid="d.1177.1/2">The Government&#8217;s own impact assessment on the tax threshold rise to &#163;10,000 shows that 57% of those gaining from the measure are men and only 43% are women. The Women&#8217;s Budget Group notes that three quarters of the gain will go to the better-off half of all households. On average, households in the poorest 10% of the distribution gain just &#163;6 per year; in contrast, the richest 10% of households gain an average of &#163;87 per year. What has the Government&#8217;s priority been? A tax cut for those earning over &#163;150,000 a year and a massive giveaway to millionaires, while child benefit&#8212;a lifeline for many mums&#8212;has been frozen not once but for three years in a row. Tax credits and other benefits that many low-paid women rely on will rise by just 1%, condemning families to falling living standards and increasing the pressure on women, who are most often responsible for making ends meet. It is not a record to be proud of.</p>
	<p pid="d.1177.1/3">These changes threaten women&#8217;s economic autonomy. Women who live on their own lose most from the combined impact of changes to taxes and cuts to benefits and services.</p>

	<p pid="d.1178.1/1">No, I am not going to take another intervention.</p>
	<p pid="d.1178.1/2">Single mothers lose out the most, losing 15.6% of their disposable income compared with single fathers, who lose 11.7% and couples with children who lose 9.7.%. Among pensioners, single women lose 12.5% compared with single male pensioners losing 9.5% and pensioner couples losing 8.6%. Even among working-age families with no children, single women find that their spending power is cut the most. No wonder Mumsnet found that women of all ages and all backgrounds are fed up with this Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.1178.1/3">It does not have to be this way. Governments can act, even in tough times, to support women rather than making life harder. They could support more women to get into work or stay at work when they start a family by extending free nursery places for three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 25 hours a week. I remember what a difference it made to me and my friends when our children started at nursery, and that was in better economic times. Now, under this Tory-Lib Dem Government, the cost of nursery places has risen five times faster than pay, with Sure Start centres closing at a rate of three per week and child care places falling by more than 35,000. The Government could support the parents of school-aged children by providing a legal guarantee for breakfast and after-school club care. Instead, they have scrapped Labour&#8217;s extended schools programme.</p>
	<p pid="d.1178.1/4">In Nottingham, a rise in pupil numbers has left an increasing number of parents and children without access to the care they need. An e-mail from a mum in my constituency, who wrote to me on behalf of a group of parents at her children&#8217;s school, says it all:</p>
	<p pid="d.1178.1/5">&#8220;The problem is that we need after school childcare provision for our children and are running out of options&#8212;the likelihood is that some of us will have to give up jobs or take career breaks to fit in around available childcare provision&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1178.1/6">This Government could provide real incentives to reward firms that sign up to be living wage employers. Earlier this month, I was proud to join Nottingham Citizens and Nottinghamshire living wage employers to launch the new national living wage for the country. At that launch, Jhudari Scholar, who is 18 and head boy at his school, explained how hard it was for his mum, a cleaner working three jobs on below living wage rates. It is just shocking. KPMG reported recently that the number of people earning less than a living wage has risen by more than 400,000 in the past year to 5.2 million, and it is women who are disproportionately stuck on those wages.</p>
	<p pid="d.1178.1/7">Women in my constituency deserve better. They deserve better than a Government who stand by as their living standards are eroded. They deserve a Government who are on their side. I just wish they did not have to wait another 534 days to get one.</p>

	<p pid="d.1178.2/1">The Liberal Democrats are doing what they can to build a stronger economy and a fairer society. We recognise that households are under pressure, which is why we have taken action to try to support women with the cost of living.</p>
	<p pid="d.1178.2/2">The Lib Dems want to help women on low and medium incomes by letting them keep more of the salaries they earn. By April 2014, 1.5 million women&#8212;60% of the overall figure of 2.7 million people&#8212;will have been taken out of paying tax altogether by the rise in the tax threshold to &#163;10,000. We are also giving a tax cut of more than &#163;700 a year to more than 20 million lower and middle earners, the majority of whom are women. The Deputy Prime Minister is planning to put a further &#163;100 back into people&#8217;s pockets through the workers&#8217; bonus, which could increase the tax allowance to &#163;10,500 by the next election.</p>

	<p pid="d.1179.0/1">The problem with the hon. Lady&#8217;s presentation of the issue is that it is very one-sided, because in order to pay for that tax cut there have been cuts to tax credits and other benefits, so on balance the lowest earners have lost, not gained.</p>

	<p pid="d.1179.3/1">I am going to continue.</p>
	<p pid="d.1179.3/2">We are creating more jobs for women, which is the best way of helping them with the cost of living. There are 427,000 more women in employment and almost 100,000 more women in self-employment since 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.1179.3/3">We have helped create more than 1 million apprenticeships, of which more than half have been taken by women. We are taking steps to narrow inequality in the labour market. The proportion of female FTSE 100 directorships has increased by 50% since February 2011, and the gender pay gap has fallen from 20.2% in 2011 to 19.7% in 2012. That is small but undeniable progress.</p>
	<p pid="d.1179.3/4">The Liberal Democrat pensions Minister has helped women by introducing a new single-tier pension. Under the existing system, many women have lost out because the years they spent raising children were not properly counted towards their national insurance contributions. Under our scheme, those years will now count in full. That is so much fairer for women, who currently receive, on average, &#163;40 less than men from their state pension.</p>
	<p pid="d.1179.3/5">We have helped drivers and consumers by freezing Labour&#8217;s fuel duty escalator for 41 months. At present, this is saving the average motorist about &#163;7 every time she fills her tank, and it is likely to save her &#163;10 a time by 2015. In my area, where there is little or no public transport, and in most rural areas in general, that, of course, directly affects women who spend a lot of their time needing to use a car, particularly to transport elderly parents or younger children around.</p>
	<p pid="d.1179.3/6">The Lib Dem policy of free child care has started to assist families of about 130,000 two-year-olds to become eligible for an early education place. As well as helping to improve living standards, our scheme will transform children&#8217;s life chances. The Deputy Prime Minister has announced that the scheme will double in size from September 2014. We recognise that looking at child care can be key to building a stronger economy.</p>

	<p pid="d.1180.0/1">Perhaps the Minister will give the hon. Lady a glass a water to help her throat. May I just ask about pensions for young people today, and what will happen to them in the future?

	<p pid="d.1180.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for intervening. At least we are making sure that young people have a better chance to access a better education early on. Everybody knows that the money put into education early on can transform children&#8217;s life chances so much more dramatically. Those children will be the ones paying my pension and his, so it is important to concentrate on education.</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/2">For parents who wish to return to work and, through the Lib Dems, are given recognition and respect for choosing to do so&#8212;just as we respect parents who wish to stay at home and look after their children&#8212;the importance of good-quality child care is paramount. We know that child care is very expensive and is a problem for families. It was a problem for many years under Labour, and when I was bringing up my children under the preceding Conservative Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/3">We are helping mothers with the cost of child care. We are providing 15 hours of free early education for all three and four-year-olds, which we will extend to 260,000 two-year-olds from next year. We are planning to introduce tax-free child care that, when fully implemented, will save a typical working family with two children under 12 up to &#163;2,400 per year. In total, the coalition Government are investing about &#163;1 billion a year in additional support for child care by 2016-17, including &#163;750 million for the new tax-free child care scheme and &#163;200 million in expanded support through universal credit.</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/4">The Lib Dems are wholeheartedly committed to shared parental leave, which creates more flexibility for parents, locks female talent into the labour market and will ultimately achieve a fairer balance for both men and women at home and in the work place. That Lib Dem priority for Government is one that we have delivered. Flexible working and shared parental leave is important in helping to create a fairer society, and the coalition Government have already implemented their commitment to extending flexible working to all parents with children under the age of 18. We now intend to extend the right to request flexible working to all employees.</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/5">The Lib Dems welcome the fact that in many modern families, child care is no longer the sole responsibility of the mother. Fathers and male partners play an increasingly vital role in raising children, and it is important that the Government should accommodate that by providing for shared parental leave. The system of maternity, paternity and adoption leave and pay that we inherited from the previous Government was inflexible and outdated. The coalition&#8217;s reforms will ensure that, for the first time, mothers can go on maternity leave or shared parental leave at the same time&#8212;during the first weeks after a birth&#8212;as fathers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/6">We are working hard to help improve living standards, but we cannot get away from the fact that they started to decline under the previous Government. It was a painful symptom of their disastrous economic record, and the fact that they left us with an annual deficit of &#163;160 billion.</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/7">To conclude, the Lib Dems are on record as saying that economic sustainability is important and that we want</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/8">&#8220;an economic system where the current generation can enjoy the fruits of its endeavours without relying for its living standards on a legacy of debt left to the next generation.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/9">That means that we have to deal with the huge financial crisis with which we are faced. That is why we are committed to the changes that we are making. The Deputy Prime Minister was campaigning on the effect of the current situation on women more than a year ago, before the Labour party focused on it. He said that</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/10">&#8220;despite rising since the 1960s, female employment has stalled over the last decade. It is, however, a problem we can no longer afford. Just as working women drove up living standards in the latter half of the 20th century, all the evidence suggests that living standards in the first half of the 21st century will need to be driven by working women once again and this absence of women from our economy is costing us dearly.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1180.1/11">Several motions on this issue have been passed at Liberal Democrat party conferences and we are committed to improving child care and extending free child care. We will face the next election with that commitment in our manifesto.</p>

However, if the main aim is to assist the lowest earners, it is an extremely poorly targeted policy. It is an expensive tax cut. Three quarters of the billions of pounds that have been spent on raising the tax threshold have gone to the top half of earners in our country.</p>

	<p pid="d.1181.2/1">I will continue with what I was saying, because it is important to realise the cost of this policy to many women.</p>
	<p pid="d.1181.2/2">This generous gesture, which has advantaged more people on upper earnings, has been balanced by taxes and cuts elsewhere, such as the raising of VAT. Many of the cuts have affected women in particular. The cuts in tax credits have more than cancelled out the rise in the tax threshold for the lower-paid. People who have been affected by that will not be saying, &#8220;It was great that the tax threshold was raised.&#8221; They would probably rather have stayed in exactly the same position as they were in before.</p>

The argument is made that raising the tax threshold allows people to keep more of their earnings, instead of tax being taken away with one hand and paid back with the other. The problem is that the policy has not been even-handed. Some people have ended up worse off as a result of it. Those who used to benefit and have lost out are predominantly women.</p>

	<p pid="d.1182.1/1">The hon. Lady has told the House that the path onwards involves more raising of tax thresholds, regardless of who will or will not benefit from that. A further rise in tax thresholds, however, will do absolutely nothing for many who already earn below that level, particularly women who are part-time workers. How will that further generosity&#8212;which, as I have said, benefits more those whose earnings are in the upper brackets&#8212;be paid for? On the basis of the past three and a half years, presumably it will be paid for by yet more cuts to benefits and services that help a lot of women.</p>

	<p pid="d.1182.3/1">I will not give way again.</p>
	<p pid="d.1182.3/2">In future&#8212;assuming, of course, that universal credit ever materialises, which is far from certain at the moment&#8212;low-paid people will benefit even less as the tax threshold increases. Universal credit will be calculated on net, rather than gross earnings. Therefore, if a taxpayer who claims universal credit receives a tax cut of &#163;100, they will automatically lose &#163;65 of benefits. The lowest paid taxpayers are going to suffer more, and a solution would be to commit to increase the amount someone can earn before universal credit payments are reduced every time tax thresholds go up. Those who advocate the solution for low-paid workers have told us time and again that the reason for raising tax thresholds is not to benefit everyone but to benefit low-paid workers. However, it will not benefit those workers to anything like that extent&#8212;indeed, for many of them probably not at all.</p>
	<p pid="d.1182.3/3">We are constantly being told that we have to make tough choices&#8212;<phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40540" name="Stephen Metcalfe">the hon. Member for South Basildon and East Thurrock (Stephen Metcalfe)</phrase>, who wanted to intervene, has constantly risen to speak about the need to deal with the deficit. Choices are being made in the way the Government are proceeding, including the choice to give those generous tax cuts and want to continue to do so, but that does not sound like a terribly tough choice for some people to make.</p>
	<p pid="d.1182.3/4">There are other uses for the money if it is available. We could give a tax break to businesses that agree to pay the living wage, which would benefit women in particular. We could increase help with child care costs now. Child care tax credits were cut from 80% to 70% by the coalition. I know the Government say that they will restore that for recipients of universal credit when&#8212;if&#8212;it comes in, and the new child care tax relief starts in 2015. Why not now, however, especially with universal credit receding somewhere over the horizon? Further to that, the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission suggests that the Government should reallocate the</p>
	<p pid="d.1182.3/5">2013 Budget funding for child care tax relief from higher rate tax payers to those on universal credit. That would be over and above existing plans&#8212;this is a recent report from the commission&#8212;to help those who want to work and need help with child care.</p>
	<p pid="d.1182.3/6">Gingerbread, which will obviously advocate on behalf of families with one parent, 90% of whom are women, has made proposals for improving universal credit that would make work pay and encourage the progression through employment that is desired by us all. The old 16-hour rule that Government parties tend to dismiss was to ensure that going back to work really improved people&#8217;s situation, rather than the mini-jobs that, frankly, leave people poor.</p>
	<p pid="d.1182.3/7">Gingerbread has suggested that we increase the amount a claimant can earn before universal credit starts to be withdrawn, and reduce the rate at which benefits are reduced&#8212;the taper rate. Those proposals cost money, but if money is available&#8212;clearly it is for those who advocate another increase in the basic tax threshold&#8212;I urge the Government to consider measures such as those advocated by Gingerbread genuinely to help the lowest earners improve their position.</p>
	<p pid="d.1182.3/8">One point I completely refute is the suggestion that if we say that life under this Government is hard for many women, we are calling women victims. Far from being victims, women are struggling to bring up their children despite the difficulties that they face. It is completely wrong to suggest that we are therefore painting them as victims&#8212;far from it.</p>

	<p pid="d.1183.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" name="Sheila Gilmore">the hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore)</phrase>, a former colleague on the Work and Pensions Committee, who is one of the most diligent attendees in the Chamber. However, I shall disagree vehemently with her and demolish a number of the arguments that are inherent in today&#8217;s motion. I urge all hon. Members to vote against it at 7 o&#8217;clock.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183.0/2">I shall start with some of the macroeconomic arguments and make the case that the way to destroy a country&#8217;s wealth, and to plunge people into many years of poverty, is to do what the previous Government did to the economy&#8212;create the largest recession for 60 years and the most significant banking crisis ever. I shall also outline the course of policy to follow for economic prosperity.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183.0/3">The secret of economic prosperity is not hard to find, but it is hard to achieve. The first ingredient is obviously a strong central bank maintaining sound monetary policy and a prudent Chancellor who maintains sound public finances. That is the framework that provides the environment in which businesses can invest, grow, export and create jobs. It is not politicians who create that wealth and those jobs, but we can damage the cost of living and the growth of businesses with bad monetary policies, high taxes, irresponsible borrowing, excessive regulation and the high interest rates that we saw under the previous Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183.0/4">The decision to make the Bank of England independent in 1997 was just about the only decision made by the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath</p>
	<p pid="d.1183.0/5">(Mr Brown) with which I agreed. The mandate to keep inflation at 2% has meant some predictability and stability from the inflationary ravages that we all remember from the Labour Governments of the 1970s. It is essential that the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, is able to unwind the current additional monetary stimulus that has been needed since the crash of 2008 without allowing any major deviation from that 2% target. Sound money will mean that the pound stays strong. Given the UK&#8217;s dependence on imported goods and fuel, a strong pound keeps our cost of living down.</p>
	<p pid="d.1183.0/6">The Government also need to play a part. The Chancellor has taken the tough and necessary steps to bring the public finances back into structural balance.</p>

	<p pid="d.1184.4/1">Some Opposition Members think that the Chancellor has tightened too fast, but others might argue that he could have tightened faster. I say that he has been a Goldilocks Chancellor, and this has been a tightening at the pace at which job creation has been allowed to flourish. I also want to put on record that there has been no recession in this country since 2009. At all points in this fiscal responsibility, the Chancellor has looked for measures that have helped hard-working families keep their cost of living under control. He has helped councils freeze their council tax, he has raised the tax-free threshold for working people and he has avoided the 13p fuel duty increase that Labour had planned&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="d.1184.6/1">The previous Government, as we heard from the hon. Member for Edinburgh East, thought it was appropriate to tax people earning only &#163;6,500 per year, and to give them their own money back in the form of tax credits. I believe it is more important that we do not take that money in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="d.1184.6/2">I want to demolish what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40048" name="Gloria De Piero">the hon. Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero)</phrase> said on disposable incomes. Since the start of the economic downturn, the average equivalised household income has fallen by about &#163;1,200 since 2007-08. The Opposition talked about the average fall, but the richest fifth of households have seen largest fall. In contrast, after accounting for inflation and household</p>
	<p pid="d.1184.6/3">composition, the average income for the poorest fifth of households has grown in the same period by 6.9%&#8212;a statistic from the Office for National Statistics. I refute the argument inherent in the motion that we have had a particularly serious impact on the cost of living for women.</p>
	<p pid="d.1184.6/4">I would also like to demolish the claim in the motion that the Chancellor has made</p>
	<p pid="d.1184.6/5">&#8220;women pay three times more than men to bring down the deficit&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1184.6/6">I have taken the trouble to look at the Full Fact website, which I recommend to Opposition Members. It makes a line-by-line demolition of their claims. For example, women such as me, who earn more than &#163;60,000, no longer receive child benefit. That is counted as a negative, but I would argue that that is a sensible way to reallocate scarce resources. The Opposition count it as a negative that the income tax cut does not help women as much as men, whereas I think it is a good thing that women are given a tax break.</p>
	<p pid="d.1184.6/7">The third point I would like to demolish is that it is a problem for more women than ever before to be in work. I welcome it. One reason this has been a successful area of welfare reform is that the number of lone parents out of work&#8212;I accept that the number of lone parents out of work declined under the previous Government&#8212;has declined sharply since 2010, falling by 26% to just under 500,000. I agree that that is still too high and we have more to do, but we are doing an enormous amount&#8212;providing free child care and helping lone parents into work&#8212;to help them to lift their own families out of poverty. There are other positive aspects of welfare reform for women in the workplace. Although well intentioned, a terrible consequence of Labour&#8217;s approach to welfare is that it trapped many women in 16-hour-a-week jobs. I have met many women in my constituency who have said, &#8220;I have been offered more hours, but it does not make economic sense for me to take them.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="d.1185.1/2">In fact, we were paying a lot of women to maintain 16-hour-a-week jobs. That may be ideal for some people&#8217;s family situation, but it sends a poor message, through the welfare system, that we need to tackle. We need to allow women to progress up the income scale in the same way as men so that&#8212;I do not often argue for higher taxes&#8212;men and women pay the same amount of income tax.

	<p pid="d.1185.2/1">I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40654" name="Harriett Baldwin">the hon. Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)</phrase> that the Chancellor is a Goldilocks Chancellor&#8212;he goes around people&#8217;s houses nicking all their porridge. He and his colleague the Prime Minister are very much the brothers Grimm of Parliament at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="d.1185.2/2">I want to talk about the unquestionably disproportionate impact many of the Government&#8217;s policies are having on women. The north-east region, which includes my constituency, is particularly hard hit. I hope that Ministers take our points onboard and take the necessary steps to rectify the many issues in the region. I will focus on three areas: first, the unemployment rate among women, particularly the rate of long-term unemployment&#8212;those claiming for more than 12 months; second, pay equality; and lastly, the broader issue of the cost of living crisis currently facing women.</p>
	<p pid="d.1185.2/3">In May 2010, there were 20,657 female unemployed benefit claimants in the north-east. Last month, that figure was 25,973. That is a 25.7% increase. In my constituency, long-term unemployment among women has increased by 144% since the general election in May 2010. That is a shockingly huge amount and one that I am sure my colleagues would agree is completely disgraceful. The picture across neighbouring Teesside seats is no better. In Redcar, the figure is almost 157% worse, but worse still, in Stockton South, the increase has been a mammoth 205%. That is the increase in long-term female unemployment between May 2010 and October 2013.</p>
	<p pid="d.1185.2/4">While the Government might be able to present figures that show a small increase in employment, the jobs have tended to be in the south-east and clearly are not helping those unfortunately in long-term unemployment. More broadly, historically, the north-east economy has been built largely on male-dominated heavy industry, and while the more traditional industries, such as chemicals and steel, have had tough times recently, under the previous Labour Government, the area saw an increase in smaller scale, but highly-skilled industries and a diversification into other industries.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-19d.1186.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" speakername="Tom Blenkinsop" colnum="1186"  time="018:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#131119-0004.htm_spnew0">
	<p pid="d.1186.3/1">I cannot agree with that at all. The structural imbalance&#8212;I assume that the hon. Gentleman is referring to the staple industries in the north-east&#8212;has had a long-term effect primarily because of his party&#8217;s record in the north-east of decimating heavy industry back in the &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s. The increase in female unemployment is unprecedented. I have never before seen these levels of female unemployment. Previously, we had long-term male unemployment in my region. That was difficult, but families still had a working mother.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/2">Now, these families have unemployed mothers and fathers, meaning far more significant long-term consequences for my area. That is what I am frightened about.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/3">There is a big gender split in apprenticeships, because young women take a much narrower range of apprenticeships than young men, yet there remains a skill shortage in these new industries. It seems only logical, then, that all the stops should be pulled out to encourage young women seriously to consider these industries as a career. Increasing the number of women working&#8212;or at least taking up apprenticeships&#8212;in these male-dominated industries would go a long way to stem the flow from short-term to long-term unemployment. We must challenge the stereotypes in careers advice for young women and encourage more girls to take up higher skilled apprenticeships, but that has been made increasingly difficult by a Government who have undermined careers services. One of the Government&#8217;s first decisions was to get rid of Connexions, which was a careers advice service in schools giving children guidance on career paths.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/4">On equal pay, the gender pay gap stands at 15%, unchanged on the year before. We know that the reasons for the persistent gap are varied and complex, ranging from occupational segregation to a lack of well-paid part-time work and, even in this day and age, discrimination in the workplace.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/5">In August, the Chartered Management Institute found that women who have reached management positions can expect to earn only three quarters of the pay of their male colleagues. Even more staggering was the finding that the more highly skilled and highly paid the profession, the greater the gap between men and women&#8217;s pay. In modern Britain, undervaluing the talents and skills of women is a loss to the whole economy, so the issue of equal pay is a tough nut that needs to be cracked.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/6">Several actions could be taken to help that situation. For example, the introduction of mandatory pay reporting, including the Equality Act 2010, would highlight the differences between what businesses pay their male and females colleagues. We should improve the law on flexible working and do more to encourage businesses to utilise flexible working practices. However, the revelation that up to 50,000 women a year could be losing their jobs while on maternity leave is a shocking one, yet far from doing anything about it, Ministers are making it worse by charging women &#163;1,200 for challenging discrimination at an employment tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/7">To address the specific barriers that single mothers face, we Labour Members will support women who have to juggle work and child care by restoring breakfast and after-school clubs in primary schools from 6 am to 8 pm for every child, and provide 25 free hours child care for three and four-year-olds of working parents. Those are simple actions that the Government should seriously consider.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/8">My final point is on the broader issue of the cost-of-living crisis that women currently face. As we all know, women are struggling as prices continue to rise faster than wages, and the latest figures show that working people are on average &#163;1,600 a year worse off since May 2010.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/9">The Government&#8217;s change to the tax credits rules means thousands of families will have lost out on their working tax credits unless they have been able to increase</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/10">their working hours significantly. Any woman or any couple earning less than about &#163;17,700 will need to increase the number of hours they work from a minimum of 16 to 24 a week&#8212;otherwise, they will lose working tax credits of about &#163;3,500 a year. According to the House of Commons Library, this has hit 212,000 low-income families.</p>
	<p pid="d.1186.3/11">Of course, the situation was supposed to have been compensated for by the March 2012 Budget&#8217;s introduction of universal credit that was to come into force last month. To a certain extent, it would have restored families to a parity with what was seen with working tax credits under Labour. Due to the ongoing chaos in the Department for Work and Pensions, that has not happened. Some of my hon. Friends have mentioned the Tory free enterprise group and its proposals to increase the price of food and children&#8217;s clothes by 15%.</p>

	<p pid="d.1188.1/1">No.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.1/2">This group of 42 Tory MPs see it as necessary to raise VAT on gas and electricity to 15%, which would add &#163;120 to the average energy bill. Let me remind the House that when the Prime Minister was an adviser to the Chancellor of the Exchequer under the previous Conservative Government, he advised that Chancellor to bring in VAT on fuel. He also advised that Chancellor to bring in air passenger duty and the fuel duty escalator. VAT has risen under every Conservative Government since it was introduced&#8212;another fact for Government Members to ponder. That is an illustration of the Tory addiction to indirect taxation.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.1/3">For women, there is an even harsher reality. There is an increasing financial burden on women with many, particularly over 40-year-olds, prioritising supporting their children over building up a pension pot. Many have to find the money for family caring responsibilities or to pay off debts. Disproportionately stuck on pay below the living wage rate, 27% of women are not paid the living wage, compared with 16% of men. This gap is especially distressing now that mothers are either the breadwinners or co-breadwinners for their families in many households.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.1/4">The future is not too bright either. Research by insurance firm, Scottish Widows found that only 40% of women put enough money aside for an &#8220;adequate&#8221; retirement&#8212;down from 50% two years ago, and the lowest amount since the number started to be tracked under Labour in 2006. On average, women who are saving are putting aside &#163;182 each month, compared with &#163;260 for men&#8212;a pensions &#8220;gender gap&#8221; of &#163;1,000 in contributions each year. The continued squeeze on the cost of living has made it much harder for many women not only to live an adequate and healthy lifestyle now, but to consider saving for their future and retirement. The gender pay gap, the opportunity gap and the oncoming pensions gap have played a significant part in explaining why it is imperative to bridge those gaps sooner rather than later.</p>

	<p pid="d.1188.2/1">It is a pleasure to contribute to the debate, and a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" name="Tom Blenkinsop">the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Tom Blenkinsop)</phrase>. He and I will have been the only two</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/2">males who have made formal speeches in a debate on women and the cost of living, and I think Parliament should celebrate that.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/3">Following every election there is an increase in the number of female Members of Parliament, and I think we should be positive about that as well. I am a natural optimist, and I always look for the positive aspects of events. Today I was rather saddened by Opposition Members&#8217; attempts to create a Dickensian view of our present society, because that is not a view that I recognise. I understand that there are challenges to be faced, and I understand that some families are struggling, but I think that we take a step backwards when we try to create an issue between men and women, and between women and men. In my opinion, we should look after every member of society irrespective of gender, and extend the range of the equality laws that have been passed over the past few years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/4">The issue of women and work has been raised in the debate. This morning I had the pleasure of opening the Hertfordshire Business Expo at Knebworth house in Stevenage. A large number of local businesses were represented, and many of the stands were staffed by females. Moreover, many of the business owners were female. In my constituency, nearly 30% of new businesses are started up by females. That too is a positive development that should be celebrated, and we should see more of it.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/5">I am interested in issues such as the employment of women in engineering, My constituency contains the headquarters of the Institution of Engineering Technology. Thousands of people are employed at Astrium, which builds 25% of the world&#8217;s telecommunications satellites, and at MBDA Systems, which builds complex weapons systems. Just under 4,000 are employed at GlaxoSmithKline, which develops pharmaceutical drugs, and whose research and development facility is the largest in Europe. We also have Fujitsu, and a range of other companies. However, 93% of the companies in my constituency have a turnover of less than &#163;1 million, and many of them are led by females.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/6">I am proud of the contribution that women make to my constituency and to society as a whole. I think that a suggestion that women are victims has been allowed to creep into today&#8217;s debate, but I agree with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40238" name="Sheila Gilmore">the hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore)</phrase> that they are not victims&#8212;although of course domestic violence is an issue: I deplore it, would support 100% anything that could be done in my constituency and throughout the country to reduce it, and believe that it must be stamped out.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/7">It is clear that young women often achieve more than boys at school, and that needs to be encouraged, but why is there a gap later on? Why do those young women not also achieve more in the workplace? Some Members on both sides of the House have tried to suggest that there is a structural issue, and that may well be the case, but I am never very interested in playing politics. What interests me is trying to resolve the issue that is in front of me, and trying to create an holistic society in which people can succeed. What interests me is aspiration. I want every young woman in my constituency who is at school or a college of further education, who is going off to university or who wants to set up a new business, to go out there and think &#8220;Yes, I can succeed.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/8">I accept that I am an optimist. When I was growing up I saw a poster in the 1992 election which read &#8220;What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.&#8221; So I will maintain my approach. <i>[Laughter.] </i>I am not setting my stall out; I am merely saying that we need to aspire, and to encourage aspiration. We need to say &#8220;Whether you are male or female, if you think you are good enough and want to give it a go, then give it a go, and let&#8217;s see how far you get. If you fall down along the way, so what? We will try to help you get up again so that you can have another go.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/9">That, I think, is what the Government are doing. They are trying to help by increasing the personal tax allowance, cutting tax for 25 million people and taking 2.7 million out of tax altogether. I do not care which party does this, but I should like income tax thresholds to rise by as much as possible, because I believe that the best way of making it easier for people to deal with challenges involving their personal finances is to put money in their pockets and allow them to choose how to spend it, because they know what is important to them personally. I should like the threshold to rise to such an extent that no single person on the minimum wage need pay income tax. That would be a positive step for British society, and something I would wholeheartedly endorse.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/10">There has been a lot of talk about what we are doing in terms of child care. Some 800,000 three and four-year-olds are benefiting from the 15 hours a week of child care we give them at present. That is fantastic, and from next September we will be expanding that to disadvantaged two-year-olds, which is wonderful. I sound a note of caution, however. I worry about primary schools having extended hours where a five or six-year-old is dropped off at school at 6 am, perhaps, and then collected at 8 pm. That is a very long day, especially for someone aged five, six or seven, and we need to think about impact of that on the child and their family as they are growing up.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/11">I celebrate the women in my constituency, just as I celebrate the men in my constituency. We need to do everything we can to ensure that everybody does their best. I stand here incredibly proud that when the unemployment figures came out last week they showed that unemployment in Stevenage is now down to 3.7%. I have more women who are employed than men who are employed in my constituency. Anybody who is unemployed is one person too many, and we need to do all we can to support everyone.</p>
	<p pid="d.1188.2/12">I want to celebrate the contribution women, whether working or stay-at-home mothers, make to society, to my constituency and to the families up and down this country as they go out every single day. The reality is that they are all contributing in their own way and we should be proud of them and do everything we can to support them.</p>

	<p pid="d.1190.0/1">In Rotherham, unemployment among women is far too high. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, 13.4% of economically active women in Rotherham are unemployed. That is significantly higher than the regional figure of 8.1% and the national figure of 7.3%. While</p>
	<p pid="d.1190.0/2">there has been some fluctuation in this figure, it has averaged almost 15% across the lifespan of the current Government.</p>
	<p pid="d.1190.0/3">Unfortunately, these figures are symptomatic of a national trend. Female unemployment is at its highest for a generation. Over 1 million women in the UK are out of work, an increase of 82,000 under this Government. When we look at long-term female unemployment, the situation is much worse as it is rising eight times faster than for men. The number of women out of work for more than 12 months increased by 79,000 between May 2010 and August 2013, while the number of men out of work for more than 12 months increased by 10,000. The number of older women&#8212;those aged 50-plus&#8212;who are unemployed has increased by 42,000, which is up by more than a third, over the same period, while male unemployment in this age group has fallen by 15,000. Black minority ethnic women also have a disproportionately high level of unemployment than men.</p>
	<p pid="d.1190.0/4">Where women are finding employment, their pay continues to lag behind that for male colleagues. Changes to in-work benefit left many women in Rotherham struggling to earn a living, in sharp contrast to the Government&#8217;s oft-repeated aim of making work pay. Furthermore, the increase in the cost of living has left many women facing an extremely insecure existence, and an even bleaker future.</p>
	<p pid="d.1190.0/5">A constituent I met recently shared her experiences, which are no doubt repeated across the country. A single parent, she desperately wants to return to work, but the huge costs of child care and cuts to in-work benefits mean that it is simply untenable.</p>

	<p pid="d.1191.1/1">I am sorry, but I do not have the time.</p>
	<p pid="d.1191.1/2">She is thus forced to choose between short-term, part-time and low-paid work or to stay at home. To make her situation worse, local amenities on which she relies are facing closure as a result of Government cuts to local authority budgets and to national programmes like Sure Start.</p>
	<p pid="d.1191.1/3">I want to mention two other issues related to the increasing unemployment of women. The first is the lack of role models for young women. It is very noticeable that this Government have only four women in a Cabinet of 22. Only 23% of this Parliament&#8217;s Members are women, the vast majority of them being Labour MPs. When we look at chief executives and board membership, this situation is, unfortunately, common. That is compounded by a lack of consistent careers advice in schools, and in some schools no careers advice at all, so how are young women meant to make informed career choices?</p>
	<p pid="d.1191.1/4">The other key consideration in respect of why more women are unemployed has to do with their caring responsibilities and lack of Government support for them. For younger women that is likely to be child care, while for older women it is more likely to be care of their parents or their partners. The support for both those groups of women to enable them to both care and work is being systematically chipped away. Not only is this bad for the women; it is also bad for the country</p>
	<p pid="d.1191.1/5">economically. The ultimate irony is that of the &#163;14.4 billion raised in 2014-15 through the additional net direct tax and benefit, pay and pension changes announced since the general election, &#163;11.4 billion&#8212;or around 79%&#8212;is coming from women and &#163;2.9 billion is coming from men.</p>
	<p pid="d.1191.1/6">House of Commons Library analysis shows that women will be hit four times harder by the new direct tax credit and benefit changes announced in December&#8217;s autumn statement, with women shouldering &#163;867 million of the &#163;1.1 billion raised. This situation is immoral and unfair, and it needs to change.</p>

	<p pid="d.1192.0/1">We have had a high quality debate today, and it has been superbly led by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40048" name="Gloria De Piero">the Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero)</phrase>. I also congratulate the Economic Secretary to the Treasury on winning the opportunity to open for the Government. I say that because it must have been a fiercely fought competition if it has resulted in the Minister for Women and Equalities&#8212;the one voice for women at the Cabinet table&#8212;and her Tory junior Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for Women and Equalities, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40383" name="Helen Grant">the hon. Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Mrs Grant)</phrase>, both being sidelined in favour of the Economic Secretary. It is just a shame that, having won that battle, she gave such a complacent speech. Anyone listening to her would think that everything in the garden was rosy for women. However, as we have heard in many excellent speeches, especially from Labour Members, that is far from being the case.</p>
	<p pid="d.1192.0/2">I want to pick the Economic Secretary up on one point. She accused my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40462" name="Lilian Greenwood">the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood)</phrase> of scaremongering when she pointed out that the &#163;1,200 fees were putting women off taking their employers to a tribunal when they had been wrongfully sacked because they were pregnant. I fear that the Minister might have been trying to play down the problem. Maternity Action, whose representative I met just a few hours before the debate began, submitted evidence to the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee that showed that only 3% of victims of pregnancy discrimination took their claim to an employment tribunal, and that the fees involved were cited as one of the significant barriers that women faced. I recommend that the Minister meet Maternity Action to learn some facts about the impact of this Government&#8217;s policies on women&#8217;s lives. I am sure that its representatives would be happy to meet her.</p>
	<p pid="d.1192.0/3">It is clear that the Prime Minister&#8217;s cost of living crisis is hurting everyone except the millionaires who are enjoying their huge tax cuts. It is women who are bearing the brunt of the pain and who are seeing their financial support slashed the most. New mums have lost thousands, &#163;7 billion has been taken away from families with children, and nearly 500,000 mums have lost up to &#163;1,500 a year in support for child care. It is women who are seeing the services that they value being hollowed out. Sure Start funding has been slashed by more than half in real terms over this Parliament, and there are now 578 fewer Sure Start centres as a result. Many of those that remain are cutting back their services and opening hours, or charging for sessions that used to be free. It is women who are facing the greatest pressures in trying to make ends meet.</p>

	<p pid="d.1193.0/1">Does the hon. Lady therefore disagree with the Office for National Statistics when it says that the equivalised, after-tax income for the poorest fifth of households has risen under this Government, and that that income has fallen the most for the richest fifth?</p>

	<p pid="d.1193.1/1">I just do not recognise those figures. Our figures from the Library&#8212;and any other figures that we have seen on this matter&#8212;show that women are &#163;1,600 a year worse off under this Government&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> It is true, and I will write to the hon. Lady and give her the figures.</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.1/2">Child care bills are rising five times as fast as incomes under this Government. Energy bills are shooting up at similar speeds. The weekly shop is getting even more expensive, and real incomes are down by between &#163;1,500 and &#163;1,600 as prices have outstripped wages in 40 of the 41 months of this Government. Women&#8217;s long-term unemployment is up 80,000 since the election, compared with a figure of 10,000 for men. Older women&#8217;s unemployment is up by a third, while the figure for men has marginally fallen. More than 1 million women are unemployed, and countless others are stuck in low-paid, insecure jobs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.1/3">It is women who are struggling to get by over the long school summer holidays, with extra child care to pay for, school uniforms to buy and extra food to put on the table, yet we hear from the Government that they want to slap 15% VAT on the school uniforms on our children&#8217;s backs, on the cereal in their bowls and even on the electricity that lights their homes. How out of touch can the Government get? Despite all that, women hold the key to building a sustainable economic recovery that works for everyone. Millions of women want to get back into work or to increase their hours.</p>

	<p pid="d.1193.2/1">My hon. Friend is giving a great speech. Are women who work in social care not one of the most tragic cases of women struggling with the hours? Often they are not even paid the minimum wage any more, because they get an hour here and an hour there and do not get paid for travel. These women may want to work 45 or 50 hours a week but end up working only 20 hours. Is that not something we should be ashamed of: the most important job we have, yet that is how they are paid?</p>

	<p pid="d.1193.3/1">I certainly agree with my hon. Friend, and I commend her on the excellent work she does and has done in this area for more than eight years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.3/2">If we could support carers and the other women we have been talking about in finding extra hours and finding a job we could add more than &#163;1 billion to our tax receipts, yet still it is women who face the biggest barriers to progressing in their careers. The reason for all that is because women are sidelined and ignored by this Government&#8212;and why should we be surprised? This Government have more millionaires in the Cabinet than women&#8212;in fact, women outnumber Davids at the Cabinet table by only one, and let us not forget the Lib Dems, the party with as many knights as women MPs.</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.3/3">We have another autumn statement coming up soon. The Chancellor could use that opportunity to make amends for the disproportionate impact of his decisions so far, but if it is anything like last year&#8217;s we will just see that unfairness entrenched. I am aware that the Economic</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.3/4">Secretary was not in the Treasury at that time&#8212;in fact, no hon. Ladies were in the Treasury at that time. Perhaps that accounts for the gross imbalance in where the Chancellor&#8217;s axe fell. If it does, I hope she will be able to tilt the balance back in women&#8217;s favour this year.</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.3/5">The hon. Lady quoted the late Baroness Thatcher, so let me reciprocate. This may be the first time, and will probably be the last, that I quote the former Prime Minister, but this one line sums up perfectly everything that is wrong with this Government. In 1979, she said:</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.3/6">&#8220;Any woman who understands the problems of running a home will be nearer to understanding the problems of running a country.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.3/7">I may have spent my early life suffering because of the policies she implemented, but I have to say that she had a point. Does it not explain why this Government have such a poor record? They are a Government led by a rich boys club completely out of touch with the problems that so many ordinary women face just to keep the money coming in, a roof over their child&#8217;s head, clothes on their child&#8217;s back, food on the table and their energy bills paid. They are a Government who cannot tackle the cost of living crisis women face because they have no idea what that crisis means to the people they are supposed to serve.</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.3/8">The Prime Minister knows that he has a problem with women. He even had to hire an extra adviser to tell him why women do not like him&#8212;as a women, I call tell him that for free. The Prime Minister has a problem with women because we know when we are being let down and we know when promises have been broken. Even if his party chairman tries to wipe any evidence of their ever making any promises off the internet, women have been let down and seen promises broken time and again by this Prime Minister, as we have heard today. These are promises on affordable child care, decent jobs, energy bills, tax credits, financial support, Sure Start and public services. Time and again women say they need help, and time and again they are ignored.</p>
	<p pid="d.1193.3/9">Government Members should be under no illusion: those same women will be looking at what they do tonight. These women will see the proposals Labour have put forward to help: real help now with finding and affording early years and school age child care; capital projects that create good quality jobs for women, not just men; and businesses supported to boost the incomes of women on the lowest wages. Those are the kind of policies that will help to tackle the cost of living crisis that women are facing now, today. They are kind of policies women want and women need. They are the kind of policies that women deserve to expect from any Government. But at the same time they are the kind of policies they know they can get only from Labour. Every vote against this motion from those in the Government parties&#8212;every Tory and Lib Dem who would rather please their Whip than stand up for women in their constituency&#8212;will be yet another reason for those women to give this out-of-touch Government the boot in 2015.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-19d.1194.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40225" speakername="Jo Swinson" speakeroffice="The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills"  colnum="1194"  time="018:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#131119-0004.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="d.1194.0/1">I welcome the opportunity to respond to this debate. How we manage to assist people&#8212;particularly women as that is our focus today&#8212;with the cost of living is undoubtedly an</p>
	<p pid="d.1194.0/2">important issue, and it is a positive thing to have debated it. It is always a great pleasure to be in one of the debates in which so many women want to contribute and speak. It reminds us of how it would be a much better Chamber if we had a better balance of men and women on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.1194.0/3">We have had some interesting analogies. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40654" name="Harriett Baldwin">the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin)</phrase> conjured up an image of the Chancellor as Goldilocks. I must say that I found it slightly distressing to imagine the blond pigtails. The analogy was continued by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40401" name="Tom Blenkinsop">the hon. Member for Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland (Tom Blenkinsop)</phrase>. Perhaps the fairy tale theme is relevant to the debate. Unfortunately, many of the contributions from the Opposition Benches had something of the fairy tale about them and a bit of a reality bypass. Underlying the speeches was the suggestion that we can somehow wish away the deficit and avoid the difficult decisions that are necessary to get our economy back on track. I want to take a minute to remember the scale of the situation that we have been facing and trying to deal with for the past three years.</p>
	<p pid="d.1194.0/4">Our economy is recovering from the most damaging financial crisis in generations after a decade of growth built on debt. Of all the major economies, only Japan had a deeper recession. When we came into power, the Government inherited the largest deficit since the second world war. Our largest trading partner, the eurozone, has been in recession. We have had to deal with a significant set of challenges, and we need to look at this matter within that wider overall context. Of course it is important that the Government take action to help with the cost of living, and I will go into more detail on exactly what we are doing about that. The broader context is vital, and my hon. Friend the Member for West Worcestershire made a powerful contribution in which she demolished some of the myths and set that context out. The best way to help people with the cost of living is to build a stronger economy to create the stability that we need for employers to prosper and to create new jobs. That will help more people into work. Those are exactly the things that the Government&#8217;s policies are delivering.</p>

	<p pid="d.1195.0/1">What does the Minister think about the performance of the UK? Until recently, we were 18th out of the 20 countries in the G20. Is that the sort of economic performance that she wants the Government to take credit for?</p>

	<p pid="d.1195.1/1">The hon. Lady will be aware that we have the fastest growing economy in the developed world. I hope that she will not be as churlish as some of those on the Opposition Front Bench&#8212;although not those on the Front Bench today&#8212;and welcome that news rather than feel glum at the idea that the Government&#8217;s economic policies might actually be working.</p>
	<p pid="d.1195.1/2">Employment and work are the best way to drive up living standards. We have 446,000 more women in employment since the general election. We had some interesting exchanges about the numbers of women in employment and employment rates. Different individuals bring forward different figures to support their arguments. I argue that both the numbers and the rate are important.</p>
	<p pid="d.1195.1/3">We have more women in work than ever before&#8212;fewer women are economically inactive&#8212;but the employment rate is also increasing. It has gone up 1.2% for women to 66.8% since May 2010, which is very close to its highest rate ever.</p>

	<p pid="d.1196.0/1">The Minister stated that work is the best way for people to progress and improve their position, but, as she will see if she reads the work of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, the problem is that the rate of poverty among children in working households is going up and three quarters of people in such households are in full-time work.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-19d.1196.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40225" speakername="Jo Swinson" colnum="1196"  time="018:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#131119-0004.htm_spnew15">
	<p pid="d.1196.1/1">We absolutely need to help more people into work. When people want to work extra hours, we need to make that easier and we have a raft of measures aimed at assisting people into work. Yes, we also want to ensure that when people are in work their jobs are of a higher quality and that they can have higher pay, but we need to do that in a way that does not threaten to increase unemployment figures.</p>
	<p pid="d.1196.1/2">The pay gap has been mentioned, and rightly so. The Government have given employment tribunals the powers to force equal pay audits on rogue employers who have been breaking the law on equal pay. Our Think, Act, Report initiative now covers nearly 2 million employees across 130 major companies to drive forward standards in gender equality in the workplace. The recommendations of and the Government&#8217;s actions in response to the Women&#8217;s Business Council report, the extension of the right to request flexible working and the introduction of shared parental leave are all important factors that will also support women in work.</p>
	<p pid="d.1196.1/3">Various Members raised the issue of pregnancy discrimination. I do not know whether I need to declare an interest in order to say that I think that is an appalling and horrendous practice. I have met Maternity Action on these issues and we have commissioned research through the Equality and Human Rights Commission to ensure that we have up-to-date figures on which to take the issue forward.</p>
	<p pid="d.1196.1/4">I want to reply to the point made by some hon. Members about the &#163;1,200 fee for employment tribunals. It is simply misleading to suggest that that is what any woman will have to pay in order to take up a claim. That is not what they have to pay to lodge a claim&#8212;that figure is &#163;200. There is a remissions regime for people who cannot afford to pay that amount and only in cases that go to a full hearing&#8212;a tiny percentage of the number of cases overall, and only about 300 each year&#8212;will the full amount be paid. Even in those cases, if people win it is likely that costs will be awarded and they will not have to pay. Although I accept that the Opposition should make legitimate points, it is important to be clear about the facts.</p>
	<p pid="d.1196.1/5">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40576" name="Stephen McPartland">the Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland)</phrase> talked about women in sectors in which they are not usually well represented, such as engineering. We recently had Tomorrow&#8217;s Engineers week where that was a major theme. The Government also launched the Perkins review, which outlined how important it is to get more women and girls interested in engineering.</p>
	<p pid="d.1196.1/6"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40694" name="Sarah Champion">The hon. Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion)</phrase> mentioned role models and they are important throughout the STEM industries. Of course, there is the Inspiring</p>
	<p pid="d.1196.1/7">the Future initiative, which I encourage hon. Members and those watching the debate to sign up to so that they can go into schools and act as a role model by talking about their careers and what they do. That will inspire the next generation so that they know that there is no glass ceiling and that they can do whatever they want.</p>
	<p pid="d.1196.1/8">We are providing significant support for child care, increasing early education for free for three and four-year-olds to 15 hours a week and extending it to four in 10 two-year-olds from the most hard-pressed households, as well as providing the &#163;1,200 per child per year tax rebate on child care costs. The rising cost of child care is an issue and it was not addressed under the previous Government. We are addressing it by extending the support for new child care businesses and increasing the number of childminders by making childminder agencies possible.</p>
	<p pid="d.1196.1/9">I want to mention Labour&#8217;s plans a little. Some sound very good, but one wonders where the costing comes from. Things will be paid for by the bank levy, but Labour&#8217;s bank levy has now been spent more than 10 times over. Here are the things that will be paid for by Labour&#8217;s bank levy: the youth jobs guarantee, reversing the VAT increase, more capital spending, reversing the child benefit savings, reversing tax credit savings, more regional growth funding, cutting the deficit, turning empty shops into community centres, spending on public services, more housing and child care. The same money cannot be spent twice, let along 10 times. The numbers do not add up.</p>
	<p pid="d.1196.1/10">We have improved the situation for older women, particularly pensioners, who suffered previously. Those who have taken time out of work to look after children faced significant injustice under the previous system. Our triple lock, which is raising the state pension&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="d.1201.0/1">On a point of order, Mr Speaker. As you might be aware, for the second time in recent weeks there has been an incursion into Gibraltar&#8217;s waters. I think that it is time that stopped. Has the Foreign Secretary indicated that he wishes to make a statement on the matter tomorrow?</p>

	<p pid="d.1201.1/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point of order. I have certainly received no indication that the Foreign Secretary is planning to come to the House to make a statement on the matter, but the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s timing is either well designed or fortuitous, because he is in the presence, as he raises his concern, of both the Government Chief Whip and the Leader of the House, so his words are on the record and will have been heard by those on the Treasury Bench.

	<p pid="d.1203.2/1">It is a pleasure to open this Adjournment debate on energy transmission infrastructure in my county of Carmarthenshire. In doing so, I am fulfilling two promises, one of which I made to the then Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2013-03-06">6 March</phrase> this year when we debated in Westminster Hall the proposed Brechfa west wind farm application, which he later approved. During the debate, I kindly informed him that I would seek a further debate if he approved the Brechfa west generation development without considering the infrastructure required to connect it to the national grid.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203.2/2">My reading of English planning law is that these matters&#8212;generation and transmission developments&#8212;should be determined together to help inform a comprehensive picture of the impact of individual energy projects. I said in the aforementioned debate that local people were being hoodwinked by the developers and the UK Government in not processing both together. I regret to inform the House that I share their opinions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203.2/3">I regret that I have to make a political point so early in my speech, but the Tories in my constituency have only one campaign, and that is to oppose wind turbines. I look forward to reminding the electorate of Carmarthen East and Dinefwr in the months ahead that it was a Tory Minister who approved the largest wind farm ever built in Carmarthenshire and who will now be responsible for the 20 metre-high poles that will service the development.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203.2/4">Secondly, I am fulfilling a promise I made to my constituents that I would seek this debate following two public meetings that my constituency colleague, Rhodri Glyn Thomas AM, and I held on this issue over the summer in the villages of Pontargothi and Pencader. In those meetings, there was not enough room in the various halls to accommodate those who wished to have their say. This transmission development has generated huge public interest in the north and west of my constituency. I will endeavour this evening to portray the arguments made to us as elected members so that they are now a matter of record.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203.2/5">It will be of little surprise to you, Mr Speaker, to learn that if I had my way these matters would be devolved. Wales is a net exporter of electricity, yet we pay the highest electricity prices of any constituent part of the United Kingdom and, regrettably, we have among the highest levels of fuel poverty. A key element of my party&#8217;s social justice programme for reducing energy poverty, therefore, is to obtain control over our energy resources. That is also a key part of our economic vision of moving our country from the bottom of the wealth table. I am glad to report that my colleagues in the Assembly will hold a debate on a votable motion tomorrow in the Senedd.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203.2/6">The electricity grid in Wales resembles our transport system: it moves east to west, moving resources out of Wales. The need for a Welsh grid is of paramount importance.</p>
	<p pid="d.1203.2/7">There is also the issue of democracy. These matters should be decided not by the Whitehall machine, but rather by the democratic institutions closer to the communities of west Wales. The regulatory framework put in place by Ofgem specifies that the only material planning consideration is cost&#8212;in other words, the cheapest option. That completely disregards the impact of the development on other key components of the Carmarthenshire economy, primarily agriculture and tourism.</p>

	<p pid="d.1204.1/1">I fully agree with the hon. Gentleman. I was staggered to read in the submission on behalf of the company responsible for the Brechfa west wind farm, RWE npower renewables, that tourism and agriculture were of low economic value to the Carmarthenshire economy. My constituency has more than 1,000 farms, yet multinational companies describe them as of little economic value.</p>

We share a constituency border on the River Teifi and he will be aware of the significant growth and potential for growth of the tourism industry in particular.

	<p pid="d.1204.5/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a valid point. Indeed, many tourism operators in my constituency believe that developments on this scale are a disincentive for them to invest further in the sector, which has been seen by all levels of government as a key part of our local economy.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204.5/2">Such is the scale of the proposed transmission project that there will be three different consultation processes before a final route is determined. We are currently in the middle of the first two consultation periods. One of the key elements of my submission to the first process was that local people feel that they are being excluded</p>
	<p pid="d.1204.5/3">and that the process has not been open and transparent, with only selected organisations and community councils asked to contribute and no full public engagement.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204.5/4">The first consultation period is extremely significant, because following this initial stage the development company, Western Power Distribution, will have chosen a preferred route from four options. All four routes begin in the north of Carmarthenshire near technical advice note area G&#8212;which is the Labour Welsh Government&#8217;s jargon for the concentrated wind-generating development zone in the Brechfa forest&#8212;and terminate at the National Grid substation in Llandyfaelog in the south of the county. That is a connection distance of more than 30 km.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204.5/5">Villages such as Cwmffrwd, Idole and Llandyfaelog more than 20 miles away from Brechfa forest will now find themselves affected by a project many miles away. As I have said, they have been hoodwinked by the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the multinational companies building wind farms in the north of the county, because the subsequent transmission project is a fait accompli.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204.5/6">To balance matters out, perhaps I should aim my guns at the Labour Welsh Government as well. They determined the strategic development zones for energy generation. In the case of the Brechfa forest, they did so in the full knowledge that the local electricity grid had insufficient capacity to service the power generated by the new wind farms.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204.5/7">It is no good Labour Welsh Ministers saying, &#8220;Nothing to do with us, guvnor&#8221;, and pointing the finger at the Department of Energy and Climate Change. It is a dereliction of duty on their behalf to have selected strategic zones, in the case of Brechfa, so far away from the national grid that this large transmission infrastructure project is now required.</p>
	<p pid="d.1204.5/8">More than 200 people attended the public meetings that I have mentioned. It is fair to say that feelings ran extremely high. The major concern raised with us during those meetings was the visual impact of the poles that will support the overhead cables envisaged by Western Power Distribution. I am not just saying this because I am a native, but because Carmarthenshire is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful parts of the entire British Isles.</p>

	<p pid="d.1205.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point. In areas of outstanding natural beauty, cables will have to go underground, but the Tywi valley, although extremely beautiful, is not designated as such and is therefore exempt, so that point is vital.</p>
	<p pid="d.1205.1/2">Carmarthenshire is known as the garden of Wales for good reason, with the Tywi valley hosting the National Botanic Garden of Wales and Aberglasney gardens, both of which are Welsh national treasures. During the public meetings I held on the issue, it was clear that only undergrounding the cables would be acceptable to those who attended.</p>
	<p pid="d.1205.1/3">That is the position of Carmarthenshire county council, which unanimously supported a Plaid Cymru motion:</p>
	<p pid="d.1205.1/4">&#8220;That Carmarthenshire County Council finds it totally unacceptable that the proposed Brechfa Forest wind farm(s) National Grid connection should be made via an overhead line supported by wooden pylons. As the Council itself has no statutory power in this matter, we ask the UK Energy Secretary to ensure that the connection cable is laid underground for its entire length&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="d.1205.1/5">There is a clear precedent for undergrounding in Carmarthenshire. The Llyn Brianne hydroelectricity scheme in the north-east of my constituency was connected to the national grid via 20 miles of undergrounding in 1996.</p>
	<p pid="d.1205.1/6">In a one-sentence reply, the developers have stated that the cost of undergrounding is prohibitive. In this case, however, that is simply not good enough. In an answer to a parliamentary question, the Minister told me:</p>
	<p pid="d.1205.1/7">&#8220;In 2011, National Grid commissioned an independent study to give more clarity on the practicality, whole life costs and impacts of undergrounding and subsea cabling as alternatives to overhead lines. The Electricity Transmission Costing Study, prepared by technical experts and overseen and endorsed by the Institution of Engineering and Technology was published in January 2012&#8230; It contains estimated cost ranges for overhead lines and underground technologies.&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="wrans/2013-07-08.66"><i>Official Report</i>, 8 July 2013; Vol. 566, c. 66W</phrase>.]</p>

	<p pid="d.1206.1/1">The hon. Lady makes a valid point. In Powys, the energy or transmission companies involved have decided to underground parts of the route. As the project is undertaken, I will certainly be making the case that the Tywi valley is protected in a similar manner to those areas of Powys.</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/2">That report tells us that cost ratios are volatile and that no single cost ratio comparing overhead line costs with those of another technology, such as undergrounding, adequately conveys the costs of the different technologies on a given project. The use of financial cost comparisons, rather than cost ratios, is thus recommended when making investment decisions.</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/3">However, Western Power Distribution, which has been tasked with connecting the wind farms with the national grid, has published only a simple financial cost comparison for the proposed project. It has not published any information on the lifetime costs of the project taking into consideration the installation, repairs and maintenance of the electricity cables and pylons. In its one-page underground survey summary&#8212;the only piece of information on undergrounding that has been published&#8212;Western Power Distribution states that the costs of underground cables would be &#163;986,000 per kilometre, compared with &#163;100,000 per kilometre for overground cables. I am sure that the Minister will share my constituents&#8217; disappointment at not being provided with a full report that outlines a full consideration of the lifetime costs of the project for both overhead cables on pylons and undergrounding.</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/4">The National Grid, to which the electricity will be fed, launched a report in 2012 on its approach to the design and routeing of new electricity transmission lines, which outlines some of the principles that it will apply to its plans. I will quote from it because it applies directly to the communities that the proposed wooden pylons will affect:</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/5">&#8220;We also have a duty to &#8216;consider the desirability of preserving amenity&#8217; when undertaking projects which includes impacts on</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/6">communities, landscape and visual amenity, cultural heritage and ecological resources. To satisfy this duty, we seek to avoid areas which are nationally or internationally designated for their landscape, wildlife or cultural significance, such as National Parks.</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/7">We recognise, however, that not all sites that are valued by, and important for, the wellbeing of local communities are included in designated areas. Our approach therefore ensures that we consider all of the potential economic, environmental and social impacts of proposed projects, not just those relating to designated sites.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/8">National Grid is seemingly taking an holistic approach, but the regulator, Ofgem, and the regional distribution companies appear to be operating on the basis of the cheapest up-front cost.</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/9">I will briefly mention other concerns that have been raised with me. Some have raised concerns over the health of the people who live near the overground poles. Others have expressed concern about the impact on wildlife and protected species. Many have expressed the concern that as the generating capacity is developed within the Brechfa forest, the wooden poles will have to be upgraded to metal pylons like those that service the Mynydd y Betws strategic wind farm in the south of my constituency. Some of my constituents are concerned about what will happen to the poles after the 25-year life expectancy of the generating development in the Brechfa forest. Many landowners were extremely angry that the developers had accessed their land without permission. That has caused grave concern to many elderly constituents of mine. There should be strict access protocols and I hope that the Minister will impress that on Western Power Distribution.</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/10">I will conclude by quoting the greatest of Welshmen, D. J. Williams, whose love for his milltir sgw&#226;r, the square mile of north Carmarthenshire, was unrivalled and was the basis of his patriotism:</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/11">&#8220;Os gellir dweud fod hawl ddwyfol i unrhyw beth ar y ddaear, yna gyda&#8217;r Cymry y mae&#8217;r hawl i dir Cymru, nid gydag unrhyw berson estron, pwy bynnag ydyw ef.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/12">That was translated by the great Welsh poet, Waldo Williams, as:</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/13">&#8220;It may be said that there is a divine right to anything on earth, the right over the land of Wales belongs to the Welsh nation, and not to any alien, whoever he be.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="d.1206.1/14">As the UK Government-sponsored Silk commission considers the second part of its work into further powers for Wales, its opinion polling clearly shows that the people of Wales want full control over their natural resources and the exploitation of those resources. I hope that the Minister is mindful of the sentiments that I have expressed this evening when he considers the application in due course. I am more than happy to again extend my invitation to him to visit my constituency. I am sure that he would be awestruck by the beauty of the Tywi valley and I hope that he would gain an appreciation of why preserving that purity is so important to the people of my county.</p>

	<p pid="d.1207.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40150" name="Jonathan Edwards">the hon. Member for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards)</phrase> on securing this debate and on raising this important issue before the House.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207.0/2">The need for and impact of energy network infrastructure is a complex and sensitive matter. I welcome the opportunity to explain why there is a need to upgrade the electricity network, to clarify the approach that is taken in deciding where and how new infrastructure is delivered and to explain how that relates to Carmarthenshire.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207.0/3">The existing electricity network infrastructure is ageing. Much of it dates from the 1950s and 1960s, so considerable investment is needed to replace those assets as well as to expand our networks to accommodate the new generation that we require and to keep the lights on for our constituents and businesses. That is particularly the case where new generation is located far from demand or where the existing infrastructure is insufficient.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207.0/4">Developers of new generation need the reassurance that the network will be delivered in line with their project time scales so that they will be able to generate electricity once their projects are completed. We should recognise that those projects are substantial, long-term investments and that timely network delivery is crucial to their viability.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207.0/5">Before turning to the subject of electricity networks in Carmarthenshire, it might be helpful if I explain the wider approach to deciding on new network infrastructure. Under the current regulatory framework, it is for the network companies to submit proposals for new network infrastructure to the regulator, Ofgem, and relevant planning authorities. The proposals must be based on a well-justified need case such as new generation connections or the maintenance of a safe and secure network.</p>
	<p pid="d.1207.0/6">The network companies also propose routes and types of infrastructure. In doing so they are required to undertake extensive consultation with stakeholders, and make a balanced assessment of the benefits of reducing any adverse environmental and other impacts of new infrastructure against the costs and technical challenges of doing so. Those requirements are set out in their licence obligations under the Electricity Act 1989 to develop economic and efficient networks, and to have regard to the preservation of amenity and the mitigation of effects that their activities could have on the natural beauty of the countryside.</p>

	<p pid="d.1208.0/1">Will the Minister assure the House that all alternative means of transmission will invariably be considered&#8212;for example, when grounding or &#8220;under-seaing&#8221; cables, or is it, as I heard candidly from an energy sector specialist that, &#8220;They won&#8217;t offer undergrounding or under-seaing as a choice because they are just too expensive.&#8221;?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-11-19d.1208.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40524" speakername="Michael Fallon" colnum="1208"  time="019:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131119/debtext/131119-0004.htm#131119-0004.htm_spnew34">
	<p pid="d.1208.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, I must be careful not to comment on the specific application that lies at the heart of that, but I repeat that in fulfilling their licence obligations companies must not only develop efficient and cost-effective networks but have regard to the preservation of amenity and the mitigation of effects that their activities have on the natural beauty of the countryside. That is the balance they have to strike in their applications.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/2">In addition to legal requirements to consider the wider impacts of new network infrastructure, Ofgem published in July this year information for stakeholders on how that should be taken into account. It clarifies that network companies are required to consider wider impacts and alternative solutions to overhead lines.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/3">That regulatory approach is reinforced by the Government&#8217;s energy national policy statements, which set out the framework for factors to be considered when consenting to an infrastructure project of national significance. It makes clear&#8212;this may help Opposition Members&#8212;that cost should not be the only factor in determining the type of network technology used, and that proper consideration should be given to other feasible means of connection, including underground and sub-sea cables. I hope that balanced approach provides some reassurance to those areas potentially affected by cables and pylons that the need for infrastructure is carefully assessed, and that alternatives to new overhead lines are considered seriously.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/4">Since costs and technical difficulties vary so much from project to project, it is important that each is assessed case by case to ensure that the right planning decision is taken each time. The Government consider the costs and benefits of undergrounding electricity lines important issues that need to be considered carefully. That is why my Department arranged for an independent study to provide clarity on the practicality, whole life costs, and impacts of undergrounding and sub-sea cabling, as alternatives to overhead lines. That report was published in January 2012, and its findings are generally consistent with the comparative costs that National Grid quoted when evaluating options on current projects. The report should provide a useful point of reference to inform the planning process.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/5">Let me turn now to the need for, and the development of, network infrastructure in Carmarthenshire. Consent for the Brechfa Forest West wind farm in Carmarthenshire was granted by the Secretary of State in March this year. The application for the electricity network infrastructure in Carmarthenshire to connect the wind farm will be decided by the appropriate planning authorities and Ministers. It would not be appropriate for me to give my views on the particulars of this project. However, I can say that I do recognise that many people feel very strongly about pylons and the impact they can have on the landscape.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/6">Effective consultation with local communities and other interested parties is a vital part of the planning and regulatory approval process. When making proposals</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/7">for new infrastructure, network companies have to demonstrate that alternatives were considered and why the preferred option is justified. That in turn must show that stakeholders have been engaged effectively. Western Power Distribution, the distribution network operator in Carmarthenshire, has started a consultation process that will continue throughout 2014 to seek views on route options for the wind farm connections. It expects to submit an application for consent to the Planning Inspectorate and it will ultimately be determined by the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/8">I am encouraged by the greater levels of stakeholder engagement and consideration being given by network companies to alternatives to overhead lines since the new planning framework was introduced. That is exactly the behaviour that the new planning and regulatory frameworks require.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/9">I thank the hon. Members who have participated in what is an important debate. Our challenge is to build a low-carbon economy based on a mix of energy sources that meet our environmental targets and our security of supply needs, and do so in a way that delivers value for money for our consumers.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/10">Meeting our future energy needs will require the expansion of our electricity network. Deciding where and how this infrastructure is delivered requires informed and balanced consideration of a number of factors, including costs, environmental impact, and the needs of local communities and the country as a whole. The planning and regulatory approval processes for new electricity network infrastructure require that stakeholders are consulted properly on these important decisions and that their views are demonstrably taken into account. This is now due to happen in Carmarthenshire where Western Power Distribution is consulting stakeholders in developing its proposals, and I strongly encourage all those with an interest now to engage with Western Power Distribution in this process.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/11" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="d.1208.1/12" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
