	<p pid="c.1.12/1">High street premises in the Cradley part of my constituency have been allowed to fall into a very poor state of repair, which is not conducive to their being brought back into use. What can my right hon.

	<p pid="c.1.13/1">I begin by congratulating my hon. Friend on the work that she is doing on this issue and on her support for the Cradley action group. As she rightly says, empty commercial properties such as the 19% in her council area have a corrosive effect, and I urge her council to use its existing extensive powers. I hope that our recent changes to permitted development rights will make it easier to convert disused commercial buildings in her area into homes.</p>

	<p pid="c.3.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend and his local council on the work they are doing to bring empty properties back into use. A reduction of 33% in empty homes since 2010 is a great achievement. He is right&#8212;tackling empty spaces above shops will certainly contribute to regenerating town centres. Two weeks ago I announced &#163;450,000 in grant for his council area, and I hope this will help.</p>

	<p pid="c.3.2/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on her successful defence of the local green belt, and her council on a 23% reduction in empty commercial properties. She is right that we need to see small derelict plots developed before there is encroachment on the green belt, and I am confident that together with the vigorous use of existing council powers, the new permitted development rights and the community right to reclaim land will help her achieve that objective.</p>

	<p pid="c.3.4/1">I certainly do. My hon. Friend is exactly right. Our new homes bonus for bringing empty properties back into use has certainly helped as there are fewer empty homes in her area than in 2010, but I note that the Conservative-controlled Wychavon council is using the new powers that we have granted to allow a 50% premium on council tax on long-term empty homes, but that Labour-controlled Redditch council is apparently not doing so. Perhaps she could urge the council to reconsider.</p>

	<p pid="c.3.5/1">One of the difficulties in this area in Ripon and other parts of North Yorkshire is getting landlords to engage&#8212;communities are often frustrated by being unable to contact the landlord and not knowing who they are. What advice can the Minister give?</p>

	<p pid="c.3.6/1">My hon. Friend is right. Notwithstanding the excellent work of communities in Ripon and Bentham and their Portas town teams, it is a frustrating and challenging issue. In some cases, the right to reclaim land will help, but local councils are best placed to compile a public register of high street landlords. Spurred on by him, I will now consider how we can give still further assistance.</p>

	<p pid="c.3.7/1">My local Labour council is working exceedingly hard to tackle some of the 2,500 empty properties in Hyndburn and also those in Rossendale. Does the Minister think that the introduction of a decent housing standard would make those properties more attractive to people to rent, rather than the dilapidated state that some are in at the moment?</p>

	<p pid="c.4.2/1">Already there is vigorous use. I remind the House that some two thirds of assets in this country are owned by local councils. We are now consulting on the need to get councils to declare a list of all their assets. We have also given additional powers on the right to reclaim that should enable local communities, and indeed individuals, to put pressure on people who own derelict sites to bring them back into use.</p>

	<p pid="c.4.4/1">What the Government intend by what the hon. Gentleman describes as the bedroom tax is a means of ensuring the effective use of existing homes, as over 1 million bedrooms are empty and a quarter of a million families are living in overcrowded homes. That is why we are tackling the issue, together with our plans to provide new affordable homes, something that the Labour party signally failed to do when it was in power.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40200" name="Andrew Gwynne">the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne)</phrase>, is not the problem that no real research was done before the introduction of the bedroom tax?

If that proves to be the case, will the Government change their mind?</p>

It was an unmitigated disaster. There are good reasons why people do not want to live above undertakers, butchers and off-licences. I urge the Minister to look at some of the previous attempts to resolve this and to realise that it is not as simple as it looks.</p>

In fact, about 40 authorities actually had an increase this year, because we have moved local government financing from the old Labour style of a begging bowl and &#8220;If you do badly, you get more&#8221; to a reward-based system whereby if an authority builds houses, it gets money, and if it brings about business growth through business rates retention, it gets more money.

	Abu Qatada (Deportation)
</minor-heading>

	<p pid="c.23.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the deportation of Abu Qatada. Yesterday&#8212;more than 10 years after this ought to have happened&#8212;Abu Qatada was deported from the United Kingdom and sent back to Jordan. On arrival in Amman, he was handed over to the Jordanian authorities and formally charged with the two offences of which he had previously been found guilty in absentia. He is now held in Muwaqqar prison.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/2">As hon. Members know, successive Governments have sought to deport Qatada since 2001. The long delays and significant costs that his case has incurred are down to the many layers of appeal rights that were available to him, and real problems with our human rights laws. I will turn to those issues later, but first I want to make it clear that the Government have succeeded in deporting Qatada by respecting the rule of law at each and every stage of the process. We did not ignore court judgments we did not like. We did not act outside the law. We did what was right. And for a civilised nation, that is something of which we should be immensely proud.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/3">Qatada&#8217;s deportation, which took place on Sunday morning, followed my issuing of a fresh deportation decision on <phrase class="date" code="2013-06-27">27 June</phrase>, and my further decision to certify any appeal that Qatada might have brought on human rights grounds as &#8220;clearly unfounded&#8221;. That meant that the only choice open to Qatada was between challenging my decision through judicial review or conceding that the game was up. Given the strength of the agreement we reached with the Jordanian Government in March, he accepted the inevitable.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/4">It is important to remember that the UK Government already had assurances about Qatada&#8217;s treatment in Jordan&#8212;assurances that have been upheld in the courts&#8212;but in February last year the European Court of Human Rights moved the goalposts and declared that his deportation would be unlawful because of the risk that evidence obtained through the mistreatment of others might be used against him. That was the first time ever Strasbourg had blocked a deportation on that basis. The treaty we agreed with the Jordanian Government puts the answer to that final question beyond any doubt. The treaty guarantees a fair trial for anyone deported from either of our countries. The treaty benefits both countries and I thank hon. Members in this House for ensuring its rapid ratification. It was the key that unlocked the door to deportation.<a href="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130716/corrtext/130716c0001.htm#column_5MC"><i>[Official Report, 16 July 2013, Vol. 566, c. 5MC.]</i></a></p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/5">Qatada&#8217;s deportation demonstrates both our commitment to abide by the law and our resolve to deport foreign nationals who threaten our safety and security. It also demonstrates the legal validity of our policy of deportation with assurances.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/6">I want to turn now to the lessons we need to learn from the case. The deportation of Abu Qatada has taken 12 years and cost more than &#163;1.7 million in legal fees for both sides. That is not acceptable to the public, and it is not acceptable to me. We must make sure it never happens again.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/7">First, we have to do something about the legal fees spent by defendants and paid by the taxpayer, not to mention the benefits they also claim. Secondly, we have</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/8">to remove the many layers of appeal that are available to foreign nationals we want to deport. Thirdly, we have to do something about the crazy interpretation of our human rights laws.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/9">The Government are taking action to address all three concerns. First, on legal fees and benefits, in the case of Abu Qatada &#163;220,000 of his legal fees were funded from his own accounts, which were frozen by the authorities, but the rest&#8212;some &#163;430,000&#8212;was funded by the taxpayer, and in many other cases foreign nationals we ought to be able to remove have their legal costs paid in full by the public. That is something my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary is addressing in his reforms to the legal aid system and I can also tell the House that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions is considering how we can curtail the benefits claims made by terror suspects and extremists whose behaviour is not conducive to the public good.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/10">Secondly, we need to do something about appeal rights. Through the Crime and Courts Act 2013, the Government have already legislated for the principle that in national security cases individuals should be able to appeal only following deportation to their home country, except in cases where there is a risk of serious, irreversible harm. But we will do more, and that is why I will introduce the immigration Bill later this year. That Bill will stop illegal immigrants accessing services to which they are not entitled; it will make it easier to remove foreign nationals; it will make it harder for them to prolong their stay with spurious appeals; and it will make clear to the courts once and for all that foreign nationals who commit serious crimes shall, other than in exceptional circumstances, be deported. I hope hon. and right hon. Members from all parties will give their support to that Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/11">I can also tell the House that my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary is considering ways to speed up the pace at which the courts hear national security cases, but those reforms can achieve only so much until we make sense of our human rights laws. The Government are already taking action to address the misinterpretation of article 8 of the European convention on human rights&#8212;the right to a private and family life&#8212;and we achieved reforms to the way in which the European Court works in the Brighton declaration.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/12">The problems caused by the Human Rights Act and the European Court in Strasbourg remain and we should remember that Qatada would have been deported long ago had the European Court not moved the goalposts by establishing new, unprecedented legal grounds on which it blocked his deportation. I have made clear my view that in the end the Human Rights Act must be scrapped. We must also consider our relationship with the European Court very carefully, and I believe that all options&#8212;including withdrawing from the convention altogether&#8212;should remain on the table, but those are issues that will have to wait for the general election. Today we should take quiet satisfaction that a dangerous man has been deported to face justice in his home country.</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/13">I know the whole House will want to join me in paying tribute to all the Home Office officials, lawyers, police officers and members of the Security Service who have worked on this case, as well as Peter Millett, the British ambassador in Amman, and of course,</p>
	<p pid="c.23.1/14">the security Minister, the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40466" name="James Brokenshire">the Member for Old Bexley and Sidcup (James Brokenshire)</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="c.25.0/1">The entire House should strongly welcome the work that the Home Secretary and her junior Minister have done to get Abu Qatada finally on a plane back to Jordan to stand fair trial. This is a good result for not just the Home Secretary, but the country. In his home country, Abu Qatada stands accused of plotting terror attacks against a school and tourists, and it is right that he should stand trial for those offences and for justice to be done.</p>
	<p pid="c.25.0/2">After Abu Qatada was granted asylum in this country in 1994, he began preaching hatred and praising terror attacks. He is a dangerous man whose values we in this Parliament condemn, and that is why successive Home Secretaries&#8212;Labour and Conservative&#8212;have worked to deport him with the cross-party support of the House and that of the country. I strongly welcome the work of the Home Office and the Foreign Office to keep pursuing the case over many years, and we should also welcome the work of the Jordanian Government and Parliament to pass the treaties that were needed.</p>
	<p pid="c.25.0/3">My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40090" name="Jack Straw">the Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)</phrase> agreed the first memorandum of understanding with Jordan in 2005, which led to the agreement of the British courts that Abu Qatada could be deported without the threat of torture, and the Home Secretary rightly built on that agreement after the 2012 European Court judgment. She was also right to pursue the legal route, rather than listening to those who urged her to ignore the law. Without the rule of law, we are not free.</p>
	<p pid="c.25.0/4">We should be in no doubt, however, that the case has taken far too long, so change is needed to deal with such unacceptable and costly delays. The attempt to deport Abu Qatada started in 2005. It took three years for his case to reach the Court of Appeal, another year for it to reach the Law Lords and a further three years for it to reach the European Court, and it is a further 18 months since then. That is far too long&#8212;too long in the British courts and then too long in the European Court.</p>
	<p pid="c.25.0/5">We will examine the Home Secretary&#8217;s proposal that layers of appeal should be removed for immigration cases, because we believe that the process needs to be speeded up and that slow justice is in no one&#8217;s interests, but I urge her and the Secretary of State for Justice to consider the practical and administrative reasons why such cases take so long. The European Court now has a backlog of 150,000 cases and badly needs major reform. However, Ministers promised progress while Britain chaired the Council of Europe, yet little of substance was achieved. The borders inspectorate has said that a quarter of foreign criminals are sent home and a third are given leave to remain, but that 40% are not deported simply for administrative and bureaucratic reasons, so those cases need to be tackled.</p>
	<p pid="c.25.0/6">The Home Secretary referred to the qualified right to a family life under article 8 which can be used in immigration cases, on which we have supported the Government, although that was clearly not the issue in the Abu Qatada case. She concluded by saying that she wanted to abolish the Human Rights Act and to consider withdrawing from the European convention, yet she herself has drawn on the Human Rights Act. She used it to prevent Gary McKinnon from being deported to the USA, but without the Act, she would have had no legal justification for doing so. It is unclear whether she wants no Bill of Rights at all, which would consequently mean that there would be little restriction on what the Home Secretary&#8217;s decisions could be, but will she confirm that the Government&#8217;s commission on a draft British Bill of Rights has replicated article 3 of the Human Rights Act, on the absolute prohibition of torture? As she knows, the central issue in the Abu Qatada case was always torture, which is something that we in Britain have always abhorred, so ditching the Human Rights Act and replacing it with her British Bill of Rights would have made no difference in that case.</p>
	<p pid="c.25.0/7">The Home Secretary made much in her statement about the importance for us, as a civilised nation, of not acting outside the law. However, if we were to resile from the European convention, what signal would it send to those countries that we are trying to persuade to adopt higher standards of human rights and to follow the convention, such as Russia, regarding the criminal justice system, and Turkey, regarding the treatment of Kurds?</p>
	<p pid="c.25.0/8">The Government have done immensely important work in the Abu Qatada case: deporting a dangerous man; delivering new legal deportation agreements so that we can remove people to Jordan and elsewhere, with new protection against torture in Jordan; and showing the British Government&#8217;s determination to pursue what is right while respecting the rule of law and holding no truck with torture. The Home Secretary rightly claimed credit for all those things in her statement, and reforms are needed to deal with the problems of this case. We are pleased that Abu Qatada has finally been deported and we cannot have such delays in the future, but she should put forward her reforms without ripping up the things that she has just achieved.</p>

Friend the Secretary of State for Justice is looking at that issue, because we all want to make sure that we can deal with these cases properly&#8212;with people having proper rights of appeal, so that we can ensure that their case is heard&#8212;but can deport people rather more quickly.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.0/3">The right hon. Lady then sadly spent quite a bit of her response on the Human Rights Act, my views on it, and what might happen in the future in relation to it. I make two points in response. First, what she fails to appreciate is the concern that Government Members have about the role of Parliament in setting laws that operate in the United Kingdom. That is one of the issues that we are looking at in relation to the European Court and its ability to deal with cases that are taken through the courts in the UK. Secondly, she rather churlishly suggested that nothing happened when we chaired the Council of Europe. A considerable amount of work was put in by the former Justice Secretary, the Attorney-General and others, and it led to the Brighton declaration, which is bringing about change in the way in which the European Court operates, so that is another success for this Government, who took that opportunity to make some changes.</p>
	<p pid="c.26.0/4">My final point is very simple. Members of the public cannot understand why, under the human rights laws that we currently operate, somebody who is a threat to this country is able to remain in it, year after year, without being deported. Frankly, if the right hon. Lady cannot understand that, she simply does not get it, and will not get an opportunity to be on the Government side of the House.</p>

There is no opportunity to take into account that balance of the human rights arguments. It is exactly that sort of issue that we need to address.</p>

I know that she has worked extremely hard over the past few years to secure this result; indeed, since becoming Home Secretary, she must have felt, to coin a phrase, that there were three people in her marriage. The critical part of all this has been the relationship with Jordan and securing the agreement of the King of Jordan. Will she look at drawing up treaties with other countries right at the start of the process, rather than at the end, as that is one way of removing people? Will she look at a fast track through the European Court for those cases that involve terrorism, so that they are dealt with more quickly than other cases?</p>

She will know, however, that the Liberal Democrats believe that she is fundamentally wrong to argue that repealing the Human Rights Act or even thinking of pulling out of the European convention would be in Britain&#8217;s interest. If we want to set an example of human rights for majorities as well as minorities, in Jordan and around the world, we must not pull out of the best guarantee that Europe has had of them, written by Britons, and working well for the past 70 years.</p>

Gentleman should not be surprised that I or indeed any of his Conservative colleagues in the coalition should stand up and talk about repealing the Human Rights Act, because we were all elected to the House on a party manifesto that had exactly that within it. In relation to the European convention, we do, I believe, as a country, have to look at our relationship with the European Court and the operation of the convention. We need to do so because of some of the cases that we have seen, and national security cases are a particular concern when we cannot deport someone for a significant period of time&#8212;if at all, potentially&#8212;because of the interpretation by the European Court of the convention. It is only sensible when beginning to work on this that we accept that all options should be on the table, and we do not rule anything out before we have done the work.</p>

In all the ups and downs over the years of dealing with this man, there was a time just a few months ago when it looked as if he might be freed from prison and freed from bail. The only option the Home Secretary would have had at that point would be to put him on a terrorism prevention and investigation measure. Given that at that moment she must have realised the inadequacy of TPIMs, what plans does she have to review them, especially as David Anderson has warned that early next year a number of dangerous individuals on TPIMs will be free to roam the streets?</p>

We have been co-operating with the Jordanian Government on this matter for some time now, and that co-operation has been very good, but I am pleased that the treaty we signed with them is more general and will apply in other cases as well.

	<p pid="c.30.3/1">The reason that large legal bills built up was because of the time it took, because of the various stages of appeal that were available to Abu Qatada and the fact that the European Court moved the goalposts in the unprecedented decision that it took early last year. It was because of that that we had to undertake further discussions with the Jordanian Government about the assurances that could be achieved, and of course our own Special Appeals Immigration Commission last autumn decided that despite those further assurances and its view that the Jordanian Government would bend over backwards to make sure that Abu Qatada got a fair trial, this one issue about whether evidence that was allegedly obtained by torture could be used had to be addressed. That is addressed, among other things, in the general treaty that we have signed. It is because there have been so many opportunities to appeal and because of the decisions that have come as a result of those appeals that the legal bills have built up.</p>

That is a very proper thing to have done. Does she agree that even before the enactment of the Human Rights Act, we probably would not have deported a terrorist suspect to be tortured or to face trial on the basis of evidence extracted by torture or to a country which might have used the death penalty upon that person? Does she also</p>

It is important that we have these assurances and agreements with other countries where there is a possibility, or where the courts have suggested that there is a possibility, that it would not be possible to deport an individual because of the situation they would find themselves in once deported. When the European Court made its judgment last year, I think that it failed to appreciate the changes that have taken place in Jordan and the work the Jordanian Government have done, for example to change their constitution in relation to torture. In a sense the judgment was unfair with regard to the Jordanian situation. Nevertheless, as a result of the judgment, we had to undertake further discussions with the Jordanian Government and put in place exactly the sorts of assurances and agreements that my hon. and learned Friend refers to.</p>

	<p pid="c.32.1/1">I add my congratulations to the Home Secretary and the security Minister. We all agree that it is very good that Abu Qatada will face justice without the risk of information derived from torture being used against him. Since the Home Secretary is keen on ensuring that people are deported to face justice, can she confirm her support for a reformed European arrest warrant that does exactly that? She will know that only this weekend we saw yet another arrest of a Briton trying to evade justice in Spain.</p>

	<p pid="c.32.6/2">Of course, the right to a family life was not one of the arguments used at all in the Abu Qatada case, although there are foreign-national offenders who have used that argument.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-07-08c.36.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40593" speakername="Michael Gove" speakeroffice="The Secretary of State for Education"  colnum="36"  time="016:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#130708-0001.htm_spmin20">
	<p pid="c.36.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a statement on the future of the national curriculum.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/2">Our children are growing up in a world where the pace of change&#8212;economic, social and technological&#8212;is constantly accelerating. These changes promise wonderful new opportunities for future generations, but they also create immense challenges.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/3">We are learning more every day about how our world works and how our minds work, how we can develop our civilization and extend opportunity, and how we can improve learning and extend knowledge. At the same time, however, we are also discovering just how competitive the new world is. As other nations modernise their economies and education systems, we cannot afford to be left behind in the global race.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/4">That is why, when the coalition Government was formed, we asked officials in the Department for Education to analyse the best-performing education systems in the world. They examined the curricula used in the world&#8217;s most successful school systems, such as Hong Kong, Massachusetts, Singapore and Finland. Informed by that work and in consultation with subject experts and teachers, the Department produced a draft revised national curriculum, which we put out for public consultation five months ago. We received more than 17,000 submissions in our consultation and we have given them careful consideration. Today we are publishing a summary of the comments received and the Government&#8217;s response.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/5">The publication of our proposals has provoked a valuable national debate on what is, and what should be, taught in our schools. I have very much enjoyed this debate and the passionate engagement of so many great teachers and concerned parents. It is absolutely right that every member of society should care about the national curriculum. It defines the ambitions that we set for our young people, and I, like the overwhelming majority of parents, want us to be more ambitious than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/6">That is why we are demanding that children be taught how to write computer code, how to use 3D printers, how to handle more complex mathematical processes, how to appreciate a wider than ever range of literature, and how to speak, read and write in more than one language.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/7">The updated national curriculum framework that we are publishing today features a number of revisions to the drafts published in February. The revisions have been made on the basis of evidence and arguments presented to us during the consultation period. In particular, we have revised the draft programmes of study for design and technology and for history. We have included more detail on modern design processes and more coverage of world history.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/8">Other significant changes include the inclusion of a stronger emphasis on vocabulary development in the programmes of study for English and greater flexibility in the choice of foreign languages, which primary schools will now be required to teach.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/9">Perhaps the most significant change of all is the replacement of ICT with computing. Instead of just learning to use programs created by others, it is vital that children learn to create their own programs. By</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/10">demanding that children learn computational thinking and Boolean logic, we are determinedly raising the bar, but by equipping our children with the tools to build their own algorithms and applications we are also helping to foster a new level of creativity in our schools.</p>
	<p pid="c.36.1/11">It is my hope that these changes will reinforce our drive to raise standards in all our schools. I hope that they will ensure that the new national curriculum provides a rigorous basis for teaching and a benchmark for all schools to improve their performance, and I know that it gives children and parents a better guarantee that every student will acquire the knowledge to succeed in the modern world. That is why I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="c.37.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for notice of his statement. The national curriculum should be a vehicle for raising standards, promoting innovation and strengthening great teaching.</p>
	<p pid="c.37.0/2">Let me first pay tribute to the teachers, parents and pupils who have campaigned hard for changes to the Secretary of State&#8217;s original proposals. When did he come to the conclusion that it might be an idea for pupils to study climate change as part of the geography curriculum? When did he realise that speaking skills should be an integral part of the English curriculum? When did he decide to listen to business leaders, who warned him that the D and T curriculum did not include a focus on computer design and electronics? When did he decide that it might be an idea for children to study the history of China and India as well as that of our own country? Finally, when did he realise that it made no sense to limit the number of foreign languages that could be taught in primary schools? Surely it would have been a lot better if he had got his proposals right the first time round.</p>
	<p pid="c.37.0/3">The Secretary of State&#8217;s new curriculum will apply to fewer than half of all secondary schools. Academies have the freedom to innovate. If that freedom makes sense for academies, surely it makes sense for maintained schools as well.</p>
	<p pid="c.37.0/4">Why has the Secretary of State decided to abolish the levels by which teachers assess pupils&#8217; progress throughout their school life? The levels system is well used, particularly in primary schools. May I urge him to think again about that?</p>
	<p pid="c.37.0/5">The Department&#8217;s own impact assessment of today&#8217;s announcement warns of the risks for lower attainers and pupils with special educational needs or disabilities. How will the Secretary of State ensure that they, too, are challenged and supported and that their progress is measured effectively?</p>
	<p pid="c.37.0/6">The changes are due to be implemented in just one year&#8217;s time. How will the Secretary of State ensure that teachers are qualified to teach to the new curriculum when he is letting unqualified teachers into our classrooms? Is it not time for him to reverse the decision to relax the rules on unqualified teachers? What support will there be for continuing professional development and training on the new curriculum ahead of its introduction in a year&#8217;s time?</p>
	<p pid="c.37.0/7">The curriculum matters, but I am sure the Secretary of State agrees that what matters more is that we have a teaching profession that is high in quality and has</p>
	<p pid="c.37.0/8">high status and high morale. Does he accept that as a result of his policies and his rhetoric, teacher morale is at an all-time low? His divisive approach means that we have curriculum freedom for just some schools. Is not the time right for a reformed national curriculum that allows teachers in all schools the freedom to innovate, and therefore prepares young people for the challenges of the modern economy?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-07-08c.38.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40593" speakername="Michael Gove" colnum="38"  time="016:18:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#130708-0001.htm_spnew172">
	<p pid="c.38.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his questions. He asked me first when I realised that we should have climate change in the geography curriculum. I actually realised that before we published the first drafts in February. If he had looked at those drafts, he would have seen that we said that people should understand</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/2">&#8220;place-based exemplars at a variety of scales&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/3">and</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/4">&#8220;the key processes in physical geography pertaining to&#8230;weather and climate&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/5">In fact, the draft curriculum that we published in February contained more detail on the scientific processes behind climate change than the previous national curriculum, over which he presided. <i>[Interruption.] </i>All you need to do is read it, Stephen.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/6">Secondly, the hon. Gentleman asked about speaking. In the English curriculum as it was drafted in February, it was perfectly clear that drama, poetry and other forms of speaking were in it. If the Labour party does not believe that drama and poetry require speaking, I would be interested in its perspective on what exactly does.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/7">The hon. Gentleman asked about world history. It was perfectly clear that there were all sorts of examples of world history in the first draft, from decolonisation, invoking the spirit of Kenyatta and Jinnah, through to the impact that this country has had on the middle east, India and north America.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/8">In all those areas, we have listened and made revisions. My mother always said that self-praise is no honour, so I shall not lavish any praise on myself&#8212;I will instead lavish it on my fellow Ministers at the Department for Education. They listened extensively to the best in the field, and we have revised the curriculum. Judging from the fact that the hon. Gentleman did not take exception to anything in the current draft, I presume that he thinks it is an A* curriculum. I will take his comments as an endorsement.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/9">The hon. Gentleman asked about level descriptors. They are widely mistrusted by the very best in the teaching profession, which is why outstanding teachers are moving away from them and why the very best academies, such as ARK and Harris academies, are developing their own methods of internal assessment. It is why Dame Reena Keeble, at Cannon Lane First School in Harrow, has her own method of assessing how children are making progress, which is far more popular and rigorous than anything that we used to have.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/10">The hon. Gentleman asked about the risks for lower attainers. We are absolutely clear that because there will be higher expectations than ever before, lower attainers will learn and achieve more in school and be happier and more fulfilled later. Instead of the culture of low expectations that prevailed in the past, we will have a culture of higher expectations that values every child.</p>
	<p pid="c.38.0/11">The hon. Gentleman asks about curriculum support. Not only will the National Centre for Excellence in the Teaching of Mathematics be funded to provide improved mathematics teaching, but our national support schools will receive millions of pounds of extra money to ensure the required professional development. I have every confidence that teachers in our schools&#8212;the best generation of teachers ever&#8212;are up to the challenge. Whenever I visit schools, they say to me, &#8220;We want to ensure that our curriculum, like our teaching, is world class.&#8221; That is what we have delivered today, and I am delighted to have the, albeit grudging, endorsement of the hon. Gentleman.</p>

	<p pid="c.39.0/1">I congratulate the Secretary of State on the statement. Some critics suggest that if someone goes out with an idea, listens to feedback, thinks and goes out again, that is a weak form of policy making, but I say the opposite. As we have seen with qualifications, so with the curriculum&#8212;it is important to listen and this is a strong set of proposals. Will the Secretary of State identify all the risks concerning the time scale and scheduling of the proposals, and say what the Government are doing to ensure that implementation is as smooth as possible?</p>

	<p pid="c.39.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. It is right to put forward a proposition, consult on it and amend it when good advice is given. That seems exactly how the Government should operate. On the implementation timetable, as I alluded briefly in my response to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon. Member for Liverpool, West Derby (Stephen Twigg)</phrase>, we are supporting a number of centres of excellence, not just in mathematics and science but also outstanding teaching schools that are doing much to raise standards across the country and help deliver change. If evidence suggests that additional support is required in any area, of course we will provide it.</p>

	<p pid="c.39.2/1">Both you, Mr Speaker, and the Secretary of State now have a vested interest in all things John Clare, and the more John Clare on the curriculum the better as far as I am concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.39.2/2">On a more serious note, the proposals look encouraging. I like the consultation process that the Secretary of State has gone through, but I hope it can be further refined because some statements we have heard recently, including over the weekend, seem to suggest that he puts so much emphasis on the very brightest students, rather than on the broad panoply of students. We need the right teaching and curriculum for all our children, not just some of them.</p>

	<p pid="c.39.3/1">I could not agree more with someone who is increasingly my honourable Friend. First, the more we can do to support the work of the John Clare Trust in bringing that fantastic working-class poet to wider attention, the better. Secondly, the English literature curriculum includes for the first time a requirement to study the romantic poets, which I hope will be broadly welcomed. Thirdly, the hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and although we expect our brightest children to do even better, I hope the new method of secondary</p>
	<p pid="c.39.3/2">accountability&#8212;on which we are still consulting&#8212;will make it easier for all schools to recognise their responsibility and obligation to less able students.</p>

	<p pid="c.40.0/1">Liberal Democrats welcome the introduction of a slimmed-down curriculum, and the emphasis on teachers being able to teach and use their expertise. On continuing professional development and support for schools, there will now be a period in which teachers get ready to implement the new national curriculum. Will resources be in place, and will the Department do everything it can to give teachers confidence to move from one curriculum to the next?</p>

	<p pid="c.40.1/1">I am grateful for my hon. Friend&#8217;s support. What we sought to do is similar to what was argued for in the Liberal Democrat manifesto at the last general election: a core entitlement in foundation subjects and a far greater degree of freedom elsewhere. I am grateful to Liberal Democrat colleagues across the Government for the positive way they have engaged and the helpful suggestions they have made at every turn. It is right that my hon. Friend underlines the importance of ensuring we move speedily to get the right level of professional support. In particular, teaching schools&#8212;outstanding schools across the country&#8212;are generating networks of support and could not be more important. I want to do more to help them in the year ahead.</p>

	<p pid="c.40.2/1">The vast majority of parents and young people want a curriculum that is fit for life, including building life skills around self-esteem and confidence that will protect them from predators such as Jimmy Savile and Stuart Hall.

	<p pid="c.40.3/1">The hon. Lady is a passionate campaigner on ways we can better protect our children, and there are a number of things we can do. As she may know, I had the opportunity to talk to a group of outstanding young people last week at the Stonewall conference on fighting prejudice in education and empowering young people. They made some important points about the best of personal, social, health and economic education, and we must learn from the best schools and ensure that others follow their lead.</p>

	<p pid="c.40.4/1">As someone who has campaigned for some time for a greater narrative approach to history teaching in schools, may I thank the Secretary of State for retaining the chronological focus of the history curriculum, rather than the current &#8220;Doctor Who&#8221; style, time-travelling fantasy, in which pupils study the Romans, the Tudors and then the Victorians? What does he envisage happening to key stage 4 and the dovetailing with key stage 3, so that pupils will have the chance to learn narrative British history all the way up to 16?</p>

	<p pid="c.41.0/1">The Secretary of State will be aware that my constituency sends the fewest number of young people to university or college of any in the UK. One of the ways we are tackling that is through innovative early intervention, and by making great use of continuous assessment, which allows children from under-privileged backgrounds to gain the confidence to take some serious examinations at the end of the national curriculum. Would he meet with the six very hard-working head teachers in my constituency to understand how any changes to continual assessment will undermine their pupils&#8217; prospects of going to university?</p>

I am deeply concerned about the proposals to remove assessment levels, because tracking is so important in governors and parents, and young people themselves, challenging teachers and schools. How will tracking be done when the Secretary of State removes assessment levels?</p>

	<p pid="c.42.5/1">The hon. Lady makes two important points. First, by removing the current national curriculum levels we create space for more sophisticated methods of tracking. One of the problems with current level descriptors is that they are opaque and confusing, and sometimes different schools register different levels of achievement at different levels. The new method we propose will mean that there is far greater rigour in how assessment is carried out. Secondly, Darlington is a model local education authority, because it has encouraged more and more schools to take on academy freedoms. I hope that more Labour local authorities follow where Darlington has led.</p>

	<p pid="c.58.0/1">The parliamentary commission requested the Government to consider giving their response&#8212;and tabling amendments &#8212;well in advance of this Report stage, yet that has been given only this afternoon. Why are we faced with having to absorb this document at very short notice?</p>

	<p pid="c.58.1/1">I pay tribute to the hon. Gentleman for the long hours he has devoted to the work of that commission. The Government did indeed make a commitment on Second Reading and before then to make use of the Bill before us to take forward the recommendations of the commission. It was always intended that that should be at the House of Lords stages of the Bill, but I will have more to say about that in a few moments. We will absolutely give the required time to consider those amendments and to make use of a Bill that is before the House, enabling us to respond, rather than wait for a further piece of legislation.</p>
	<p pid="c.58.1/2">The commission&#8217;s central judgment is absolutely right:</p>
	<p pid="c.58.1/3">&#8220;High standards in banking should not be a substitute for global success. On the contrary, they can be a stimulus to it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.58.1/4">When I visited Germany late last year, I picked up a copy of <i>Handelsblatt</i> and was struck by a double-page spread with a picture of the City of London and the headline, in English, &#8220;City of shame&#8221;. That shows the impact of the events of the financial crisis and subsequently on the reputation of this country&#8217;s banking system. Exactly as the commission says, if we are to restore the system&#8217;s global success, as we must, it is imperative that we improve its standards.</p>
	<p pid="c.58.1/5">Therefore, in response to the commission&#8217;s report, I can confirm today that the Government will strengthen individual accountability by introducing a tough new regime that is recommended to cover the behaviour of senior bank staff; introducing new rules to promote higher standards for all bank staff; introducing a criminal offence for reckless misconduct by senior bankers&#8212;those found guilty could face a jail sentence; working with the regulators to implement the commission&#8217;s proposals on pay, specifically to allow bonuses to be deferred for up to 10 years and enable 100% clawback of bonuses where banks receive state aid; and reversing the burden of proof so that senior staff are held accountable for regulatory breaches within their areas of responsibility. We will also ask the regulators to implement the commission&#8217;s key recommendations on corporate governance. That will ensure that firms have to have the correct systems in place to identify risks and maintain standards on ethics and culture.</p>
	<p pid="c.58.1/6">We will support competition in the banking sector by providing the Prudential Regulation Authority with what the commission asked for, which was a secondary competition objective to strengthen its role in ensuring that we have banking markets that benefit from the</p>
	<p pid="c.58.1/7">vigorous competition that delivers good outcomes for consumers. That will be in addition to the Financial Conduct Authority&#8217;s existing competition objective. In addition to introducing seven-day account switching later this year, the Government will ask the new payments regulator, once established, urgently to examine account portability and whether the big banks should give up ownership of the payment systems. The Government have also implemented the commission&#8217;s recommendation to conduct a review to look into the case for splitting RBS into a good bank and a bad bank containing its risky assets.</p>
	<p pid="c.58.1/8">When the commission&#8217;s final report was published on <phrase class="date" code="2013-06-19">19 June</phrase>, I undertook to provide an accelerated Government response by way of a Command Paper before the summer recess.</p>

	<p pid="c.60.0/1">Of course, and today and tomorrow we will go into some further detail on that point. Let me mention one such finding, however: the Government do not agree with the proposal to abolish UK Financial Investments. I will mention various others later. We brought forward the publication of the response, which, just before the report was published, was intended to take place just before the summer recess, because I thought it was germane to the discussions in the House and I encouraged my officials to work their best to try to make it available for today and tomorrow. It has been sent to Members.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.0/2">Giving a Government response to an 11-month long, 571-page commission report in just 13 working days is, I think, quite an achievement and I thank my officials for losing a nice weekend watching the tennis to do that. I had hoped that it would help the debate.</p>

	<p pid="c.60.1/1">This is a very interesting situation. The Minister talks about the 13-day deadline and said that we had to get this done. Correct me if I am wrong, Mr Speaker, but I thought that the Government decided when the Report stage of a Bill was to be held, so the deadline was rather self-imposed. Why on earth are we wasting this Commons consideration of the Bill in Committee and on Report when he could not get his act together either to table amendments or to get a response together in time for us to properly use our time on Report?</p>

	<p pid="c.60.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is perfectly aware that the standard response time for a Command Paper responding to a report is two calendar months. That would have taken us into the recess, which clearly is not possible, so we would have had to respond after the recess. I think he is being churlish when I have asked my officials to move at great speed to respond in a very short space of time&#8212;13 working days&#8212;to make the response available. I thought it was better for us to have it for these debates than to have it next week or in September. I am grateful to my officials for their alacrity, even if he is not.</p>

	<p pid="c.60.3/1">I join my right hon. Friend in commending his officials for their amazingly speedy response. The only thing I would ask is that we should have plenty of time on Lords amendments. We had an excellent discussion in Committee, but unfortunately it was on a Bill that will be completely different from the one that is ultimately passed. To maintain the supremacy of this House, I feel it is important that we should have a proper discussion of and decision on the amendments that will be made in the other place.</p>

	<p pid="c.60.4/1">My hon. Friend, who was a distinguished member of the Public Bill Committee, is absolutely right. I have given assurances to the House before that we will have enough time to consider these very important matters, and we always have done. In Committee, we arranged things in such a way that we were able to consider every line of the Bill and every amendment and new clause with time to spare. When I saw the amendments that had been tabled, I made representations through the usual channels to extend what in the original programme motion had been a one-day Report and Third Reading. I had said that I would reflect on the</p>
	<p pid="c.60.4/2">volume of amendments and was able to secure an extra half day of consideration. I repeat that assurance&#8212;when the amendments return from the House of Lords, it is absolutely right that this House should have the chance to consider them all at leisure and thoroughly. My hon. Friend has my assurance on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.4/3">Let me turn to amendments 1, 2 and 3. In Committee, I gave a number of undertakings that I would table amendments on Report. One such commitment related to the effectiveness of the ring fence, which is the common denominator of the amendments in this group. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">The hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> will immediately spot that amendments 1, 2, 3 and 4 act on a commitment I gave to the Committee that in turn reflected the recommendations of the first report of the PCBS, on which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr Love)</phrase> and my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester served.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.4/4">For Members who did not have the privilege of being part of our discussions in Committee, let me set the context. The Independent Commission on Banking set three objectives for the ring fence: first, to insulate essential day-to-day banking services against shocks originating elsewhere in the financial system; secondly, to make banks more resolvable; and, thirdly, to curtail the perceived implicit Government guarantees to banks, which follows from the first two. The Bill turns those ring-fencing objectives into law by making them part of the statutory objectives of the regulators&#8212;the PRA and the FCA.</p>
	<p pid="c.60.4/5">Clause 1 amends the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to require the PRA to seek to ensure that a ring-fenced bank&#8217;s business is carried out prudently and protected against risks that might threaten the continuous provision of core services. FSMA is also amended to require the PRA to seek to ensure that the failure of a ring-fenced bank will not interrupt the provision of core retail banking services in the UK. Like any other bank that is poorly managed, a ring-fenced bank will be allowed to fail, but to avoid serious harm to the wider economy essential core services must be kept running, which requires the PRA to ensure that the business of a ring-fenced bank is structured in a way that allows it to be resolved in an orderly fashion, if that bank fails. Questions were raised in Committee about whether the resolvability element fully captured all circumstances in which the regulators might need to ensure that a ring-fenced bank could fail safely, so the amendments clarify the fact that the PRA must seek to minimise damage to the continuity of core services caused by not only the failure of a ring-fenced bank, but the failure of any other member of its corporate group.</p>

	<p pid="c.61.0/1">The new structure that the Minister is outlining looks good on paper, but the key to its success is the role of the PRA. How will he stop the problem of the revolving door that arose with the Financial Services Authority afflicting the PRA, because that would completely undermine the ring fence he intends to put in place?</p>

	<p pid="c.61.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. He will know from our proceedings during the passage of the Financial Services Act 2012 that we needed to reverse the catastrophic decision to take</p>
	<p pid="c.61.1/2">supervision of the banking system away from the Bank of England, which had always exercised that role with authority and commanded respect not only in this country but throughout the world. That Act corrected the situation, and the PRA is part of the Bank of England, as he knows, so we have restored that authority.</p>

He and I share an ambition that the north-east should be the home of such a bank, which would do wonders for the region&#8217;s economy, with its strong, vibrant business culture. The area would benefit from the local knowledge of such an institution. The PRA and the FCA were represented at the discussion, and he is right to reflect that everyone who was present on that Friday was enthusiastic about the steps the PRA is taking to make it easier for challenger banks to come forward.</p>

Amendment 1 requires the PRA to minimise the harm to the continuous provision of core services caused by the failure of other group members, as well as of the ring-fenced bank itself.</p>
	<p pid="c.62.8/4">Amendment 2 clarifies that the failure of a group company includes its insolvency. Amendments 3 and 4 reflect those same changes in the remit of the FCA, in the unlikely event that the FCA ever became the prudential regulator of any ring-fenced bank.

	<p pid="c.64.0/1">No. The right hon. Gentleman has not got it quite right. We are absolutely enthusiastic about creating regional banks, and the exchange that I had with my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham, and the changes made by the regulator to the approvals process, underline that. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40669" name="Pat McFadden">The right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden)</phrase> asks a specific question about whether RBS, in which we, of course, have a very substantial stake, should be broken up in that way. It is important that we have regard to value for the taxpayer. I suspect that we will talk about these things tomorrow, but I confirm that it is the Government&#8217;s view that we should not damage the potential value to the taxpayer in that way.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.0/2">As members of the Bill Committee will recall, I made a commitment to introduce on Report amendments to implement electrification, and here they are. The amendments give powers to the regulator, with the consent of the Treasury, to require a group to separate completely its retail and wholesale banking operations. The regulator would be able to require the group either to sell its interests in ring-fenced or non-ring-fenced entities, or to transfer specified businesses to outside ownership. The regulator will be able to require separation if it is satisfied either that the group&#8217;s ring-fenced bank is not sufficiently independent of the rest of the group or that the conduct of any member of the group is such that it undermines the regulator&#8217;s ability to achieve its new statutory objective to ensure the continuity of core services.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.0/3">The amendments set out a process for the exercise of that power. The first step is that the regulator must notify all affected members of a group that it is minded to exercise its powers and how it proposes to do so. The affected bank has the right to make representations following the receipt of each notice. Following that stage, the regulator is required to allow members of the group at least a year to take action to rectify the position. If, after that period, the regulator wishes to proceed it must issue a warning notice before a requirement to separate is imposed. The regulator would then allow five years to complete the separation required in line with the disposals required under competition law, particularly state aid interventions.</p>
	<p pid="c.64.0/4">As the parliamentary commission recommended, the Treasury&#8217;s approval is required before that action can be taken. We agree with the commission that providing for a deterrent against any bank that seeks to game or evade the ring fence is a sensible reinforcement in keeping with the recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking. Government amendments 11,12, 13 and 14 make technical adjustments to ensure that all the necessary components of structural reform comply with the ring fence and are brought within the scope of the ring-fencing transfer scheme.</p>

	<p pid="c.64.1/1">I am grateful to my right hon. Friend for his clear explanation of how the ring fence will work. He is discussing time frames that make sense in benign economic circumstances, but some of the problems with the interaction of retail and</p>
	<p pid="c.64.1/2">investment banking came about in circumstances of great financial trauma. Is he confident that the measures he has proposed will work in those circumstances as well?</p>

	<p pid="c.65.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. The use of state aid is often a response in the context of difficult circumstances. That was certainly the case in the financial crisis, and it happens in other industries as well. Five years is the standard period for these arrangements to be executed or completed, and that is the reason, anticipating an intervention from my hon. Friend, that period was chosen. I dare say, however, that that there can be reflection on that: my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester may have a different view that he may wish to share with the House later.</p>
	<p pid="c.65.0/2">Government amendments 15 and 16 reflect concerns expressed both by the Commission and in Committee that the use of ring-fencing transfer schemes to restructure groups could provide unscrupulous banks with an opportunity to shirk their responsibilities, such as liability with past misconduct. The requirement for PRA approval is a substantial safeguard against that, but Government amendment 16 requires that before the PRA can consent to a ring-fencing transfer scheme it must commission an independent report to assess whether anyone other than the bank itself would be adversely affected by the transfer. Government amendment 15 requires the PRA to &#8220;have regard&#8221; to that report in deciding whether to approve a ring-fencing transfer.</p>
	<p pid="c.65.0/3">The hon. Member for Nottingham East will of course have more to say about amendments tabled by the Opposition, but his first amendment was debated extensively in Committee. It requires a review of ring-fencing every two years. I am certainly not set against an independent review. Indeed, the Bill builds in future reviews, including the PRA being able to report annually on the operation of the ring fence, and being able to report every five years on whether the detailed rules it has made are still delivering the objectives of the ring fence. Requiring another review specifically to look at the case for full separation risks in many ways achieving the opposite of the Bill&#8217;s intention, which is to secure consensus, as far as that can be established, and to provide for a stable regulatory structure.</p>
	<p pid="c.65.0/4">It would be paradoxical for such a review to be confined to looking at ring-fencing or full separation, but not any other remedy for deficiencies that the review might uncover. Amendment 18 is identical to an amendment that was debated in Committee. The Government&#8217;s position is clear: in the Bill, we are following the advice of the commission chaired by Sir John Vickers, which considered the case for full separation&#8212;that relates to the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40121" name="Caroline Lucas">the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas)</phrase>&#8212;and rejected it. It is a different policy. I know that it has some distinguished advocates, but it is a different policy. Of course, any future Government could adopt it, but they should do so properly, through thorough analysis and following parliamentary and public scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="c.65.0/5">It is worth reminding ourselves briefly of the history of the proposals before us. They were not invented during the past few weeks or months. They go right back to 2010, when the Government established the Independent Commission on Banking under the chairmanship of Sir John Vickers. The commission produced three reports, instigated two public consultations, considered 1,500 pages</p>
	<p pid="c.65.0/6">of written submissions and hosted more than 300 separate meetings. The Government produced a response and a White Paper, on which they again consulted fully before coming to Parliament. At each stage there was full cost-benefit analysis. Now in Parliament each detail of the policy is being debated&#8212;and has been debated in Committee&#8212;and in many cases improved.</p>
	<p pid="c.65.0/7">The proposal for a further power is a much diminished version of the process that has been undertaken to produce this policy. It would bypass the process of meticulous consultation, consultation of experts and parliamentary scrutiny that ring-fencing will have had, certainly by the time the Bill reaches the end of its parliamentary passage.</p>

	<p pid="c.66.0/1">The parliamentary commission consulted widely and there was considerable concern about the weaknesses and the ring-fencing that had been suggested by Vickers. That resulted in a proposal for electrification. Is the right hon. Gentleman secure in the view that we have electrified the fence enough on the basis of the amendments he is proposing today?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-07-08c.66.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="66"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#130708-0002.htm_spnew64">
	<p pid="c.66.1/1">I will be even more secure when I have persuaded the hon. Gentleman, as I hope to do. He, being a fair man, will reflect on the fact that his distinguished commission undertook pre-legislative scrutiny of the proposals made by Sir John Vickers and his commissioners. Sir John did not recommend that there should be the power to separate. In fact, he has been persuaded by the institution-specific power of separation that his commission proposed, but has reflected in evidence to his commission that to go further and introduce a system-wide power is a separate matter and should come before Parliament in an explicit way rather than, as would be the case here, through a statutory instrument following an independent review.</p>
	<p pid="c.66.1/2">The proposals before us, most fair-minded colleagues would concede, fall very far short of the degree of scrutiny and rigorous assessment, including by the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s commission, that the current proposals have gone through. Parliament would not have the ability to present amendments to proposals and at that stage to take account of the recommendations even of the independent review. So the procedures proposed are less than adequate to the scale of the policy change that would be embodied in them. If we are to be serious about the need to respect the views and the role of Parliament&#8212;as I have made clear, these are important matters&#8212;we must accept that the only right and proper and democratic way of legislating for full separation is by coming back to Parliament with full primary legislation, including the rigorous process that we have undertaken.</p>

	<p pid="c.66.2/1">I very much agree with the case that my right hon. Friend is making. Is there not a danger with a fixation on structure, which the review advocated by the Opposition would promote, that we work less on making the existing electrification work and getting the behaviours right, and instead allow a focus on structure and the further review? As with any structure, it is possible to ratchet up, but it is also possible to ratchet down, and it would allow a nibbling of the electrification, which would not be constructive.</p>

	<p pid="c.67.0/1">My hon. Friend has some experience of these matters. I think that the debates about structure are important and that structural reform will make an essential contribution to making the system safe for the purposes of taxpayers. However, having looked into it, I think that to have hanging over the system the sword of Damocles&#8212;the origins of the metaphor were the subject of an erudite debate in the Commission&#8212;would introduce an uncertainty into proceedings that might distract from the important work of implementing the existing provisions.</p>

	<p pid="c.67.1/1">The reality is that we are seeking to balance conflicting issues. One respects the Government&#8217;s view that Parliament should be supreme in this regard, but the alternative argument, of course, is the one that the Minister has just put to us, about the sword of Damocles keeping the feet of the banking industry to the fire. We know that the industry has not been entirely with us in relation to setting up the ring-fencing arrangements and that it needs some encouragement to make it work effectively.</p>

	<p pid="c.67.2/1">The hon. Gentleman gets to the nub of the matter, because of course any attempt to evade the ring fence or to nibble the electric fence, as dangerous to health as that would be, could be undertaken only on the part of a particular institution, not the system. That is why we agreed with the Commission&#8217;s report&#8212;it was not part of the Vickers report&#8212;that it was necessary, for exactly the reasons the hon. Gentleman mentions, to have a sanction against that type of behaviour, and that is what we have done.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.2/2">A further power to separate the whole system could not be triggered by an individual and could not punish the actions of an individual institution. That is why I think that is a very different policy. It commands the support of some very distinguished and influential people. The Glass&#8211;Steagall approach, which of course the policy is modelled on, has its place in history, but I think that history also reveals that the Glass&#8211;Steagall arrangements were not immune to the very dangers my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40436" name="Stephen Barclay">the Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay)</phrase> pointed to. It is a good job my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester secured his amendment to the programme motion, because we are having a very interesting debate, but I would like to conclude, because there are other amendments that hon. Members would like to speak to. On that point, however, I urge the House not to allow at this stage the introduction of a very different policy into the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.2/3">Let me turn to the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, who I dare say will speak for himself in a few moments. I know that some of them were tabled to afford us the opportunity to discuss his Commission&#8217;s report, and I think that this is now established as a very relevant opportunity. I will of course listen carefully to what he says. I am confident that the amendment the Government have tabled in response to the Commission&#8217;s report can be improved during the Bill&#8217;s passage to take into account whatever concerns are embodied in his amendments.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.2/4">Amendment (a) to Government amendment 6 would add a new condition under which the separation powers could be used: namely, when the regulator</p>
	<p pid="c.67.2/5">&#8220;judges that there are serious failings in the culture and standards of the ring-fenced body or another member of its group.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.67.2/6">Of course, under the Government&#8217;s amendment the regulator would have the ability to separate the group if its conduct threatened to undermine the regulator&#8217;s ability to meet its continuity objective, but I think that, as the commission&#8217;s extensive deliberations showed, cultural failings might be present in banks that can result, for example, in significant harm to individual consumers or groups of consumers but nevertheless do not have systemic consequences. I think that the relevance of the proposed new power to take into account the culture is adequately covered under the provisions already in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.67.2/7">Amendments (b) to (p) concern the procedures for exercising the separation power. They would remove from the process: the second and third preliminary notice stages that extend to six weeks the time for banks to make representations; the requirement that the group be given a minimum of five years to effect separation; and the requirement for Treasury consent before a group can be required to separate. It is, of course, essential that a clear process be established for the exercise of the separation power. As I have said, I will listen carefully to what my hon. Friend says about reducing the number of warnings, which I think is the essence of what he is recommending, and about departing from the standard practice in financial services of allowing 14 days, rather than the six weeks that he proposes, for representations.</p>

	<p pid="c.68.1/1">As I have said, I shall hear from my hon. Friend. I do not think there is any difference of intent between us; we have accepted the commission&#8217;s recommendation. We have taken the period of five years because that is the standard time for the disposal of assets when they are required through competition law proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="c.68.1/2">I am certainly concerned, however, that the banks should be given a chance to address the concerns, and that chance would be lost if amendment (k) were followed. If amendment (p) were followed, we would deny banks the five-year period for divestments to be made that is typical under competition law. But as I have said, I remain open to considering these matters further during the Bill&#8217;s passage. I am confident that it can be improved to meet the concern, as I know that there is no disagreement in principle between me and my hon. Friend on the issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.68.1/3">The requirement for Treasury consent follows from the commission&#8217;s own recommendation, without which the regulator could, on its own initiative, instigate radical structural reforms.</p>
	<p pid="c.68.1/4">Amendment 19 is retabled as an alternative to Government amendment 6, providing for the specific full separation power. As I explained in Committee when the amendment was previously debated&#8212;when the hon. Member for Nottingham East was channelling my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, as he frequently</p>
	<p pid="c.68.1/5">did&#8212;it suffers from technical flaws. That is why I committed to introducing a Government amendment to deliver its objectives.</p>
	<p pid="c.68.1/6">Specifically, amendment 19 is rather vague, giving the regulator power to require a group to take steps to separate without specifying what those steps are. It also lacks provision for a minimum period over which groups must execute a separation, leaving the risk of the regulator&#8217;s ordering a rushed disposal that could be destabilising to the system.</p>
	<p pid="c.68.1/7">The Government amendment is intended to address those technical problems, although I have signalled our willingness to make any further improvements that may be necessary as the Bill progresses. I hope that my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester will be able to withdraw his amendment at this stage, pending further consideration.</p>

He is ever the swan on the surface, yet beneath the water line the chaotic paddling is evident from the Government&#8217;s response to the work of the parliamentary commission. That response was rushed out today, in accordance with the Government&#8217;s own artificial deadline of a debate on Report, which they could have scheduled so that we had time to consider where the Government stood on some of these issues.</p>

I do not know whether that is a whipping issue or whether other channels need to be reviewed, but something is not quite right.

Gentleman, as in Committee he tabled a whole set of amendments drafted by the parliamentary commission, saving him, I dare say, a lot of weekend drafting work. I think he might want to thank members of the commission and note that the recommendations from its first report were exhaustively considered in Committee.</p>

	<p pid="c.69.2/1">The right hon. Gentleman is right. Of course I thank them, but it is my sympathy for them that now requires us to speak in their favour. The Government ignored all those amendments. It is true: I have been channelling the wishes of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase> and, indeed, the rest of the commission. They dutifully drafted all those amendments and they were then totally ignored by the Government. The Government set up the parliamentary commission. They did not want to go for a broader independent inquiry; they wanted to take this route. They set up all</p>
	<p pid="c.69.2/2">the members to do all the work and have all the hearings. Their final report was more than a ream of paper&#8212; 570 pages. Not a jot of those amendments was accepted by the Government in Committee, and, significantly, the same applies on Report.</p>
	<p pid="c.69.2/3">Let us be clear about this. House of Commons consideration of this Bill is not worth anything; all the business is to be done in the other place by members of the commission who are there. It will go to them in October, presumably they will consider it in October and November, and then we will get a little chunk of time at the end of the process for Commons consideration of Lords amendments. I hope that the Minister will allow us a little more latitude to have a look at what is put into the Bill at that time.</p>

	<p pid="c.70.0/1">I think the hon. Gentleman is labouring under a misapprehension. The amendments in this group are a response to the commission&#8217;s first report. The essence of this Bill is the ring-fencing of the banking system. This is a response to the independent commission to which the parliamentary commission responded. The amendments implement these changes. The Government always made it clear that the final report on standards and culture would be taken on board during the Bill&#8217;s passage through the House of Lords. The situation is exactly as envisaged and perfectly orderly. He is not seeing the wood for the trees. This is about the ring-fencing of banks.</p>

	<p pid="c.70.1/1">Well, pardon me for daring to suggest that the Government have got this totally upside down and the wrong way round. They set up the commission and asked its members to come forward with recommendations, as they dutifully did, for which I thank them, and then ignored them in the Commons Committee and Report stages. That means that it is all to be debated in the detail that is required when the Bill reaches the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="c.70.2/1">Given that on Second Reading I suggested that much of the real deliberation would take place in the other place, it would be churlish of me to disagree entirely with the sentiments expressed by the hon. Gentleman. The situation was ever thus, given the parliamentary majorities. This has not been a chaotic process but, understandably, a holding response by the Treasury. It is a fast-moving situation. I suspect that a further banking reform Bill will be debated in the next two or three years.</p>

	<p pid="c.70.4/1">Some very eminent members of the commission are in the House of Lords, and I have absolutely no doubt that they will do a magnificent job of scrutinising the Bill. However, this is the democratically elected Chamber where most of the debate should take place, and it is incumbent on the Government to make time available for those at this end of Parliament to scrutinise it.</p>

	<p pid="c.70.5/1">My hon. Friend is 100% correct, and we have made our point; I now want to move on to issues of substance. There is a lack of time and we have to</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/2">finish debating this group of amendments by 7 o&#8217;clock. It is ridiculous that the commission spent hours on these matters but only a tiny amount of time has been allocated to debating them today.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/3">Government amendments 1 to 4 seem to be generally welcome with regard to the extension of the regulatory perimeter and the definitions of the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority. It is intriguing that amendment 4 centres on clarifying the definition of &#8220;failure&#8221;. It is very tempting to ask if they know what failure is, especially given their weak response to the parliamentary commission today, but I will move swiftly on.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/4">Government amendments 7 to 10 also seem to be fairly unobjectionable, although there appears to be a drafting error in amendment 8. Why has the Minister decided that the proposed subsection (3) should be inserted ahead of subsection (2) of FSMA? Something seems to be amiss, but that is only a minor point.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/5">More importantly, will the Minister talk about the tribunal to which a lot of the issues will be referred? What sort of tribunal will it be and where will it be situated? Will its work add to the functions of an existing tribunal? That is a small point, but I would be grateful if the Minister would address it.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/6">Government amendments 11 to 13 seem to focus on drafting issues. I cannot really see what will be achieved by changing &#8220;subsidiary&#8221; to &#8220;body&#8221;, but I do not have anything to say about those smaller, drafting amendments.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/7">The first main issue of substance relates to our amendment 17 on the need for a thorough review process of the ring-fencing of retail banks, such that it augments what ought to be the electrification of the ring fence. We suggested this in Committee and it was a clear recommendation of the commission. It would be better to have a proper and independent review of the adequacy of ring-fencing every two years. We think that a more robust review process would be better than the Government&#8217;s PRA-led approach. It would be inadequate for the regulators to lead the process. We need a broader and more substantial review process to ensure successive ring-fencing.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/8">Ultimately, as the commission itself has said, the jury is out on whether ring-fencing will work. It is fine in theory, but in order to keep a close eye on things&#8212;especially as these issues fall out of the media spotlight, as they inevitably will in the years to come&#8212;we must have a process in place that makes sure that we test, watch and scrutinise what happens.</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/9">The commission was right to be disappointed with the Government&#8217;s response. It noted that</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/10">&#8220;the Government did not accept our recommendation on potential &#8216;electrification&#8217; with respect to the sector as a whole. As our First Report noted, crucial doubts remain about whether all the intended reforms can be put in place and, even if they are, whether this will be enough to prevent the Government from having to step in next time a crisis hits. In particular, we identified the possibility that the partial separation of a ring-fence may prove insufficient.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/11">That is why we feel that a more rigorous and thorough review process that involves the commissioning of independent members to produce, together with the Chair of the Treasury Committee, a report for Parliament would be far more effective. I do not want to take words out of the mouth of the hon. Member for Chichester,</p>
	<p pid="c.70.5/12">but he is right to say that if we leave it to the PRA to do this job and do not have a proper and more thorough process, there is a danger that the regulators will simply end up marking their own exam paper.</p>

	<p pid="c.72.0/1">Following the logic of what the hon. Gentleman is saying, does he not agree that a better way of restoring public faith in banks and, indeed, in politicians would be to legislate firmly now for the full legal separation of retail and investment banking? Even if that is not what a large number of financial institutions want, would it not be better for the taxpayer and the public?</p>

	<p pid="c.72.1/1">We have tabled an amendment, which I shall discuss shortly, suggesting a clear back-stop power for the full separation of retail and investment banking across the board, in case ring-fencing does not work. We believe that we should give ring-fencing a chance, but it is important to note that the jury is still out on whether it will work. We just do not know. The Bill gives us the opportunity to ensure, as the commission recommended, that nobody has any truck with breaches of the ring fence. That must be the case both on a firm-by-firm basis for specific institutions and banks and for the sector as a whole.</p>

	<p pid="c.72.2/1">Given what the hon. Gentleman has just said, are not the titles of the proposed new section in his amendments 18 and 19, which refer to &#8220;full separation&#8221;, slightly misleading? I will support those amendments, because they would be a step forward from what the Treasury recommends, but the Labour party is arguing for electrifying the ring fence, not for full separation.</p>

	<p pid="c.72.3/1">It is true that we want to give ring-fencing a chance. That seems to be the broad consensus among those who have seriously considered the issue, either on the commission or elsewhere. However, it is important that we keep in our pocket the chance to do something serious and rigorous in case that plan does not work. I suppose we might call it a plan B, although I know the Government have an aversion to ever considering anything outside the narrow tram lines down which they career. It is important that we take this opportunity to put that plan in place.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.3/2">That brings me to the Government&#8217;s rather pathetic, lettuce leaf-like attempt to claim that they are adopting a back-stop electrification power. I am not sure what voltage the Minister has opted for, but for the Government to claim the provision as a firm-by-firm back-stop power is an insult to back-stop powers. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40669" name="Pat McFadden">the Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden)</phrase> said, the process in Government amendment 6 will take six years should ring-fencing fail, which is a snail&#8217;s pace. I urge hon. Members to look at the various stages involved in that amendment. First, the Treasury will look to the regulator to issue not just one preliminary notice but three&#8212;the idea of three preliminary notices seems like an impossibility&#8212;all of which will have different timetables. I do not know whether three preliminaries means, &#8220;We&#8217;re coming to get you, but not quite yet.&#8221; It is like the Education Secretary, with his firm, disciplinarian hand, saying to children, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to come and get you, but we&#8217;ll</p>
	<p pid="c.72.3/3">give you three preliminary notices before we do so.&#8221; The kids would be crawling all over the ring fence for months and years.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.3/4">After those preliminary notices, a warning notice will be issued, followed very swiftly&#8212;not&#8212;by a decision notice. There will be at least five steps over a six-year period. &#8220;Five strikes and you might be out in six years&#8217; time&#8221; does not strike me as an effective back-stop power for galvanising and electrifying the ring fence. If the Government recognised for six years that there was a flaw with ring-fencing but did nothing, their culpability would be almost equal to that of the banking sector. Amendment 6 could be an amendment to a misrepresentation of the people Act, and the Financial Secretary needs to take it off the table and instead consider the amendments that the Chairman of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards has tabled.</p>
	<p pid="c.72.3/5">This is a back-stop power in name only, and just because the Government say it is a back-stop power does not make it so. We need the ability, on a firm-by-firm basis at the very least, to take firm action to a timetable that shows flexibility and can be enacted swiftly if need be. I am afraid I tend to agree with the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Chichester. The provision needs to be truncated and the Government must withdraw amendment 6 as it is wholly inadequate. It would have been more effective to go with amendment 19 as drafted by the commission, which was a far more effective truncated version of a back-stop power on a firm-by-firm basis. That was far clearer, the drafting was improved, and it is a mystery to me why the Government have resisted it at every stage of the process. Whether that was due to lobbying from the banks, or because they do not believe in standing up to the sector and taking on this tough issue, the weakness of the Government on this matter surprises many people.</p>

	<p pid="c.73.0/1">Two things come to mind. First, there should be a sense of due process, which I think is present in the Government amendment. Secondly, there is genuine concern about uncertainty and the notion of an electrified ring fence. As the hon. Gentleman will know, I have questioned the whole issue of ring-fencing and the potential uncertainty it provides in this business, particularly in the fast-changing world we have seen over recent years. This is therefore a sensible response from the Treasury to the whole concern, which goes well beyond special pleading from the banking fraternity.</p>

	<p pid="c.73.1/1">Most of the debate we have had in the short time available has pressed for firm action to be taken towards a sector that&#8212;let us not forget&#8212;brought down the economy, created massive deficits in our public finances, and required rescue by the taxpayer because of a blurring of the lines between issues that affected ordinary households up and down the country and high-risk investment banking activities that needed strong safeguards. Simply saying that we will have ring- fencing with no means to enforce or police that&#8212;no &#8220;electrification&#8221;, as it has been termed&#8212;would make that concept totally redundant. That is why members of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards were surprised that the Government always seemed to take the path of least resistance&#8212;&#8220;Let&#8217;s not upset the banks too much; let&#8217;s try and go back to business as usual&#8221;&#8212;and are not learning the lessons of history.</p>
	<p pid="c.73.1/2">We have re-tabled amendment 18 not just to have a specific firm-by-firm back-stop power for separation in case ring-fencing fails, but to have sector-wide powers as a back-stop in reserve should ring-fencing not work. We have the capability for full separation, but the Government have stubbornly refused to put that on the statute book&#8212;&#8220;Oh well, if we have such circumstances we can always legislate further down the line&#8221;&#8212;as if passing a Bill on such matters can be done quickly or effectively in any way.</p>

	<p pid="c.74.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for the tone he is using on giving ring-fencing a chance and full separation being a back-stop power, or plan B, to be used only in certain circumstances. Amendment 18&#8212;the general requirement of separation and industry-wide potential for that&#8212;would clearly mean an end to universal banking, ring-fenced or otherwise. What consideration have he and his hon. Friends given to that issue, and particularly the transfer of cash between the two and the impact that might have on lending to the now retail sector, or lending for investment in business?</p>

	<p pid="c.74.1/1">Those issues were covered pretty substantially by the commission in its first and second reports, and this was the conclusion it reached. Nobody wanted to go for full separation if it could be avoided; we wanted to ensure that ring-fencing arrangements could be upheld and made to work. There are some arguments in favour of that universal model, and therefore it was felt preferable to have such a power in reserve, but in the Bill. It is no wonder that the banking sector breathed a heavy sigh of relief today, when it saw the Government&#8217;s response on this and other issues. The markets judged that the banking sector got off lightly, and that there was nothing tough or difficult for the sector. That is why we have seen the market reaction today. The notion of business as usual seems to be back on the table.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/2">I want the House to recognise that this is not an amendment that Labour has come up with in a partisan way. We are simply tabling an amendment that was drafted by the commission after days, weeks and months of deliberation and careful cross-party thought by Members of both Houses, but thrown back in the face of the commission by the Government today. It is important to have this on the statute book. A back-stop power will incentivise the banks to comply with ring-fencing. If the Government are correct in believing that ring-fencing will be adequate, the amendment will do no harm to the policy. It will sit dormant on the statute book. But if the Government are wrong, and this backstop power is not in place when it is needed, serious consequences could arise. It is nonsense for the Minister to ignore this risk, especially as the other place will want to come back to this issue. He may be forced to concede if we get into parliamentary ping-pong at some point.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.1/3">I do not want to take up too much more time because many other hon. Members have spent a lot more time on this issue than I have, but I wish that the Government would listen to them and to the commission.</p>

	<p pid="c.74.2/1">I shall say a little more than I usually say in the House because these arrangements are quite central to the work of the banking commission and give me an opportunity&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="c.74.2/2">my first&#8212;to explain some of the reasoning behind that work. The two key amendments that I have tabled would empower the regulator to split up a banking group if there were serious failures in the culture and standards of the ring-fenced body or another member of its group. In deciding whether these serious failures have occurred, the regulator would be required to take account of the recommendations contained in the reports of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which I chaired.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.2/3">We produced five reports about a vitally important industry, one that has become embroiled in very serious scandals that have cost the consumer, taxpayers and the whole country a fortune. The parliamentary commission was the first of its kind for a century. The last, exactly a hundred years ago, collapsed in a heap of partisan acrimony.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.2/4">We have produced five reports in under a year, all of which were agreed unanimously. We also put in an unprecedented amount of detailed work, taking evidence for 171 hours in no fewer than 76 evidence sessions, in addition to deliberating in private for a further 74 hours. I would like to thank my colleagues on the commission in both Houses for their huge contributions, injections of energy and endurance. I would also like to express my thanks for the equally impressive commitment of the commission staff and specialist advisers, led by Colin Lee and his two deputies, Adam Mellows-Facer and Lydia Menzies. Only the very limited time available prevents me from listing many more of the staff who put in so much work. I would also particularly like to thank the Front Benchers of all parties, who have offered a great deal of support.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.2/5">The task now is to get the report implemented, primarily by regulators and banks, and, where necessary, supported by statute. The Government have today responded to the commission&#8217;s most recent report&#8212;our fifth. I have had a chance to flip through the response, but there has been no time to digest it fully&#8212;it is about 80 pages&#8212;and, of course, no time for anyone to table amendments as a result. In view of the extent to which it looks as if the Bill has been changed, I would be grateful if the usual channels could consider recommitting this Bill to Committee. Failing that, at the very least&#8212;as the my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40441" name="Jacob Rees-Mogg">the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> has said&#8212;an extra day should be provided for consideration of what will inevitably be a mass of Lords amendments. Bearing in mind the struggle that we had to get the half-day tomorrow, I hope that the Government will show more flexibility about this extra time.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.2/6">Having said that, I warmly welcome the supportive tone of the pre-briefing given to the <i>Financial Times</i> about the publication that we have had today. Still, I would rather have heard about it here first. I am also very pleased that so many of the proposals and also the argumentation for them appear to have been accepted in full. But I am not fully reassured. The Government appeared to have accepted the commission&#8217;s proposal on a specific power to force the separation of an individual bank, but here we are, at the eleventh hour, trying to prevent the proposal from being severely weakened by the Government. In fact, as I will explain, the Government&#8217;s amendments would render the specific power of electrification virtually useless.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.2/7">Some of the commission&#8217;s important proposals have not been accepted at all, for example on leverage, on which we support the recommendations of the Vickers commission, and on reform of the Bank of England&#8217;s antiquated governance structure, on which the commission supports the recommendations of the Treasury Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.74.2/8">Other ideas that the Government have rejected include the need to wind up United Kingdom Financial Investments Ltd and the regulatory reforms to provide statutory autonomy for the regulatory decisions committee. I find that especially regrettable. The Government have also rejected the proposal to remove the FCA&#8217;s strategic objective. No one can see much purpose to this except the Government. It can be used to trump the operational objectives of the FCA, including that of competition, and can thus serve only to weaken those operational objectives. On all those issues, I hope that their lordships will repair some of the damage that we have been left with no time to attend to here.</p>

	<p pid="c.76.1/1">I strongly agree with the hon. Gentleman and I have already made both those points, which he just reinforced. All the amendments that I have tabled on behalf of the commission are about standards. Banking continues to suffer from the effects of poor standards. Even in the seven months that we took oral evidence, we had two more major LIBOR scandals, the interest rate swap scandal, a major bank found to be involved in money laundering in Latin America, and another fined $670 million for sanctions busting in Iran.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/2">It is sometimes suggested that trying to do much about this will drive banks overseas. But all of the evidence we took pointed to exactly the opposite conclusion. Far from imperilling the UK&#8217;s global competitiveness, high standards will make the UK a more attractive place to locate. Many good things can flow from higher standards in banking, among them is a restoration of trust. Trust is an essential bulwark to the UK&#8217;s reputation as a global financial centre. It is also vital for the British economy. While banks are not trusted by their clients and particularly by SMEs, there will be less lending and less economic activity.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/3">The crisis of standards and trust in banking&#8212;and it is a crisis&#8212;is multi-faceted and, so are the necessary remedies. None the less, the nub of the problem can be characterised as twofold. First, there has been a lack of individual responsibility at the top of banks. Collective decision making has diffused responsibility and a sense of duty to be vigilant. Secondly, there has been colossal failure of judgment by regulators, with an approach based on pointless data collection on a huge scale and needless box ticking.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/4">In a nutshell, boards were negligent and the system of regulation was found seriously wanting the first time it was tested. Both boards and regulators were motivated by an understandable desire to cover their backs, but their lapses were inexcusable. The lack of personal</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/5">responsibility in banks has been aggravated by misaligned incentives. By that I mean bonus and remuneration structures. They encouraged bankers to make short-term gains while the full risks and costs became evident only later. The taxpayer ended up picking up much of the tab.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/6">Of course, many others played a role in the crisis: Governments failed to put in place the right regulatory framework and got too close to banks; auditors and risk rating agencies took large fees and were found to be asleep; central banks, in the main, were slow out of the traps</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/7">The commission&#8217;s terms of reference primarily concerned banks. It is to their failings that our recommendations are primarily addressed, and I will speak to them today. The commission examined whether banks could be relied on to sort this out themselves, and we concluded very early on that they could not. We concluded that action was required on many fronts to improve standards. First, it would need to come from the ring fence, but that needed to be reinforced. Secondly, improvements to markets and competition would be needed&#8212;competition can often be the best regulator. Thirdly, corporate governance needs to be improved. In particular, it is vital to ensure that remuneration does not, as it has in the past, incentivise excessive risk-taking. Fourthly, regulators need to be better held to account. They need to be incentivised to do their jobs more effectively&#8212;a primary duty for Parliament. Fifthly, standards need to be supported by more powerful and effective sanctions in the hands of regulators.</p>
	<p pid="c.76.1/8">Standards will improve and the incentive to game the Vickers rules will diminish if, and only if, the ring fence is made more robust. If banks try to find holes in the ring fence, they should be at risk of full separation. We argued in our first report that that power should lie primarily in the hands of the regulator, and we called this additional power the electrification of the ring fence. The risk of the shock of separation would be an essential incentive to improve behaviour.</p>

	<p pid="c.77.0/1">My hon. Friend talks about the idea of incentives to find holes in the ring fence. Surely it is in the nature of the way in which one looks at regulation to try to find holes in the ring fence. There is nothing untoward about the idea of looking at a regulation or law and trying to find a way around it. Obviously, one should try to do so without breaking the spirit of the rule or regulation, but if we live in a highly regulated society it is surely inevitable that those who are regulated will look to try to find ways of avoiding them. Surely that is a fault of having over-regulated societies, whether in banking or in other fields of commerce.</p>

	<p pid="c.78.0/1">There is a heap of regulation surrounding the wielding of those scalpels. The common feature of the two industries is not the professionalisation or non-professionalisation of the industry; it is that both owe a duty beyond bettering themselves. In the case of the banks, they owe a duty because of the implicit guarantee; in the surgeons&#8217; case, they owe a duty to the patient. I will not prolong this discussion any further, but I think most people accept that we do not want banks constantly trying to find a way around or through the ring fence.</p>

	<p pid="c.78.3/1">How can anyone read the evidence that Mr Paul Volcker gave to my hon. Friend&#8217;s commission and come away with any other conclusion than that ring-fencing, whether electrified or not, simply will not work when we get the next major banking crisis?</p>

	<p pid="c.78.4/1">There is considerable force in what my right hon. Friend says. We considered the issue in great depth and published a report&#8212;the third report&#8212;on exactly that. We discussed the case for full separation, but concluded that although the ring-fence proposals had merit, they should not be reconsidered until we have given the Vickers ring-fence approach a try. We also examined the merits of a closely related proposal for the separation of proprietary trading&#8212;exactly what is being suggested&#8212;from the rest of banking activity. We concluded that further statutory support was not needed for that approach now, because the Prudential Regulation Authority might already have the powers to implement an effective separation of prop trading. We asked the PRA to present a report to the Treasury and to Parliament on its use of a range of monitoring and corrective actions, which could serve as the subsequent basis for a full and independent review of the case for full separation of prop trading. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell&#8212;I have had very little time to absorb this publication, which came out only at 12.30 pm&#8212;the Government have rejected even examining the proposal for prop trading. That is a mistake. I regret that, but I hope it will be put right in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.4/2">Returning to amendment (a), the Government accepted the case for ring-fencing, arguing that banks that test the ring fence should be strongly deterred and, if necessary, prevented from doing so. However, I am afraid that that will not be the effect of the Government&#8217;s amendments. On the contrary, the Government amendments almost guarantee that banks will not get a shock, and will not be discouraged from testing or gaming the ring fence. The regulator needs a useable and credible deterrent. This proposal creates too many obstacles and delays to the sanction of full separation.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.4/3">Frankly, it is inadequate for three main reasons. First, it requires the regulator to issue&#8212;we have already heard a little about this&#8212;no fewer than three preliminary notices and a warning notice before it can act. Secondly, it then requires the regulator to obtain permission from the Treasury no fewer than three times while the process is in train. Putting that requirement on the statute book would transfer most of the effective regulatory decision-making power away from the PRA and the Bank of England to the Treasury. It cannot be appropriate for the Treasury to be the regulator. The commission argued for a Treasury override at the end of the process, not at the beginning or in the middle, but the Government&#8217;s amendment requires the regulator to secure the consent of the Treasury on three occasions prior to that point. Even so-called preliminary notices&#8212;in effect, expressions of concern by the regulator&#8212;will require Treasury consent. That is absurd and compromises the regulator&#8217;s independence.</p>
	<p pid="c.78.4/4">The third objection has also been alluded to. The Government&#8217;s amendments allow at least five years for the completion of the separation after a decision has been made. That would create enormous scope&#8212;indeed, it would make it ideal&#8212;for lobbying for a change of heart in the interim. It would create far too much room for that and we can do without it. It also flies in the face of what the Minister said in Committee, where he alerted Parliament to the risk of what he described as an &#8220;inordinately long&#8221; delay in implementation. A tool that is so difficult and slow to use is likely to deter no one and that is why I have proposed a number of amendments that would remove some of the obstacles erected by the Government to taking action to separate banks.</p>

	<p pid="c.79.0/1">I want to ask the hon. Gentleman the same question that I asked the Minister about the difference in time scales between his amendments (a) and 19 combined, and the five to six-year timetable in total that the Government have set out. Were we to go down the road recommended in the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendments, how long does he think it would take between a decision on separation of an individual group being taken and that eventually happening?</p>

	<p pid="c.79.1/1">That is something on which we can usefully take advice from the regulator, but I would have thought that two years would be a reasonable maximum. Five years is ridiculous. It might take less than two years, but we have people down the road who can give us a clear view and the Government should ask them, if necessary publicly.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/2">I have also tabled an amendment that would give effect to the Banking Commission&#8217;s proposal for allowing for full separation, as well as trying to improve the Government&#8217;s faulty amendment a bit. I recognise that the amendment has been debated in Committee and that the Government said they did not like it, but their reasons for not liking it were frankly not strong. I still find it curious that the amendment was rejected as a starting point for putting in ring-fencing. When the Bill goes to the other place, I hope that that amendment might be seen to be a better starting point than the Government&#8217;s. The Government have had several months to get this right. It is regrettable that they have made so</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/3">little progress on it, but we are where we are. In any case, even ring-fencing with electrification is no cure-all for the standards problems in banks. To improve them, we all have to move forward on many other fronts.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/4">I would like briefly to refer to the main other areas that are needed. To improve competition, we recommended a range of measures. We asked the Competition and Markets Authority to initiate a market study of the retail and SME banking sectors. I noticed that the Government were so enthusiastic about that recommendation that they announced it as soon as they received the embargoed copy of our report. We asked the Government immediately to establish an independent panel of experts to assess ways of enabling much greater personal bank account portability. The Government appear to have ridden back a little from that in the proposals they published today, although I cannot be sure.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/5">We also took a good deal of evidence on RBS. Competition is weak partly because RBS is weak. Further restructuring may well be needed. In our view, the Government will need to be bold. We recommended that they undertake a detailed analysis of a good bank/bad bank split as part of an examination of the options for the future of RBS. That is vital work. In the field of banking reform, a healthy RBS, with the restoration of normal lending to the SME sector, is probably the biggest tonic that could be given to the British economy.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/6">The way in which banks run themselves also needs reform. An accountability firewall had grown up that allowed senior bankers to deny responsibility for their failings. That wall has to be taken down. To give effect to that, we proposed the introduction of a senior persons regime. This would ensure that the direct personal responsibilities of board members, particularly the chairman, reflected the importance of their roles, so that it was clear to bankers and regulators who should reasonably be accountable when things went wrong, and for what. Our study of HBOS&#8212;our fourth report&#8212;provided a clear example of exactly the opposite. It guided our thinking on this and a number of other areas. Senior board members at HBOS did not take responsibility for what went wrong.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/7">The crisis of standards was partly caused, and considerably inflamed, by the fact that bankers were rewarded for doing the wrong thing. Bonuses were often paid out well before the risks of the actions that they ostensibly rewarded became apparent. Bankers took huge rewards and when the risks turned sour, taxpayers picked up the tab. That has to stop. The Government and regulators should not set levels of remuneration. However, much more radical steps are needed to incentivise better behaviour among all staff whose actions or behaviour could seriously harm a bank, its reputation or its customers. Deferred remuneration for executives should not be viewed as an entitlement. People should keep their deferred bonuses only when it is clear that they have really been earned. That will mean long deferral, in some cases up to 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/8">What really stuck in the gullet of the electorate is the fact that many senior bankers, having received huge pay-outs for doing a bad job and having accumulated huge risks on bank balance sheets, walked away with those bonuses and even their massive pension entitlements. That has to stop, too. We propose that, in future, were a</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/9">bank to require direct taxpayer support, the regulator should have the discretionary power to forfeit the remuneration of those responsible and the unvested pension entitlements. That might require changes to employment contracts for senior bankers and possibly legislation, but it is essential.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/10">As for regulation, there is no point in creating a vast regulatory apparatus if it fails when we most need it; and we can now see the full scale of regulatory failure. Consumers have been ripped off in a series of shocking episodes, among them payment protection insurance and interest rate swap mis-selling. Taxpayers have also been ripped off. They have paid&#8212;and are still paying&#8212;the full price of the bank bail-outs. These were needed not just because banks were irresponsible and undercapitalised, but because regulators were not doing their job. Aspects of the Basel process have been farcically inadequate. In many cases regulators were scarcely even monitoring systemic risk in the run-up to the crisis. Much of their work was frankly a waste of time and money&#8212;ultimately, consumers&#8217; money. That is partly why we proposed that, at least for the time being, regulators should operate within existing cash limits, except where they have taken on new responsibilities. We need better regulation, not more regulation.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/11">It is our job in Parliament to watch the watchdogs. It is our job now to make sure that regulators and supervisors are more alert, but we also need to empower them. In theory, they already have a full range of civil sanctions, but we discovered that in practice they felt constrained from using them. The senior persons regime and licensing system that we propose will enable much more effective use of those civil sanctions. Responsibility for specific failures will be much more straightforward to identify once those regimes are in place. A major failing of the approved persons regime was that even where poor standards of behaviour were identified, those responsible were unable in practice to enforce the notionally large powers of civil sanctions.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/12">It is essential that those powers should be proportionately applied. It is partly up to Parliament to ensure that they do not become excessive and are not used in a heavy-handed way: it is up to Parliament to ensure that the regulators do not end up using those considerable powers in an arbitrary fashion. That also applies to a back-stop power that we recommended: a new criminal offence for senior persons of reckless misconduct in the management of a bank, which would carry a custodial sentence. The Government have accepted that proposal. It may never need to be used; but, intelligently implemented, it should change behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/13">We have been heartened by the initial reception to our final report, as with our previous reports. The big test now lies with the other place to amend the legislation to incorporate our proposals. We have been denied effective scrutiny in the Commons by the Government&#8217;s insistence on abiding by what amount to an arbitrary timetable and a rushed end date. Since we have already been hit by the full effects of the crisis, the rush is inexplicable. With a few extra months, the Bill could be immeasurably improved.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/14">What we do not need now is an orgy of further bank bashing; no good has ever come of it. We would all be the losers, but nor should Parliament or the Government wilt in the face of inevitable bank lobbying and water down these proposals. What we need now is to maintain</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/15">all party co-operation for reform, and to ensure that these reforms are implemented by banks, regulators and the Government.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/16">If they are implemented, they will complete a three-stage reform process. It began with regulatory structure: twin peaks. It was then taken forward by the Independent Commission on Banking, which gave us reform of bank structure: ring-fencing. In the third stage, the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards has sought to provide a fundamental reform and improvement of banking standards, on the basis of which we can create a more settled system of regulation for banks.</p>
	<p pid="c.79.1/17">All this is a great challenge, but it is also a great opportunity. It is an opportunity for all of us, and in particular the banks, to demonstrate a commitment to improving standards and to putting an end to the rip-off&#8212;of both the taxpayer and the consumer&#8212;culture that has marked recent years. It is also incumbent upon us here to show a preparedness to help restore trust by supporting banks where they show a willingness constructively to engage in implementing these proposals.</p>

	<p pid="c.82.0/1">I do not propose to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase> by making a wide-ranging speech on the recommendations of the banking commission&#8217;s final report, as he has set them out perfectly adequately. However, I do want to say that I do not think the Minister has served himself or this discussion well by publishing the Government&#8217;s conclusions at lunchtime today, and then coming along and making a de facto statement of new policy, thereby simply compounding the sense of frustration in this House about the adequacy of the procedures for discussing these issues. Instead of going over all of that in great detail, however, I want to concentrate on the amendments before us, and on the discussion of ring-fencing and separation. I specifically want to talk about amendments 17 and 18 in the name of the shadow Chancellor and his shadow Treasury team colleagues; and amendment (a) to Government amendment 6 and amendment 19 in the name of the hon. Member for Chichester.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.0/2">The banking commission&#8217;s first report, issued before Christmas, focused on ring-fencing and separation. It made two principal recommendations in respect of what has become known as electrification of the ring fence, which is the power to go further than the ring fence and enforce full separation between investment and retail banking.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.0/3">The first of those proposed powers was in respect of individual institutions, and it was accepted by the Government, at least in name. The second power was in relation to the sector as a whole, and it was not accepted by the Government. No convincing reason has been given for accepting one and rejecting the other. The Government have today tried to make a virtue of issuing a response to the banking commission&#8217;s final report which says they broadly support its conclusions, yet in terms of the legislation before us the Government are continuing to reject a major recommendation of our first report, and as we have teased out of the Minister, even in the document published at lunchtime, they are rejecting recommendations on UKFI and regional banking. We may learn about others, too.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.0/4">On the question of backstop powers to enforce separation in respect of either individual groups or the sector as a whole, one of the clearest lessons from the banking</p>
	<p pid="c.82.0/5">crisis of 2007-08 was how interconnected the banking system is. Institutions involved in banking are not islands cut off from one another. They lend money to one another. They engage in the same practices. Their culture is often shared. They place similar bets. When one falls, it often has the capacity to drag others down with it, as we learned to our great cost.</p>
	<p pid="c.82.0/6">The same is true of the standards and culture questions we examined in such detail after Christmas. The LIBOR fixing was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back in terms of the establishment of the commission, but that did not just happen within one bank. Groups of traders within banks were co-operating with one another to rig the interest rates, and groups of traders across different banks were co-operating with one another to rig the interest rates. Against that background, it makes no sense at all to restrict the policy armoury that this Bill establishes to respond to the undermining of the system by taking powers that will affect only individual banking groups and not the sector as a whole. As the hon. Member for Chichester said about our recommendation on new criminal offences, some of those powers may never need to be used, but their existence on the statute book should focus the minds of those running these major organisations.</p>

	<p pid="c.83.0/1">We also discussed at length the fact that, if we do not have the weapon in the armoury, we cannot use it, and it is usually too late to put it in place once a crisis comes along. Far better to have the gun in the locker, even if we never use it, than not to have it at all.</p>

	<p pid="c.83.2/1">To follow up on that point, rather than having a gun in the locker, some of these powers should be seen as akin to a nuclear deterrent. As parliamentary commission members will remember from doing the media rounds after the publication of the report, one of the big questions was whether Fred Goodwin would have gone to prison if we had had these powers in place. The answer to that is that RBS would not have gone bust in the first place. The deterrent element of these powers, rather than the enforcement element, is what is important.</p>

	<p pid="c.83.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a very good point. Without wishing to pursue this analogy too far, the difference between a gun in the locker and the nuclear deterrent is that it is conceivable we would use the gun in the locker, but less so the nuclear deterrent. I am therefore not entirely sure which of the two commission members has got this quite right, but deterrence is certainly part of the effect we are looking for.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.3/2">To return to the issue of the power to separate in respect of one institution or the sector as a whole, my overall reflection, having served on the commission for the past year is that, although its recommendations should be supported, even if we take all the steps set out&#8212;even if we put a new system of regulation in place, including the twin peaks system, even if we have the ring-fencing powers on structure that are in this Bill, and even if we faithfully implement the standards and</p>
	<p pid="c.83.3/3">culture recommendations to which the hon. Member for Chichester referred&#8212;it would still be rash to come to the conclusion that we had fully resolved the problems of too big to fail or too complex to manage. These reforms should be implemented and they can make a difference, but if we think we have fully resolved the problems of this huge sector, we will be guilty of complacency and possibly kidding ourselves. The problem of too big to fail is still there.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.3/4">Our recommendations will make a difference but we also need powerful weapons, even if their use is unlikely, to enforce good standards and to make those running banks think long and hard about the consequences before they decide to test or game the system in any situation in future. That is why I think my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> is right to say that a periodic review of ring-fencing and how it is operating is a good idea. It is why I support a more general power, to be held by the Government, to allow broader separation if the ring-fencing reforms do not work. That is what amendments 17 and 18 are designed to achieve and they are very much in line with the recommendations of the commission&#8217;s first report.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.3/5">I should also say that there is nothing partisan or party political about the amendments, and the Government do not need to be over-defensive when discussing them. All that my hon. Friend has been guilty of is trying faithfully to reflect in his amendments the work of the cross-party commission. So I encourage the Minister to respond with an open mind and not to think that it will reflect badly on the Government if they change their minds at this stage or have a second thought. I do not think this situation is like that, given the cross-party nature of the work led by the hon. Member for Chichester.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.3/6">I wish to say a word or two about the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendment 19 and amendment (a) to Government amendment 6. That is about the separation of individual groups, and there are two visions of how that should be done. The Government&#8217;s vision, as set out in amendment 6, has too many barriers and will take too long. Hon. Members will have been shocked at the notion that an in-principle decision could be made to act and things still would not be complete six years later. The amendment gives the appearance of accepting a recommendation to electrify the ring fence but does not give the reality. The Minister&#8217;s electrified ring fence would not shock a mouse, let alone a powerful, well-resourced, well-financed industry that is used to lobbying, used to gaming the system and used to getting its own way. So he should give careful and positive consideration to the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Chichester.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.3/7">The Minister said in his opening remarks, &#8220;Of course we will look at this. We will look at the wording and so on again.&#8221; I hope that the hon. Member for Chichester does not accept too readily such assurances, which can mean little in the long run. I hope he does not sell himself too cheaply when he decides later this evening whether to put his amendments to the vote, because, as he set out, there is a vast difference between deciding to go down this road in fairly sharp order and waiting six years. There is a big difference, in terms of both the bureaucracy and the number of hoops to be jumped through if one is serious about this, between the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendment and the elongated approach set out in Government amendment 6. There is a big</p>
	<p pid="c.83.3/8">difference between the Minister&#8217;s approach and that set out by the hon. Member for Chichester. We need more than warm words that the Government might think about this a little more in future. I hope that the hon. Gentleman will insist on a bit more than that before deciding not to press his amendments later this evening.</p>
	<p pid="c.83.3/9">In conclusion, we are dealing with a very important part of this discussion; it is stage two of these reforms, if we regard the regulatory changes as stage one. The commission believed that there was a relationship between structure and culture, and that is at the heart of the amendments. The recommendations for electrification aimed to reinforce that relationship to stop the kind of gaming of the system that has happened in that past and to make sure that the intention of the Bill is faithfully reflected in practice. That intention is well worth supporting.</p>

	<p pid="c.85.0/1">May I begin by apologising to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and to the Minister for the fact that I arrived after the start of the debate? The flight down was fine, but the Gatwick Express was not. Had it not been for that, I would certainly have been here.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/2">May I briefly echo the words of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase> in praising the staff of the commission, who did a truly outstanding job? One thing we did was to break out into panels&#8212;he chaired one, as did I and nearly everyone else at some point&#8212;where we had individual staff, and they were very impressive and helpful.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/3">I wish briefly to address a question raised by the hon. Member for Chichester, who chaired the commission, by explaining why I feel it is of the utmost importance that the proposals we made are not only taken seriously but passed into statute, and why we came to some of our conclusions. We deliberated on the issues for hours and hours. As anyone who has read the transcripts of the Treasury Committee&#8217;s meetings from years gone by will know, I started out seeing things from a full separation point of view. I am a fairly unreconstructed Glass-Steagall supporter, but I do think that one needs to be guided by the evidence. The commission received a great deal of evidence, and I came to the view that although that principle is still one that I adhere to and think is right, there were greater complications in today&#8217;s modern operation of the financial services and markets than perhaps had existed when Glass and Steagall got together and that it was wise, therefore, to listen on that. So what I looked for, as did other colleagues who came at it from different angles, was to give the best effect to what we were seeking to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40669" name="Pat McFadden">The right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden)</phrase> rightly said that the commission linked structure and culture, and I was struck by the way in which the different cultures in banking are competing. One of the easiest ways to look at this, whether we are considering the Volcker rule, prop trading or whatever, is that there are two distinct cultures in every large banking organisation. The first of those is the professional culture of the people seeking to work with and help individual clients, who are involved in investing or looking after depositors. I do not gainsay that the vast majority of people operating in the world of banking are professional, wish to be professional and wish to have high standards. The second is the completely separate trading culture, where there is no client at the end of the day; it is a zero-sum game where</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/5">two people, or two sets of people, are trading specifically to make money and to beat the guy on the other side of the trade.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/6">The problem so often was that although trading was necessary to give effect to that desired on the investment side, when the trading side took over in terms of profit and culture it infected the other side. The whole thing is about seeking to keep the cultures apart. People have talked about high-street commercial banking as being good and investment merchant banking as being a casino and being bad, but I do not take that view. I would split the types into three, because there is retail and commercial banking, investment banking and trading. All three have their uses, and how they relate and how they are governed is the important thing.</p>
	<p pid="c.85.0/7">The universal bank clearly works, but if all the banks are universal banks, it does not, and that is the problem with it. If everybody is pursuing the same model, there is a real danger that the riskier side infects the more prudent side.</p>

	<p pid="c.86.0/1">The ordinary depositor&#8212;the ordinary working person who puts their money in their bank and wants to use it&#8212;would be deeply worried if they felt, and if it were the case, that their money was being gambled with by these risk-taking buccaneers in the City. Is there not a very strong case for making sure that ordinary people, such as me, who do not gamble in that way can have their banking protected from such gambling?</p>

	<p pid="c.86.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes exactly the point I am in the process of making, but he does it more simply, and I thank him for that. That is the key point about the ring fence. The utility aspects of banking, which are operating the payment system and taking deposits, should be so constructed within an entity that when a bank fails&#8212;I say when, not if, because there will be another bank failure and our purpose is to try to make it easier for banks to be resolved so there is less likelihood of taxpayer intervention, meaning that the bank will be more likely to be allowed to go under and that bankers will be likely to be more prudent&#8212;the ring fence enables that while protecting the ordinary depositor and the payment systems.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.1/2">This is a long and complicated subject, as I learned over many hours, and the flow of capital from the lady who puts some money into the bank to the company that needs it to expand and grow the economy is necessarily complex. One must therefore be careful&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> I know that other hon. Members want to speak and I promised that my remarks would be brief, so before I get a beady eye from you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I ask <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40379" name="Kelvin Hopkins">the hon. Member for Luton North (Kelvin Hopkins)</phrase> to let me move on.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.1/3">The critical point, which I completely accept, is that the compromise we came to is the ring fence. The compromise holds good, however, only if the ring fence works properly. Our conclusion was that it would not work if it were not reinforced, and the term &#8220;electrified&#8221; was coined. The point made by the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East was that if one has at one&#8217;s disposal the ability to do something&#8212;the armoury, call it what you will&#8212;those who are engaged in the activity will check whether they are being looked at before they engage in it. It is the modern equivalent of</p>
	<p pid="c.86.1/4">the Governor&#8217;s eyebrow. If we do not have that, we will simply have a lot of regulation that might lead not to a successful conclusion but to a long dialogue that leads nowhere between the regulator, the Treasury and the institution. People must believe that when the weapon, whatever it is, is deployed, it will have a consequence. That is the essential point.</p>
	<p pid="c.86.1/5">In conclusion, I think all members of the parliamentary commission came to a unanimous view. We started from different viewpoints and with different concepts, but we agreed&#8212;all five from this House, all five from the other place: all 10 of us together&#8212;that to give effect to the ring fence it needed to be reinforced. We thought it could be done in this way and my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester has laid out the arguments perfectly.</p>

	<p pid="c.87.0/1">In following <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40138" name="John Thurso">the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase>, I apologise that transit issues meant that I, too, missed the start of the debate. I will take up only a little time in the Chamber today, but, following the comments made by the hon. Gentleman and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40669" name="Pat McFadden">the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden)</phrase>, it is important to make the point that it is not just those who have served the House well on the Parliamentary Commission for Banking Standards who have concerns about such issues and can see the difference between the Government&#8217;s offer and the amendments tabled by Opposition Front Benchers and by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the hon. Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.0/2">We talk about the electrified ring fence and, essentially, the Government are offering us a Fisher-Price electrified ring fence&#8212;a VTech model. They have looked up ring fence in the index of the Argos catalogue and gone for the one in the toy pages. There is not much point the Government&#8217;s saying they have taken everything into account, that this is the best model and that it will give everybody reliable assurances. Frankly, that is like trying to pretend that a tyre is flat only at the bottom and that this is just a minor stylistic difference about perception. The difference is about substance and reliability.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.0/3">I encourage the Minister to listen to what right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House have said, and particularly to those who have had the best insight into these issues through the parliamentary commission and who have changed and modified their views, like the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross. They have been able to give it more consideration than someone such as me, who comes to the question on a reflex reaction of full separation.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.0/4">I recognise that the ring fence is the only show in town, but it must be reliable and meaningful. The Government&#8217;s proposed procedure in amendment 6 could take longer than the life of a Parliament to have an effect. There will be not just the preliminary decisions but the Treasury consents required for those decisions, and tribunals after the warnings and the decisions, then variations and consultation between the regulators&#8212;the whole thing will go on.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.0/5">If we are legislating about something we have reason to fear might arise in the life of the next Parliament, is it credible that we expect those who sit in that Parliament</p>
	<p pid="c.87.0/6">to say, &#8220;Thank God for the legislation the previous Parliament passed. They equipped us to deal with this situation. They learned the lessons of LIBOR and everything else and made sure the regulator had powers to deal with egregious breaches and circumstances that nobody would have thought of when they were legislating&#8221;? We cannot legislate for every contingency, but we have learned from LIBOR and so on that we must legislate for all sorts of inconceivable excesses that might arise, as well as for things that might be felt to be excesses in the eyes of this House and of a wise Committee such as the Treasury Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.0/7">We should not deny regulators the back-up equipment that would be needed in such a situation. As a Member from Northern Ireland, I will not get into &#8220;guns in the locker&#8221; and so on, as other hon. Members have. I will talk about tools in the toolkit and equipment at base that might be needed in an extreme situation, and clearly the regulators need such equipment.</p>
	<p pid="c.87.0/8">We as a Parliament also need to learn the lessons of the past. We made false assumptions that things were going swimmingly in the City and everything was okay, which is why the Opposition&#8217;s proposals for a periodic review are so important. People do not trust Parliament to be alert enough, which is why we need to legislate for ourselves and for the regulators&#8212;and, most importantly, to regulate for the public interest.</p>

	<p pid="c.88.0/1">I, too, pay tribute to the members of the parliamentary commission, with whom I served for 10 months. Huge numbers of people were involved as well as huge amounts of effort. One statistic that has not come out yet is that we apparently asked 9,198 questions of our witnesses, so we certainly got stuck into it in a big way. It was truly a tour de force, as Members can see from the 571-page document I have in my hand.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.0/2">The Commission was an incredibly important piece of work. We have been trying to deal with the fundamental loss of trust in banking and what pleased me enormously was that one of the passages quoted relatively early in the report, on page 83, was from one of our big banks, Lloyds Banking Group, and was about trust. Let me read it out:</p>
	<p pid="c.88.0/3">&#8220;Trust goes to the heart of what banking is about. Customers need to be able to trust their bank to look after their savings. They need to trust their bank to manage their financial transactions smoothly; trust that their bank will be diligent and not provide levels of credit or mortgage that are more than the customer can re-pay; and trust their bank to provide products that genuinely meet the customer&#8217;s needs and which the customer can understand.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.88.0/4">That has been crucial to the problem we have had: of course we considered LIBOR and all the various scandals, but at the end of the day there is a fundamental mistrust between the consumer, who is not very well educated, and the banks, which are well educated. In part, we are seeking to resolve that misbalance of trust.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.0/5">I urge the Minister not to be shy in legislating to help build that trust. As TheCityUK wrote, again cited on page 83:</p>
	<p pid="c.88.0/6">&#8220;The sustainability of the UK&#8217;s position as the pre-eminent global financial services centre is grounded in the integrity of its financial markets and probity of market participants.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.88.0/7">That is key to the debate about ring-fencing, criminal sanctions and the various other important measures available to the Government in the arms race in which we are involved&#8212;ranging from the gun locker of the</p>
	<p pid="c.88.0/8">hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso) to my offshore nuclear deterrent&#8212;to ensure that the people who run the banks pay attention and take seriously their role in looking after those institutions. I speak as someone who spent 17 years as an investment banker and 10 years as a hedge fund manager. As I have now gone into politics, I have the hat trick of holding the three most unpopular jobs on the planet&#8212;I plan to become a traffic warden when I leave this place.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.0/9">We hear threats from the banking community that if we over-regulate, that community will get up and go, but there are two incredibly important points to consider, the first of which is: where would the banks go? They do not have a big range of options. A bank that wanted to go to the far east, for example, would face several problems, not least of which is the fact that were HSBC to up sticks and go to Singapore&#8212;this would apply to the remainder of the major four banks&#8212;its balance sheet would be about 1,100% of the country&#8217;s gross domestic product, and no regulator would enthusiastically receive a bank of such a size. Secondly, we should remember that several factors in this country are incredibly important to banks, such as our robust, transparent and tried-and-tested legal system. We are a member of the single market, which gives banks access to the whole of Europe; we speak English, which is the language of the international business and banking community; and we are also at the centre of the time zones.</p>
	<p pid="c.88.0/10">Our regulatory regime is also absolutely crucial. A great deal of our work was to try to get rid of the implicit guarantee whereby the Government are seen as standing behind the banks in case they fall over. That guarantee can be worth anything up to &#163;40 billion a year, depending on the stage of the cycle, and that gives the big four banks an advantage. The problem is that that anti-competitive advantage represents another barrier to entry for challenger banks, so we need to get rid of the implicit guarantee. However, by regulating firmly, well and efficiently, and by winning the race to the top on regulation, we will replace the implicit guarantee with a cheaper funding rate for the UK banks, because they will see large amounts of international capital coming to the UK to take advantage of the protection that our regulatory and legal regimes provide. I therefore urge the Minister not to be shy about coming forward and to consider carefully the amendments proposed by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>, which reflect the recommendations of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and have a great deal of merit.</p>

	<p pid="c.89.0/1">We have had a fascinating, high-quality debate. I am grateful for the contributions of all hon. Members, but especially for those of the Members who served with such distinction on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards: my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40678" name="Mark Garnier">the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier)</phrase>; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40669" name="Pat McFadden">the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden)</phrase>; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr Love)</phrase>, who is no longer in the Chamber; the Chair of the commission, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40166" name="Andrew Tyrie">the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)</phrase>; and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40138" name="John Thurso">the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross (John Thurso)</phrase>. With the help of Members of the other place, they laboured hard to produce a report that not only will stand the test of time, but will be a reference document for many generations in this</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/2">country and throughout the world. The report will be seen as a major contribution to addressing the less tangible aspects of culture and standards, which is something that has eluded regulators throughout the world. I am sure that the report will be read with a great deal of interest.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/3">The report&#8217;s central judgment includes the acute point that for too long questions of standards and culture have been contracted out to regulators, rather than being an intrinsic part of the institutions themselves. That aspect of the report stood out as the essence of the required change, because it should no longer be simply for the regulators to decide on such questions, as the culture throughout the institutions should reflect the correct standards that we expect.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/4">I spoke at length at the beginning of the debate, so I shall deal briefly with several of the points that hon. Members raised. I was asked about timetabling. On Second Reading, I made two commitments, the first of which was that the House would have adequate time to consider all provisions, including amendments proposed by the parliamentary commission. I hope that hon. Members will concede that I have been true to that in Committee and throughout our two days on Report, and I repeat that that commitment remains as the Bill goes to the other place. I also said explicitly on Second Reading that the recommendations of the commission&#8217;s final report on standards and culture would be reflected in amendments to be made in the House of Lords. Of course, those measures will subsequently be considered by this House, so our intention has not changed. It was right to expedite the response to the report so that it available much more quickly than usual. It has been useful in informing today&#8217;s discussions, as will be the case tomorrow, and it will be available to their lordships during their consideration of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/5"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">The hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> asked several specific questions, including about whether Government amendment 8 contained a typo. It does not, but it would require more than the four minutes remaining for me to explain why, so I hope that he will trust me on that at least. The upper tribunal is not a new invention; it is the court that considers all references made under FSMA for adjudication.</p>
	<p pid="c.89.0/6">The hon. Gentleman made a substantive point about the notice period, as did my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester and the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East. I was asked whether an elongated process in some way diminishes the effectiveness of the ring fence. Our intention was&#8212;and is&#8212;to implement faithfully the parliamentary commission&#8217;s recommendation on the institution-specific ring-fencing rule. As I assured my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester, I am confident that if the Government&#8217;s proposals can be improved during the Bill&#8217;s passage, all his concerns about the use of the power can be addressed. In fact, the procedure under consideration has been described as pressing the nuclear button.</p>

	<p pid="c.90.0/1">I think that was a concession, so I am extremely grateful to the Minister. I am also grateful that the response was published at the earliest opportunity&#8212;it could have been delayed, so at least we have had a chance to look at it. That shows us that the Government are listening, and the response will be helpful in the other place. Above all, it gives us more</p>

	<p pid="c.91.2/1">I have one minute left, so the right hon. Gentleman will understand that I cannot give way. The proposal that there be five years to implement the action has been discussed with the regulators; it reflects best regulatory practice. In point of fact, if there were no time limit in the Bill, which is what one of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend would ensure, that would render the use of the power without limit, so I think we are in the same territory&#8212;the right territory&#8212;in wanting to specify that there should be a limit. It should be clearly understood that there is a limit to the use of the electrification powers, in terms of a timetable, and a deadline for action.

	<p pid="c.102.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the clause be read a Second time.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">It is a delight to see the Leader of the House on the Front Bench to debate with me the question of the leverage ratio&#8212;I favour the pronunciation, &#8220;leaverage&#8221;&#8212;and I am happy to give way to him if he has any concerns about it. As the Leader of the House&#8212;<i>[</i><i>Interruption</i><i>]</i><i>&#8212;</i>and, indeed, the Minister will know, a bank&#8217;s leverage is the ratio of its assets to equity capital. Its equity capital is equal to the value of its assets, minus the value of its liabilities. Higher leverage rates magnify returns, because any growth in assets will be proportionately greater if equity is thin, but&#8212;and this is why it matters&#8212;the corollary is that any losses are magnified if leverage is greater. Its equity can be wiped out by a smaller shock than would wipe out the equity of a less leveraged institution.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.2/3">The Government said that they intended to provide the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England with a time-varying leverage ratio tool, but not before 2018, and that that would be subject to a review in 2017 to assess progress internationally. The design of the tool would depend, hon. Members will be glad to hear, on European Union legislation, and will be set out in Britain in due course in secondary legislation. I know that they are keen on that particular process.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.2/4">The Independent Commission on Banking was clear on this matter, and said that it supported the use of leveraged ratios as a back-stop. It called for a tapering of the requirements when a bank crossed a certain size</p>
	<p pid="c.102.2/5">threshold by increasing the minimum leverage ratio from 3%&#8212;the Basel proposal&#8212;to over 4% on a sliding scale, as the risk weighting of assets to GDP ratio increased from 1% to 3%. The Opposition believe, as do many commentators&#8212;this is a question that came up in the recommendations from the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards&#8212;that reforms are needed to leverage, as well as the risk weighting of assets. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, regulators introduced the risk weighting of assets process as an antidote to the high-risk, high-reward culture pervasive in banks. That process, however, has been partial, somewhat self-defined by the banks themselves in some cases, and in the European Union, the zero risk weighting attributed to some palpably risky sovereign debts has brought that system into disrepute.</p>
	<p pid="c.102.2/6">Leverage ratio powers need to be taken in the Bill, and phased in before the EU plans for the end of the decade. That was one of the main conclusions of the Vickers report. Not legislating for leverage restraint is a significant omission from a Bill that the Chancellor claimed would reset the banking system.</p>

	<p pid="c.103.0/1">I am very supportive of the notion of legislating now for the leverage provision, but in his new clause, the hon. Gentleman discusses</p>
	<p pid="c.103.0/2">&#8220;a target for the overall leverage of the&#8230;system, to encompass&#8230;the activities of foreign financial institutions and non-bank originators of credit&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.103.0/3">&#8212;or shadow banking. Although that might be taken into consideration in the calculation, the FPC would have no power to implement a leverage ratio in the shadow banking sector, so is there not an unintended consequence that leverage ratios may be too high in the formal banking sector to compensate for what the report found?</p>

	<p pid="c.103.1/1">I am delighted that the hon. Gentleman has taken the trouble to look at the new clause, because it is our second attempt to cajole or persuade the Government to look at this issue. In Committee, we took a different approach to the question of leverage, and tried to clarify that there was a clear power for the Government to act. I hope in the spirit of consensus and trying to move the arguments forward, the Minister and the House will accept that we have taken a new approach, thinking about leverage as it affects the UK economy as a whole. Leverage&#8212;and I shall come on to make this argument&#8212;is part and parcel of the way in which an economy works, and in the new clause we have looked at a particular design that would encompass other institutions. I do not want to be misinterpreted: we mention foreign banks, for example, but I do no intend any extra-territorial reference in the new clause. It simply makes it clear that the provision has to encompass effective leverage on the UK financial services sector as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="c.103.1/2">I have referred to the Vickers commission, and it is important that we do not forget the work that it did, and that we pay tribute to it. It said that</p>
	<p pid="c.103.1/3">&#8220;a leverage cap of thirty-three is too lax for systemically important banks, since it means that a loss of only 3% of such banks&#8217; assets would wipe out their capital.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.103.1/4">The commission recommended a 25:1 ratio&#8212;a 4% ratio&#8212;but the Chancellor dismissed that concern. It is essential that the ring fence is supported by tougher capital requirements, as well as by a leverage ratio.</p>
	<p pid="c.103.1/5">The parliamentary commission said that it was not convinced by the Government&#8217;s decision to reject the Vickers recommendation to limit leverage in this way. The parliamentary commission said that it</p>
	<p pid="c.103.1/6">&#8220;considers it essential that the ring-fence should be supported by a higher leverage ratio, and would expect the leverage ratio to be set substantially higher than the 3 per cent minimum required under Basel III.Not to do so would reduce the effectiveness of the leverage ratio as a counter-weight to the weaknesses of risk weighting<i>.</i>&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.103.1/7">Sir Mervyn King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, said that the leverage ratio turned out to be</p>
	<p pid="c.103.1/8">&#8220;a far better predictor of the institutions that failed in the crisis&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.103.1/9">than measures of risk-weighted assets. I could go on; a great deal of debate has taken place on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.103.1/10">Our new clause seeks a way of ensuring clarity on the powers and what sort of process would take place. We suggest that the powers of the Financial Policy Committee in the Financial Services Act 2012 should be amended to make it clear that a target should be set by the Treasury for the overall leverage of the United Kingdom&#8217;s financial system to encompass all the activities of those institutions that are originators of credit.</p>

	<p pid="c.104.0/1">May I unpick what the hon. Gentleman is saying? Does he mean a minimum leverage ratio or a target? There is a difference. Perhaps he could clarify that.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-07-08c.104.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" speakername="Christopher Leslie" colnum="104"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#130708-0003.htm_spnew19">
	<p pid="c.104.1/1">That is a very good question and I am open to debate on that. I believe that looking at that minimum leverage ratio as a target to be set for the leverage of the system as a whole in the UK would be the point of public policy, which is why it needs to be dealt with in a policy-making context by the Treasury, with reference to Parliament if need be. The key point is that it should then be for the regulators to look at the detailed implementation of that on a firm-by-firm basis.</p>
	<p pid="c.104.1/2">Essentially, there is a parallel to be drawn between the way that the Chancellor of the Exchequer sets an inflation target for the Bank of England and the Monetary Policy Committee is given operational independence to find ways of meeting that target. The purpose of the debate today is to look at the potential parallel to be drawn there, with a target being set and operational independence for the implementation of that target being given to the Financial Policy Committee and the Bank of England. Over every three-month period the FPC should respond by notifying any changes and any actions that it has taken in order to regulate leverage, so that there is a dialogue and a process that is fairly self-explanatory.</p>

	<p pid="c.104.2/1">The hon. Gentleman is being very generous in giving way, but I want to be clear about his proposition. A target would imply that a bank that was just 10 times leverage would have to raise its leverage ratio to 25 times if it was a 4% target, whereas if it was a 4% minimum leverage ratio, that would be totally different. The bank that leveraged 10 times would not be in breach of that.</p>

	<p pid="c.104.3/1">I understand the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s point. Let me be clear. The target that should be set would be for the financial system as a whole. It would be for the regulators to make judgments about firm-by-firm leverage arrangements, so it would be on a more sophisticated</p>
	<p pid="c.104.3/2">basis. There is a case to be made for a regulator to look at each individual institution. Some institutions are significantly different from one another. Some of the building societies, for example, have recently been making the point that they have different asset structures and so on, and that exactly the same leverage arrangement across the board for all firms simultaneously would not necessarily be appropriate. In an effort to work towards some way of dealing with the issue, this design is one that I have suggested.</p>

	<p pid="c.105.0/1">In the proposal, the hon. Gentleman suggests that the committee has to take into account</p>
	<p pid="c.105.0/2">&#8220;adequate credit availability and growth in the economy&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.105.0/3">and report to the Treasury. Would the Chancellor and the Treasury have any right of veto or influence over that, or would they have to put up with the Bank&#8217;s judgment of what is adequate credit growth? That could be rather important if the problem were one of insufficient growth in the economy.</p>

	<p pid="c.105.1/1">That raises the question of the operation of the inflation target. If I draw a parallel between a leverage target and an inflation target, clearly the Chancellor has been setting out his inflation target. It has been missed on a number of occasions&#8212;quite a few months and quarters have gone by&#8212;so the interplay between the Chancellor and the Bank of England is critical here. I am more than happy to come back to the issue. My point in the new clause today is that we need to start seriously discussing how, from a UK perspective, we are going to deal with the issue of leverage from a home-grown point of view, rather than waiting for the European Union to come along with a set of arrangements which may or may not fit our circumstances.</p>

	<p pid="c.105.2/1">There are two points that occur on the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s target weighting. One is that it is very arbitrary. If the regulator could set it for each individual bank, that would give a very strong arbitrary power to the bank to meet that overall target. The second is that although people say that their assets are particularly good ones and better than others, that is exactly what they said in the crisis and it turned out not to be reliable.</p>

	<p pid="c.105.3/1">I agree with the hon. Gentleman, but it would be invidious for us as politicians to try to delve into the specific analysis of bank-by-bank asset or liability, quality and the risk weighting of assets. That is why we have regulators and what their job should be, but it is important that as a body politic, so to speak, we make a judgment about the level of leverage that we should have in the economy as a whole. That is why I raise the issue today.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.3/2">For us, tackling the leverage question is incredibly important. We should not wait for the European Union to decide these things for us. We sought in Committee to clarify this in part. Rather than put it in the &#8220;too difficult to handle&#8221; box, as the Government seem to be doing, we should try to move forward constructively. The approach that we have taken is on the amendment paper. First, it is necessary to prevent the banks from over-extending themselves beyond the point of safety.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.3/3">Ring-fencing does not do that. We think ring-fencing changes should go alongside capital requirements and leverage regulation.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.3/4">Secondly, we have been hearing arguments recently about the leverage ratio as anathema to bank lending into the real economy. Sometimes it is characterised as one or the other. I do not necessarily agree that there is a seesaw trade-off between the two. Andrew Bailey at the Prudential Regulation Authority has recently made the particularly pertinent argument that capital can be lent onwards in any case, so it should not be a case of one or the other.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.3/5">For the sake of clarity, in new clause 9 we looked to address this explicitly by framing a leverage target strategy for the system as a whole, which must be constructed in such a manner so as to maintain adequate credit availability to support a growing economy. It is important to recognise that we will always operate with a degree of leverage. That is part and parcel of the way our banking system works, and our constituents rightly want us to focus on getting the economy moving, while preventing excessive risk-taking. In the spirit of constructive engagement, we hope the amendment strikes the right balance.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.3/6">It is sometimes argued that leverage should be a back-stop rather than a front stop. The argument about what is a back-stop and what is a front-stop can get rather theological. Andy Haldane makes the point in his famous &#8220;The Dog and the Frisbee&#8221; speech that leverage needs to be brought much further forward as a primary tool for the regulators, and that other capital and risk-weighting issues should be subordinated. The main point is that leverage should be recognised as a key dynamic in our economy and needs to be regulated in a way not dissimilar to the regulation of inflation.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.3/7">For us, there are three essential elements: set a leverage target for the system as a whole, which is a task for the Government; measure that risk&#8212;the threats to whether loans are going to be repaid&#8212;more accurately by sector, to determine which sector needs more capital to make it safe if leverage is rising and which could dealt with in a normal way; stress-test to back-test the pressures in those particular institutions to be clear that the choice of the leverage target is correct. The regulator should do that.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.3/8">New clause 9 would also augment Bank of England independence in relation to operational decisions on monetary policy and take into account the need to supply credit to the wider economy. I am glad that the Building Societies Association and others support it.</p>
	<p pid="c.105.3/9">I know that other Members wish to speak and so will not take much more time. It is not good enough for the Government simply to leave this out of the Bill completely, to leave the regulators slightly powerless on this point and to leave the EU to deal with it. There are ways of overcoming the impact that leverage questions might have on non-plc institutions, such as those building societies, and having the regulator make those operational judgments is one of them, but we must have the safeguard in place. We must also eradicate once and for all the concept of a bank being &#8220;too big to fail.&#8221; I think that action on leverage would certainly be one way of doing that.</p>

	<p pid="c.107.0/1">I remind the House that I provide investment advice on world markets and world economies, but I am pleased to say that it has nothing to do with banking credit or banking leverage, so I feel quite entitled to comment in this important debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.107.0/2">I welcome what I hope is a probing new clause from the Opposition. It allows us to discuss something that is at the heart of what regulators need to do to have a strong banking sector and economy and to have the comfort at night of knowing that we will not live through another dreadful crisis like the credit crunch of the previous decade. The new clause goes to the heart of the issue: what action should the Government and regulators take to try to ensure that large banks and other institutions advancing credit that can be a risk to the whole system are kept under sensible control, so that we can be pretty confident that, if something goes wrong or the world economy dips, they have the necessary money to pay the bills and deal with any losses that might arise?</p>
	<p pid="c.107.0/3">If we look at the tragic history of the previous decade, we can see that the then banking regulator in the United Kingdom&#8212;I think that it has now admitted this&#8212;got it wrong both ways. It wanted the banks to have too little capital, cash and protection, and in the run-up to the credit crisis in 2008 it allowed the most enormous expansion of leverage, which previous generations of regulators had not permitted. Then, in the ensuing panic, when interest rates had to rise to tackle the problem of inflation, it lurched to wanting very high amounts of capital, but at the time the banks could not generate profit and so found that very difficult. That resulted in the previous Government&#8217;s decision, in two of the worst cases, that capital should be forthcoming from the state and taxpayers themselves. I think that we all agree that we do not want to go back around that course or to get to the position again where some Members of this House feel that the only option is for the state to provide taxpayer support for organisations that have been too leveraged.</p>
	<p pid="c.107.0/4">New clause 9 suggests that it is possible to set a leverage ratio for the system as a whole, and it might be, and that might be desirable, and I look forward to the Minister&#8217;s response. Of course, the regulator already does that in a way because it sets individual target ratios or capital requirements for all the major banks in the system, so if we aggregate those we get to its view of the aggregate amount of leverage. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> has rightly said, if that overall leverage were to be set for the system as a whole, the regulator would still need to interpret that bank by bank. Some banks would be super-prudent and some would be straining at the other end of the spectrum and might be under special measures with the regulator to try to get their balance sheets into shape.</p>
	<p pid="c.107.0/5">My particular worry at the moment is that it is never easy managing the transition. We would all be delighted to wake up tomorrow and discover that all the banks are super-safe, but if the price of getting to that stage too quickly is no growth in the economy or, worse still, the onset of another recession because the banks cannot finance the recovery, that would be a bad idea. Many of us would like to see the banks get to better ratios by writing more profitable business and generating more legitimate and sensible levels of profit, rather than having the regulator run the risk of moving too quickly</p>
	<p pid="c.107.0/6">to demand that they have much better ratios. The banks would then have to achieve those better ratios by not writing any new business and by trying to get old loans back ever more quickly from businesses that might find it difficult to repay them. Some of those banks, not being very profitable, could not trade themselves out of the difficulties that they found themselves in.</p>
	<p pid="c.107.0/7">We also need to be conscious of what is happening globally, because although we should not chase the rest of the world if it has a group of regulators that are being far too generous and wish to re-enact the boom-type crisis of the previous decade&#8212;I do not think that we are in that position any more; I think that the regulators of the world are all generally trying to be more cautious&#8212;we need to ensure that we do not do anything in Britain that is particularly penal. What we need in order to have a prosperous economy is banks with sufficient profit, reserves and capital to be able to finance a normal recovery. It is very unpopular in this country to speak up for banks making profits at the moment, or indeed at any time, but it is important that they generate reasonable working profits, because that is the best way to make them more solvent.</p>

	<p pid="c.108.0/1">Is my right hon. Friend as unconvinced as I am by the relatively arbitrary figure of 4% being preferable to 3% for the leverage ratio?

Although he might secretly want 4%, like the rest of us he is probably wise enough to know that, although it might be nice to have 4% in due course, to lurch straight to a target that some big banks could not meet might be very damaging to the economy.</p>

	<p pid="c.108.2/1">One of the problems at the moment, as I know from my constituency, is that some companies are still finding it difficult to get money from banks, so the higher the leverage requirement, the more the banks will say that they have to keep the capital and cannot lend it. I agree with my right hon. Friend entirely that we have to be very careful about how we move from 3% to 4%, because otherwise it is companies and growth that will suffer.</p>

	<p pid="c.109.0/1">I think that a Government have to take responsibility for the big calls on economic policy. They can take very good advice from independent regulators and the Bank of England, and sensible Chancellors take good advice, but ultimately it is the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Prime Minister of the day who have their names on all that, and the electorate will expect them to be responsible. I think that people believe in independent central banks and independent regulators up to the point where they get it wrong, and then they look to politicians to take the blame. We have just been through a period when the banking regulator, by its own admission, got it very visibly wrong.</p>

	<p pid="c.109.1/1">The Government are suggesting that the regulators will get it wrong in 2018, and the commissions say that they will get it wrong a little sooner. Is this not an argument about timing and when the economy will be out of its current difficulties?</p>

	<p pid="c.109.2/2">Time is not generous, so I will be brief. My worry is that, under the previous Labour Government and in the early days of the coalition, we were running a strange policy in which, on the one hand, the Bank of England was trying to depress the vehicle&#8217;s accelerator by creating a lot of extra money and saying, &#8220;We really need to get some of this money out there to do some good in the economy.&#8221; On the other hand, the banking regulator was depressing the vehicle&#8217;s brake, saying, &#8220;No, you can&#8217;t possibly spend that money to create more credit and do more things. The priority is for the banks to sit on the money to have better cash and capital ratios. They probably need to wind down their loan books, which we think are too big.&#8221; My observation is that if we try to drive a vehicle with one foot on the accelerator and one on the brake, the brake normally wins.</p>

	<p pid="c.109.3/1">As has been mentioned already, some in the Bank, including Sir Mervyn King, argued that insufficient lending is a consequence of insufficient capital. I put that to Mr Bailey a few days ago in the Treasury Committee. I asked him about the net new lending level now compared with when funding for lending began last August, and he said that it was flat. Is that not evidence for his proposition that we cannot have tighter adequacy requirements on capital and lots more new lending? The figures show that lending is flat.</p>

	<p pid="c.109.4/1">Indeed. That point also shows that we need banks to be profitable&#8212;particularly RBS, which is still largely state owned. Until the bank is making profits, its capital ratios will not improve quickly enough and it will then not be in a position to lend the money that the Government would like it to. The taxpayer</p>
	<p pid="c.109.4/2">would be grateful if it could be more profitable, because our shares would be worth more, which would be in the general interest.</p>
	<p pid="c.109.4/3">I conclude by making the same point to the Minister. Yes, I want us to get to stronger banks with tighter ratios, but I want us to get there through growth and growth in bank profits&#8212;particularly for HBOS and RBS, in which we have a large state stake and whose results have been disappointing for a number of years. If we can get to that happy position, we can have a bit of growth and some more profitability and then the regulator will have to have a sensible conversation with the banks; it will say that some of the money has to be put into cash and capital so that they are stronger. We will be the better for that.</p>

	<p pid="c.110.0/1">I will not detain the Chamber for long; I just want to make a few points.</p>
	<p pid="c.110.0/2">The argument is really about complexity versus simplicity in how banks are regulated. One of the points that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> is trying to bring out is the inadequacy of the over-complex Basel regulations, which have allowed banks to game the system and say they had hugely different capital ratios on similar classes of assets in different institutions. The truth is that the Basel system is so complex that it does not give confidence about the safety of our banks. That is why this debate about leverage is so important.</p>
	<p pid="c.110.0/3">In all the debate about ring-fencing, separation and so on, what has perhaps been under-discussed is the fact that not enough attention has been paid to leverage&#8212;a basic measure of banks&#8217; safety or resilience against future risks and very important in respect of banks&#8217; ability to absorb losses. One of the features consistently pointed out, both to the Treasury Committee and the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, was that in the run-up to the crisis banks were hugely over-leveraged. That meant that their capacity to absorb and deal with problems when they came was minimal.</p>
	<p pid="c.110.0/4">Our banks still have very high gearing today. The banks lobby hard on the issue. I counsel caution on the basic trade-off that has been raised about lending and leverage. There are other ways for banks to improve their capital ratios than simply by reducing lending. They could, for example, look at the proportion that they give out in remuneration every year; that could make a difference to their capital ratios. Over the past decade or two, vast amounts of money have been paid out in remuneration that could have improved capital ratios without having any effect at all on lending. Let us not fall for the argument that we can either have banks that lend, or safe banks, but we cannot have both. It would be wrong of us to fall into that false dichotomy. We should aim for banks that are both safe and have the ability to lend.</p>
	<p pid="c.110.0/5">There is also the international dimension. Part of the rationale for the Government&#8217;s current position on the 3% leverage ratio&#8212;or a leverage ratio of 33:1, if we want to put it that way&#8212;is that it is part of the new Basel regime. However, we have a particular issue in the UK. We are a global&#8212;some would say the main global&#8212;financial centre, but in a medium-sized economy. That gives us many great strengths, to which the hon. Member</p>
	<p pid="c.110.0/6">for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier) alluded in the earlier debate. There are the associated services of law, consultancy and the rest of it. That is true. Those provide good employment and tax revenue and make Britain an attractive place to do business. However, we must not be so blinded by that that we do not take the necessary measures to insulate the rest of our economy from the risks.</p>
	<p pid="c.110.0/7">We know that those risks are real, because we are still living with the consequences of them following the crisis. The leverage ratio is absolutely at the heart of that, so there is an important British reason why we should think twice about simply going along with minimum international requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.110.0/8">It is incumbent on us as policy makers in this House, and on regulators who have responsibility for the issue, to look at Britain&#8217;s specific circumstances as a global financial centre with a medium-sized economy, so that we keep the strengths that that entails without the rest of the economy, taxpayers or the Government being held to ransom.</p>

	<p pid="c.111.0/1">It is a pleasure to respond to this important debate. First, I should like to correct a grievous omission in my previous remarks. During my paean of praise to the members of the parliamentary commission, I neglected to include my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40678" name="Mark Garnier">the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier)</phrase>, who was behind me and therefore was invisible to me. He has been in the Chamber throughout this debate and his contribution is no less sterling and distinguished than those of the other parliamentary commission members whom I did mention. I apologise.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/2">The new clause requires the Treasury to set a leverage target for the</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/3">&#8220;overall leverage of the&#8230;financial system&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/4">I welcome what I think is the spirit of the new clause. Problems with risk weights clearly contributed to the financial crisis; <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40669" name="Pat McFadden">the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden)</phrase> made that point. Those problems must be addressed if risk weights are to have a place in the regulatory regime of the future.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/5">I also share the concerns raised by the parliamentary commission about the importance of having a robust minimum leverage ratio required by the regulator. As my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> said, there is clearly support among Members on both sides of the House for that notion. We have consistently argued for a binding minimum leverage ratio to be implemented internationally, to supplement the risk-weighting requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/6">As has been said, the Basel III standard of 3% will come into force in 2018, following an observation period beforehand and a final calibration of the leverage ratio in 2017. Of course, national supervisors must be equipped to respond to new risks as they emerge in banks and financial markets. The PRA, in this country, is empowered to ensure that banks&#8217; risk models are appropriately conservative and, where necessary, to set higher capital requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/7">As every hon. Member will be aware, the PRA has recently announced that major UK banks need to set out and implement plans to improve their leverage ratios and so to migrate further towards the new Basel III standard even now. The FPC has already been given a number of directive powers, including a counter-cyclical</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/8">capital buffer and the power to set time-varying sectoral capital requirements. The Government have also made clear their intention to give the FPC the power to vary through time the baseline leverage ratio requirement, always subject to its never being below the requirement determined by Basel III.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/9">Let me address the new clause, in whose support <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase> spoke. The first thing to say is that it requires the Treasury to give the Bank of England a target for the overall leverage of the UK&#8217;s financial system; I think I understand the hon. Gentleman correctly when I see an allusion to the inflation target perhaps given to the Bank of England. I have to say, though, that that pulls in the opposite direction to the parliamentary commission&#8217;s recommendation, which calls for the FPC&#8212;in other words, the Bank of England&#8212;to be given the power to determine leverage ratios. In its first and final reports, it noted that</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/10">&#8220;the leverage ratio is a complex and technical decision best made by the regulator and it certainly should not be made by politicians.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/11">The new clause cuts across the views of the parliamentary commission, if delivering that recommendation were its intention.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/12">Moreover, the new clause would require a target for the overall leverage of the UK&#8217;s financial system. Again, this is not quite the right approach. Banks should certainly be subject to individual leverage requirements to ensure that they have sufficient capital to absorb losses, but an average leverage ratio for the entire financial sector could serve to conceal the risks in particular institutions. It would seem perverse to require the Treasury to set a target for overall leverage and so create an onus on the FPC to allow some banks to remain highly leveraged as long as this is offset by smaller or more conservative institutions running with less leverage. A system-wide average, or net, leverage ratio might be of little value in tackling excesses of leverage, and it could be positively counter-productive.</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/13">Another feature of the new clause would be dangerous. The proposal for a target requires the FPC to pursue action to meet the target. It is suggested that the FPC take action to increase leverage in the system when it is less than the target level that the Government are required to set. I am not clear how or why the FPC would want to do that. The target approach seems to me to be wrong. Financial stability is not like price stability; it cannot be boiled down to a single, symmetrical target. As a recent Bank of England paper concluded:</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/14">&#8220;No single set of indicators can ever provide a perfect guide to systemic risks, or to the appropriate policy responses&#8230;Judgement will, therefore, play a material role in all FPC decisions and policy will not be mechanically tied to any specific set of indicators.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/15">We need to apply caution in any consideration of enshrining in law a system that focuses on one target for systematic financial stability. Goodhart&#8217;s law is relevant in these circumstances:</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/16">&#8220;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.111.0/17">I therefore hope that on reflection the hon. Gentleman will withdraw his new clause.</p>

	<p pid="c.112.0/1">I am grateful for the quality of the debate that has taken place in the short time we have had.</p>
	<p pid="c.112.0/2">I am glad that we tabled this new clause on leverage, because otherwise we would not have had the opportunity to start to focus on the issue. I understand what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> said about getting the balance right and the care and caution that is needed as we move towards what we want, which is a better, safer level of leverage within the overall system. It is worth reiterating that we want to do this only to make sure that banks do not over-extend themselves and become so lopsided that when they topple over they are not able to absorb the losses should things take a turn for the worse.</p>
	<p pid="c.112.0/3">I am particularly grateful for the contribution by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40669" name="Pat McFadden">the Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden)</phrase>, who rightly pointed out that saying that we need action either on leverage or on getting lending going into the real economy does not represent alternative poles of the argument. It is not as clear as that. Some are arguing not only that the extra capital could be lent out but, as he said, that compensation ratios, as they are sometimes known&#8212;the remuneration levels within banks&#8212;could also be tackled. Given that we are the major financial centre worldwide, we should not just be leaving this to international regulators. We certainly should not be leaving it to the European Union completely to decide these things for us. We have a duty in the UK to make sure that we think these things through properly and spend much more time on them.</p>

	<p pid="c.113.0/1">The hon. Gentleman proposes that the individual leverage ratios of the banks be published, but if that information were in the public domain it could have implications for a bank&#8217;s funding costs. If the regulator deems that a particular institution has a greater risk, and therefore looks at a lower leverage, that will clearly have implications for the business.</p>

	<p pid="c.113.1/1">I would tend to err on the side of publication and transparency. It is long overdue that we have better insight into banks&#8217; balance sheets and the quality of their assets generally.</p>
	<p pid="c.113.1/2">If we are to have this architecture, it could be a useful dynamic to have a leverage target set by policy makers&#8212;by Government. I slightly take issue with the parliamentary commission on this. There is a systemic aspect that ought to rest in the hands of politicians. Ultimately, the buck stops with us and Parliament is sovereign; the arguments about that are well known. However, as the commission said, the operational decisions taken institution by institution have to be left to the regulator. It would be invidious for that to be in the hands of the Treasury.</p>

	<p pid="c.113.2/1">RBS, against the wishes of some of us, had been allowed to grow to a colossal size and to gear excessively. At the point when it got into trouble, it had a balance sheet of &#163;2.2 trillion &#8212;almost four times the tax revenue of the state&#8212;and if it lost 2% of its asset value it lost the equivalent of the defence budget for a whole year.

I am disappointed by the Minister&#8217;s attitude of saying, &#8220;We&#8217;ll just leave this and do it internationally. We&#8217;ll come to it in 2018 through the normal conveyor belt on when these things happen.&#8221; The Government must address this issue far more constructively and engage with it far more seriously, because it really does matter. We need action on leverage and it is important that we put on record the essential characteristics that it could and should have within our economy as a whole.

	<p pid="c.119.0/1">In speaking to new clause 2, which I will not press to a vote, I wish to follow the line of argument pursued by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> on new clause 9. He drew attention to the tension created by building up capital while also lending more and used the analogy of driving with one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake. If I may, I will take a step outside the car. With new clause 2, I wish to draw the House&#8217;s attention to a similar, I am sure unintended tension. The Government are taking a positive step forward, because in paragraphs 2.13 and 2.14 of their response to the parliamentary commission&#8217;s report, they make the welcome announcement that they accept the premise of reversing the burden of proof. In doing so, however, they will adopt a measure suggested in paragraphs 1170 and 1171 of the commission&#8217;s report that will create a potential handicap. A new condition will be attached to using that burden of proof, whereby the regulator must have concluded a successful enforcement action against the firm prior to doing so.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/2">I do not think there can be any doubt about the merits of reversing the burden of proof. It is clear that if the regulator is required to sift through reams of e-mails looking for evidence to incriminate a senior banker, it will be a time-consuming and costly exercise. It is also highly likely that it will fail, because senior executives are not so stupid as to write boastful and wilful e-mails such as we saw from some of the LIBOR traders, who bragged of having their bottles of Bolly. Most senior executives are wise to the risks of e-mails and would not fall into such a trap. It is proportionate and reasonable to argue that senior executives who say that their hands-on leadership is sufficient to justify very high individual bonuses should also, on the other side of the coin, be able to demonstrate that they have personally acted reasonably.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/3">The Government&#8217;s announcement that they will reverse the burden of proof is extremely welcome. However, the acceptance of paragraph 1171 of the Commission&#8217;s report could lead to a real impediment. If we open the door to personal enforcement, why would a chief executive wish to settle on behalf of their firm? We are trying to make it easier for the regulator to focus in a time-efficient and cost-effective manner on the individuals who should be held responsible, but that will be impeded by the additional requirement for enforcement to be concluded against the firm. The senior leadership whom we want to target will be incentivised to drag out proceedings and impede any settlement with the firm. I do not believe that is the Government&#8217;s intention, but I wished</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/4">to draw the Minister&#8217;s attention to it so that the issue could be discussed in more detail and tackled in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/5">I do not share the confidence of some colleagues who have spoken about the ability of criminal sanctions to operate effectively. They are a welcome tool to have, and many of our constituents would like the golden handcuffs to be replaced with the prison variety. Indeed, the images on US television of white-collar arrests and convictions have a powerful deterrent effect. My concern, however, is that if we look at the individual fines and enforcement to date, we see that the regulator has struggled to reach the evidential level required to prosecute individuals successfully. Now we are suggesting that it will have to meet a higher standard of proof to secure criminal convictions. It is a bit like asking a hurdler who has just failed at one level to jump over a much higher hurdle.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/6">The reversal of the burden of proof is one aspect of what we need, and the deterrent effect of criminal sanctions is another, because it brings with it the power of the headline. The question is, will we fall into the trap that we so often fall into in this House of passing legislation that sounds tough but proves difficult to use in practice? My fear is that the standard of proof required of the regulator to deliver a criminal prosecution will make it a tool that is rarely used.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/7">We therefore need to consider how we can target individuals, not firms, because that will drive the culture of firms. Currently, where there is wrongdoing, a firm will settle quickly and get a 30% discount. The more junior staff&#8212;the heads of the divisions responsible&#8212;are quickly exited, and the senior staff wilfully claim blindness, because the most controversial briefings are usually done orally. Reversing the burden of proof will address part of the ill, but through the new clause I wish to draw attention to the limitations of fines on firms, which at the end of the day penalise shareholders and pension funds. Our constituents pay twice&#8212;first for the bail-out, and then through the impact on their shareholding.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/8">That is why I would resist the temptation, however siren the voices, to follow the US model of much higher fines, even though the Government&#8217;s change, whereby fines will now go to good causes, is welcome. Under the Labour party, fines bizarrely benefited other banks, so the more banks behaved badly, the more other banks benefited. That was a bizarre incentive in the regulatory model that the current shadow Chancellor put in place, and I welcome the fact that we have fixed it. However, high fines against firms invariably punish the shareholders, not the senior executives responsible.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/9">When the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 first went through the House and was debated for many hours in the Chamber, it was felt that reputational harm would be a deterrent to firms. Indeed, the Act made specific reference to the fact that firms should be named, as though customers would be so shocked by the bad behaviour of a specific bank that they would take their business elsewhere. I think it is reasonable to conclude that shame has not had the intended effect. Indeed, when an executive can name a horse Fatcatinthehat, it is clear that shame is not a deterrent.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/10">New clause 2 would build on a fix that the Government have already put in place, the reversal of the burden of proof. The objective behind it is more modest than the</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/11">aspiration for criminal sanctions, which are attractive but, I fear, limited in their practical application. It is also intended to address a potential flaw in the parliamentary commission&#8217;s report, which was otherwise a first-class piece of work, whereby there will be a potential disincentive for executives to settle any enforcement action against their firm if in doing so they leave themselves open to individual fines.</p>
	<p pid="c.119.0/12">We need not more laws but to address the culture within banks and financial services. We pay senior executives in those institutions to assess risk. If the highest fine associated with the 2008 banking collapse is less than the bonuses of those executives in the preceding year, as is currently the case, it is logical that executives will assess the risk of being caught and of a paltry fine as being a risk worth taking. If the penalty is against the firm and not against them as individuals, that will further embolden them to take risks from which they personally benefit. That is why I seek to draw the Financial Secretary&#8217;s attention to the opportunity offered by new clause 2 to reverse the burden of proof without condition, so that we can hit those responsible for future failure personally and where it hurts most&#8212;in their pocket.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-07-08c.121.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" colnum="121"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#130708-0003.htm_spnew47">
	<p pid="c.121.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak to this group of new clauses, and I thank members of the banking commission&#8212;a number of whom are with us today&#8212;for their thoughtful work, and for the time and energy they put into ensuring that we had a series of recommendations, which have given us the opportunity to table a number of amendments in Committee and on Report.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/2">The Opposition tabled amendments in Committee to reflect the commission&#8217;s recommendations, but for various reasons&#8212;some of which I could understand and some of which I could not&#8212;the Government did not see fit to accept them. There was some disappointment when we got the opportunity to scrutinise the original Bill that it was so thin&#8212;to be fair, the Government recognised that in their response published today, but we must get to annex B2 to find that acknowledgment. At times it would have been good to have had a clearer indication of the Government&#8217;s direction of travel, and perhaps some of the details to discuss in Committee. As is often said, however, we are where we are, and we are now discussing the Bill in the context of the report published today.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/3">No doubt all Members have had the opportunity to read the Government&#8217;s report, which provides a slightly more detailed response to the report by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. There are, however, some areas where clarification or further information from the Minister would be helpful. The new clauses were tabled before we were aware of which provisions the Government intended to accept, and we may have tabled a number of them differently&#8212;or not at all&#8212;had we known their intentions. Nevertheless, there are a couple of issues that we believe are not covered by the report and the Government&#8217;s response.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/4">To put my remarks in context, the areas where quick implementation can be taken forward have been highlighted and the issues that require more detailed work have been identified. Where the Government do not agree with the commission has also identified. I will come to some specific issues in the new clauses, but it is worth</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/5">noting that the Government now accept the need for change and action in a number of areas in which the Opposition have consistently made the case on Second Reading, in Committee and today.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/6">The Government have announced plans to implement measures to improve individual accountability, and some of our new clauses relate to that in the overall context of conduct and remuneration. The Government have mentioned the tough new senior persons regime governing the behaviour of senior bank staff, outlined a willingness to take forward work on new banking standards rules to promote higher standards for bank staff, and&#8212;this was controversial in some quarters&#8212;we are pleased that they have at last decided to introduce a new criminal offence for reckless misconduct for senior bankers. We have heard from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40436" name="Stephen Barclay">the hon. Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay)</phrase> about reversing the burden of proof so that bank bosses are held accountable for breaches within their areas of responsibility. The Government have made further commitments to work with regulators to implement the commission&#8217;s proposals on pay, allowing bonuses to be deferred for up to 10 years, and enabling 100% clawback of bonuses where banks receive state aid. All those areas are relevant to our discussion.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/7">Some of the proposed reforms are either already enshrined in EU legislation or are part of forthcoming EU legislation, in some cases specifically relating to bonuses capped to salaries and bonus limits on bailed-out banks. Therefore, the Government would have had to consider the issue anyway, notwithstanding the fact that the Opposition have been pressing them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/8">On new clause 2, the hon. Member for North East Cambridgeshire spoke eloquently about the culture involved. We can debate legislation and change as many regulations as we like, but if we do not get into the heads of those who make decisions and create that culture, we will not change enough to ensure that past scenarios do not happen in the future. The hon. Gentleman said that he did not intend to push the new clause to the vote. I had assumed that perhaps the Government would have agreed to it and that he would have been acclaimed as the favoured son who had tabled a new clause that the Government accepted&#8212;and therefore his record would have been better than mine; throughout the Bill&#8217;s time in Committee, I managed to get only one word changed, much to the chagrin of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/9">New clause 3 was inspired by the commission, and builds on an amendment that was tabled in Committee and recommendations in the commission&#8217;s final report. It would introduce a licensing regime for</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/10">&#8220;all approved persons exercising controlled functions,&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/11">to ensure that such persons have adequate standards of competence and integrity. Again, that was a feature of the discussion in Committee, and we were keen for reforms to be brought forward to ensure that future banking misconduct is prevented, whether that is fixing LIBOR rates or mis-selling financial products. In Committee we argued that similar regimes have applied to other professionals, and there is no reason in principle why that should not be the case in the banking and financial services sector. Just as with lawyers, doctors or other professionals, misconduct in banking and financial services causes potential injury, injustice or financial loss. In the financial sector, the consequences and costs</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/12">of bad behaviour cost billions and harm the whole of society, so we believe it right to introduce safeguards similar to those in other professions.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/13">We tabled new clause 3 because we wanted to introduce our senior persons regime and revised set of banking standards rules, as recommended by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, and it is good that the Government intend to take that forward. In his response, will the Minister provide further flavour of how he intends to do that and give some detail, particularly on the scope of the legislation he proposes to introduce?</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/14">Why did the Government not feel able to introduce such a measure at an earlier stage in Committee? We would have welcomed the opportunity to scrutinise, discuss and probe the Bill in slightly more detail then. Will everything now be done in the other place, and will there be time for consideration in this Chamber? In his opening remarks I think the Minister gave an assurance that there would be ample opportunity to discuss those issues in the Chamber, but it is worth noting that when the Bill passes into statute as a result of all the work done to it, it will be very different to the one initially introduced, and it is right and proper that we have the opportunity to scrutinise it at every stage.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/15">The Minister will be familiar with the amendment that we tabled in Committee on the duty of care, and we have now tabled new clause 4, which would introduce duties of care for ring-fenced bodies&#8212;first, a fiduciary duty in relation to the carrying out of core services, and secondly a more general duty of care across the financial services sector. As I outlined in Committee, we bring this forward because we feel that it would send an important signal to the general public, who still have some way to go before trust is restored in the banking and financial services sector.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/16">The fiduciary duty, which characterises the requirement to serve in good faith, would help the banking sector focus on and return to some of its earlier principles connected with helping and informing customers, generating prosperity and not making a profit inappropriately from consumer inertia or ignorance. We know that the idea of the duty of care is supported by several external organisations because of the previous failures of the banks. For example, in March, a Which? survey found that banks were failing to give the right advice in many instances on transferring and managing cash ISAs. We had some discussion on that in Committee. As a test of that issue, Which? placed 180 calls to 15 leading banks and building societies to assess the quality of advice given to people who wanted to transfer their cash ISA savings. It said that several banks, including some of the major, well-known banks, failed to give correct answers to three simple cash ISA questions in more than half of the calls. That is the kind of thing that does not endear the financial institutions to the public, who want to believe that the banks have their best interests at heart as well as having the information on what would be best for them at their fingertips.</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/17">New clause 4 would enter on the statute book a concept that would add a great deal to ensuring that consumers could have that full confidence that their best interests were being served, and that those selling</p>
	<p pid="c.121.0/18">financial services products were doing so in a prudent and ethical manner. In terms of a stronger duty of care, the industry would have to take customers&#8217; interests into account not only when designing the products, but to be able to provide advice throughout their life cycle.</p>

	<p pid="c.124.0/1">The current regime for the regulator is &#8220;treating customers fairly&#8221;, which is exactly what the banks did not do in the PPI scandal. Does my hon. Friend agree that we need something stronger, and that a duty of care is a step in the right direction, signalling that we need to do something about the scandals that have happened in the past?</p>

	<p pid="c.124.1/1">My hon. Friend is right and he speaks with great experience, both because of the work he has done in this House and on the banking commission. He is right to say that the scandal of the PPI is exactly why today&#8217;s consumers want further assurances that the banking industry and the financial services sector are not simply about using consumers&#8217; possible lack of knowledge or understanding of the system to turn a quick profit with no thought to the longer term, either for the individuals or for the wider financial sector. That is why we have tabled the new clause.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.1/2">I suspect that the Minister may say much the same to me this evening as he said in Committee, as he felt that the amendment was unnecessary. Nor was it drafted in the most technically perfect way. However, it would be helpful if he were able to confirm that at the least the idea of a fiduciary duty&#8212;a duty of care&#8212;will be significant. I feel minded to test the will of the House on this new clause.</p>

	<p pid="c.124.3/1">I could go back through some of the issues that were raised in Committee. As I outlined, some of the duties that would be expected are those defined and accepted in common law already. What we want to do is try to put them in legislation to give a clear signal to consumers that things have changed and to try to rebuild trust in the banking system. I do not think that the customers of the banks think that it is unreasonable to have something that says that the banks should act in consumers&#8217; interests when looking after their money.</p>
	<p pid="c.124.3/2">New clause 5 reflects another amendment that we tabled in Committee. It is important to have assurances from the Government in the absence of knowing their intentions about remuneration reform. We tabled new clause 5 because we want the banks to take account of performance and stability over a five to 10-year period. That would reduce unnecessary risk-taking, force bankers to take a longer-term view, and end rewards for short-term profit. We tabled an amendment on this in Committee, and the parliamentary commission took a similar view in its report, which states:</p>
	<p pid="c.124.3/3">&#8220;The Commission recommends that the new Remuneration Code include a new power for the regulators to require that a substantial part of remuneration be deferred for up to 10 years, where it is necessary for effective long-term risk management.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.124.3/4">That was raised by the Treasury Committee in January, when the Bank of England director Andy Haldane called for various reforms.</p>

	<p pid="c.125.0/1">Does the hon. Lady not recognise that the difficulty with catch-all provisions, such as that for a 10-year period, is that they capture the good as much as the bad? New clause 2 would create targeted regulation to focus on those who have done wrong, instead of a catch-all provision that captures everyone.</p>

	<p pid="c.125.1/1">I might have been tempted to support new clause 2 had the hon. Gentleman decided to put it to the vote, and I look forward with interest to hearing what the Minister has to say. I understand the issues relating to length of time and the dangers of a catch-all provision but, in the aftermath of the banking crisis, the legal and regulatory structures, and the further changes that the Government promise to introduce, we need to ensure that the banking culture really changes. New clause 5 attempts to ensure that banks think for themselves about how to ensure that their performance is sustainable. Now that the Government have moved to an acceptance of the broad principle, the devil will be in the detail of what they do next. Perhaps the Minister will have more to say on that.</p>

	<p pid="c.125.2/1">The shadow Minister raises the 10-year deferral of bonuses recommended by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. We made that recommendation so that we could at least see the business of a bank through a business cycle, as it can take 10 years to expose irregularities. One problem occurs is that when people in receipt of such bonuses&#8212;there are already some deferred bonuses, in particular in UBS&#8212;want to move to another institution, they are bought out of their held-back bonus. Does the hon. Lady have any proposals to deal with that?</p>

	<p pid="c.125.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an extremely good point. It is perhaps worth remembering that not only did the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards make that recommendation, but Andy Haldane supported it when he came before the Treasury Committee. I am sure that the Minister will have something to say on that when he sets out his next set of actions.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/2">New clause 7 relates to protection for whistleblowers. It is important to ensure that workers are protected if they make a disclosure in the &#8220;reasonable belief&#8221; that misconduct has occurred, is occurring or could occur. The new clause would amend the Employment Rights Act 1996 and impose a duty on managers to inform the bank chairman&#8212;or chairwoman, if that is the case&#8212;of any report of wrongdoing that qualifies as a &#8220;protected disclosure&#8221;. This is an updated version of a clause tabled in Committee, and reflects the final report of the parliamentary commission, which in paragraph 788 states:</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/3">&#8220;A non-executive board member&#8212;preferably the Chairman&#8212;should be given specific responsibility under the Senior Persons Regime for the effective operation of the firm&#8217;s whistleblowing regime. That Board member must be satisfied that there are robust and effective whistleblowing procedures in place and that complaints are dealt with and escalated appropriately. It should be his or her personal responsibility to see that they are.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/4">In new clause 7 we are attempting to trigger a cultural change in the financial services sector. There is no doubt that a bank employee would wrestle with their conscience before deciding to break ranks. If an honest trader suspects wrongdoing and is considering informing the authorities, there must be protections to mitigate his or her fear of losing their job.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/5">The LIBOR scandal illustrates the importance of making it easier to report wrongdoing. At that time there was a quite a lot of speculation in the press and elsewhere about the accuracy of LIBOR, yet nobody came forward with the evidence. New clause 7 seeks to bolster the maintenance of law and order&#8212;I think everyone would generally agree with that&#8212;and would make it easier for the regulators and the banks&#8217; compliance teams to do their jobs.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/6">I looked closely at the Government&#8217;s response to the commission today, which says:</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/7">&#8220;The Government recognises the important role that whistleblowing can play in exposing wrongdoing&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/8">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/9">&#8220;BIS is publishing a &#8216;call for evidence&#8217; to establish a strong evidence base to help Government better understand the operation of the whistleblowing framework in today&#8217;s employment environment&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.125.3/10">It seems that the Government are now linking whistleblowing in the financial services sector with the wider review. We need to be careful about how a code of conduct, support for regulators and the role of regulators&#8212;including their interaction with employment tribunals, which is how the report couches this issue in context&#8212;are dealt with. Will the Minister say in his response when he anticipates the review being completed and what legislative vehicle would be proposed to implement any recommendations? It was not immediately apparent to me on reading the report that that had been established or thought through. Does he agree that any delay in dealing with the issue would risk putting that change out of sync with some of the other important changes that will be made to banking and the banking culture?</p>

	<p pid="c.126.0/1">I am following the hon. Lady&#8217;s argument with interest. Proposed new section 43B(g) of the Employment Rights Act 1996 refers to where</p>
	<p pid="c.126.0/2">&#8220;a breach of regulated activities under FSMA 2000&#8230;has been committed&#8230;or is likely to be committed.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="c.126.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a useful and probing point&#8212;I wish I had had the opportunity to probe the Government&#8217;s proposals in the same way. The point is to look at patterns of behaviour and conduct. The important thing is that this change or anything that the Government introduce should be robust and should stack up. That is why I was particularly keen to know how the Minister sees this issue being taken forward. However, I recognise that there is a wider context, so if he could respond by giving me some assurances on this issue, I would probably be tempted not to press new clause 7 to a vote.</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/2">Let me briefly mention new clause 11, which deals with criminal sanctions. New clause 11 was also inspired by the work of the Banking Commission. It would require the Government to bring forward proposals for the new offence of reckless misconduct in the management of a bank covering the people licensed under the senior persons regime and would seek civil recovery of money from people found guilty of the offence. Although that might be controversial in some areas, it is important. I welcome the fact that the Government now seem to be moving on this, and I await the detail with interest. It is</p>
	<p pid="c.126.1/3">vital that bankers are held to account for their actions. That is important not just for any action after a future crisis, but as a deterrent, should any bank executives be tempted to take unnecessary or reckless risks.</p>

	<p pid="c.127.0/1">I do not wish at this moment to be unduly partisan, but could the hon. Lady advise us on the evolution of the Opposition&#8217;s thinking? Was the imposition of criminal sanctions for the reckless management of banks discussed in the previous Government?</p>

	<p pid="c.127.1/1">As I am sure the hon.

I do, however, think it would be appropriate to look at the circumstances in which we are operating at present. In the same way as the hon. Gentleman did not wish to be partisan, I will resist the temptation to make an incredibly partisan response. Instead, I simply say it is important that the Government look at this. I welcome the fact that they seem to be willing to move on this, and the parliamentary commission was very clear that:</p>
	<p pid="c.127.1/2">&#8220;It is inappropriate that those found guilty of criminal recklessness should continue to benefit from remuneration obtained as a consequence of the reckless behaviour.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.127.1/3">That statement sits in the context of the issue of being able to claw back.</p>

	<p pid="c.127.2/1">This recommendation emerged from an all-party commission, with all parties supporting it.

	<p pid="c.127.3/1">Again, my hon. Friend makes an important point that this is an all-party stance and that everyone on the banking commission took this issue seriously.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/2">It is worth remembering that in response to a question from the Leader of the Opposition last month, the Prime Minister told the House that he would use this Bill to implement the report of the parliamentary commission. The Leader of the Opposition asked:</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/3">&#8220;Following the Parliamentary Commission on Banking, can the Prime Minister confirm that he supports its important recommendations on bonuses and criminal penalties, and that he will use the banking Bill to implement them?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/4">The Prime Minister responded:</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/5">&#8220;Yes, I do support both those measures...Penalising, including with criminal penalties against bankers who behave irresponsibly&#8212; I say yes. Also, making sure that for banks in receipt of taxpayers&#8217; money we can claw back and have a ban on bonuses&#8212;I say yes too.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/6">The Leader of the Opposition then asked a further question, to which the Prime Minister replied:</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/7">&#8220;We will be using that Bill to take these important steps.&#8221; &#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2013-06-19.883"><i>Official Report</i>, 19 June 2013; Vol. 564, c. 883</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/8">I hoped the Minister would have been able to bring forward appropriate amendments or new clauses&#8212;or whatever is needed&#8212;at this stage, rather than leaving</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/9">that to elsewhere. I hope he will be able to give us some further information on how the work will be progressed and when he now expects to give us more detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/10">New clause 13 relates to the financial services crime unit in the Serious Fraud Office. We raised this issue in Committee, and my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East gave an eloquent description of some of the areas that an FSCU would be able to address. This new clause would require the Treasury to report on the establishment of the FSCU and to do so within six months of the Act coming into force.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/11">I fear the Minister might sigh and think, &#8220;Here go the Opposition once again, asking for another report to be produced.&#8221; Before he says that or any Member seeks to intervene to make that point, I will say that the reason we are asking for these reports to be produced is to ensure that progress is made and that things do not just gather dust on a shelf somewhere.</p>
	<p pid="c.127.3/12">We know we have to look at the resources available to tackle white collar crime. Financial products are becoming ever more complex, and they are being traded faster, and increased resources could enable specialist police officers to develop their expertise. There are huge financial incentives in looking at developing this, too. It is worth remembering that fraud costs Britain about &#163;73 billion a year, according to the Home Office&#8217;s National Fraud Authority. As my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham East recalled in Committee, Andrew Bailey, the PRA chief executive, said it was &#8220;more than odd&#8221; that bank directors had not faced formal charges over the events leading up to the crisis. The Serious Fraud Office has a bit of a mixed record on tackling the high-profile cases. The Home Secretary was forced to perform a bit of a U-turn on her plans to abolish the SFO. It is clear that the SFO needs to be improved. The LIBOR scandal again shows that misconduct in financial services can have ramifications for traders, for industry, for shareholders, for the reputation of the City and, indeed, for criminal law.</p>

	<p pid="c.128.1/1">I am sure the hon. Gentleman will not be surprised to learn that I am not going to go into the detail of that case. He has had a career in the banking sector dealing with such issues, and he will be as aware as I am that looking at one case in isolation is sometimes not the best way to appreciate the overall picture. The overall picture is what I am interested in, and why I specifically mentioned LIBOR, because it is already a criminal offence to attempt to fix that rate. We need to seek to ensure that the SFO has the resources necessary to tackle this and to prevent any further scandals.</p>
	<p pid="c.128.1/2">We have tabled new clause 13 to give Parliament a chance, once again, further down the line to discuss the creation of a new agency, and we hope it would send a firm message to those tempted to engage in criminal conduct. I hope that the Minister may be able to say something more on that in his response. He did not seem to be persuaded in Committee of the need for a new unit or even a subdivision. My recollection is that</p>
	<p pid="c.128.1/3">he took that view, &#8220;Its all fraud and there is no need to have a specific unit or part of an organisation dealing with it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.128.1/4">I think I have covered a number of issues relating to these proposals. Once again, it is important to put on the record the fact that although we have had the opportunity to raise some of these issues in Committee and this evening, it is unfortunate that on Report we are not going to be able to scrutinise the detail of some of the new clauses&#8212;it is fair for us to assume that they might have been tabled at this stage. I seek the Minister&#8217;s further reassurance that we are going to get the important detail of how he intends to proceed, that we will see as much as is possible of the draft new clauses and legislation as things are taken forward, and that we will have an appropriate opportunity to discuss all that further in this place.</p>

I am not a member of the Treasury Committee, I was not a member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards and I was not even on the Public Bill Committee, so I hope that other hon.

	<p pid="c.129.2/1">I am grateful for that intervention. A lot in the commission&#8217;s recommendations reflects the seriousness with which it considered that point, and rightly so. In the intervening 12 months, I have dealt with constituents whose businesses have been put at risk because of the fraud of interest rate swap mis-selling and whose lives have been rent asunder by payment protection insurance mis-selling, and the Government have also taken action on the fiddling and fixing of LIBOR. Beyond that, some of us have been dealing with regulatory failures on Equitable Life. My view is</p>
	<p pid="c.129.2/2">that jail for such bankers and for those responsible is the only fair outcome for the victims of those scams. Despite the intervention from <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr Love)</phrase>, I must still ask where justice is to be found for the victims of those crimes in the recommendations and in the amendments tabled today.</p>
	<p pid="c.129.2/3">Banking is full of honest and decent men and women. As my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40436" name="Stephen Barclay">the Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay)</phrase> said, one of the attractions of new clause 2 is that it focuses like a laser beam on the individuals who are responsible and culpable. If we fail to do that and those people do not go to jail, where is the justice for all the other people who work in financial services honestly on behalf of their clients every day?</p>
	<p pid="c.129.2/4">It is not a habit of this House to consider retrospective legislation, but I want to mention that in a minute. First, let me ask the Minister a couple of questions. In the senior persons regime and the actions that would be covered by new clause 11, the focus is on named individuals at the top. As we saw in the interest rate swaps, a lot of the decisions made by the senior ranks at the banks were translated into budgets and business plans and transferred down through the hierarchy of the banks. Perhaps the Minister, when he considers the issue of conduct, could answer the question of how those extensions beyond the senior persons regime will be handled.</p>

	<p pid="c.130.0/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for his comments about my contribution to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. He raises a number of points and as the chairman of the sub-panel that considered below board level corporate governance I can say to him that the management structures of banks are so fiendishly complex that there is little way that the senior managers of banks can translate their wishes all the way down to the bottom. Other evidence gave reasons why the senior management in banks can effectively set up what amounts to an accountability firewall, thereby putting wilful ignorance between them and the activities that go on in the front line and absolving themselves from any responsibility for any misconduct at the bottom end of the bank. That is a very serious issue.</p>

	<p pid="c.130.1/1">I am grateful for that intervention, but I do not want to attempt to get into the debate that the commission has considered thoroughly and much more knowledgably than I would be able to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.1/2">The House does not frequently indulge in passing retrospective legislation, but if the senior persons regime is appropriate, is there merit in applying it retrospectively, if only in the form of an exercise through which to judge the conduct of those involved in financial services&#8212;in the banks and elsewhere? Whether that took the form of a self-audit conducted by the financial institutions themselves, or further work for the banking commission, to the extent to which that would be feasible, it would be welcome.</p>
	<p pid="c.130.1/3">Much of the commission&#8217;s work relates to sanctions that would be applied to those directly in the financial institutions themselves, but what about others? My hon. Friend the Member for North East Cambridgeshire</p>
	<p pid="c.130.1/4">talked about the role of auditors, but why are the regulators allowed to get off scot-free? Why are there no criminal sanctions for those who set the regulations?</p>
	<p pid="c.130.1/5">I was extremely pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase>, for whom I have tremendous admiration, spoke about new clause 11 only lightly, because it would be unwise for her to press the point behind the measure too strongly, given that it seems to some people that the previous Government idled by and doled out knighthoods, but never thought about jail. Where on earth was the thought about the people who were suffering owing to the scandals that were under way at that time? I was pleased that she did not press her point aggressively because, as we deal with the current problems, it is clear to many of us whose fingers are all over the crime. We do not need an Inspector Luther or a Miss Marple to know that people in government were responsible for setting the framework under which criminal activity was allowed to run rife. Many of us believe that it is not just the bankers who should hold their heads in shame, but the people in charge of regulation at that time.</p>

	<p pid="c.131.0/1">Does my hon. Friend share my incredulity that when David Strachan conducted his review at the Financial Services Authority following the Legal and General case and brought forward his recommendations for a light-touch enforcement regime, the vice-chair of the FSA was Sir James Crosby, who is one of the three figures who are especially criticised in the banking commission&#8217;s report? We have a multi-layered, light-touch enforcement regime that often creates a disincentive to the regulator&#8212;this is why market abuse often involves criminal sanctions, not civil sanctions. One of the people criticised in the banking commission report actually designed the system that applies to the regulator.</p>

	<p pid="c.131.1/1">I am appreciative of that intervention, which adds not only to my body of knowledge, but to the commonly held disgust that, following all these efforts involving the best minds we can put in place, no one is going to jail. In the absence of anyone going to jail, we have gone through all the fraud, all the mis-structured, light-touch regulation and all the mis-positioning of responsibilities without a single person being truly accountable. If there is a point on which I disagree with my hon. Friend, which I rarely do, it is that he said in his speech that financial penalties are likely to be more successful. He might have a point in saying that there will be more successful prosecutions, but the loss of one&#8217;s liberty cannot be put in a discounted cash flow&#8212;there cannot be a beta high enough. If we want to change behaviour, we have to show that people will go to jail and lose their liberty. If, having gone through the worst financial recession that we have experienced in our lifetimes, not a single person goes to jail as a result of all our work, I do not care that there is a cross-party consensus because, in my view, this is failing the people.</p>

	<p pid="c.132.0/1">I must admit that I am not particularly familiar with Iceland&#8212;certainly not as familiar as the hon. Gentleman is&#8212;but he makes an important contribution. Other regimes look at things differently, and are far stricter than we are. Normally, we would look at how United States regulations dealt with some of these things. In the past, they have been more successful than they have been recently as regards criminal prosecutions in financial services. Many people in the United States were held criminally responsible for their actions in the savings and loans scandal; the same has not happened in this financial crisis.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.0/2">I respect the work of the commission, and I am nowhere near as smart as it is on these issues, but I have to say that no one has gone to jail, and that is not good enough.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-07-08c.132.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" speakername="Andrew Love" colnum="132"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#130708-0004.htm_spnew25">
	<p pid="c.132.1/1">I will comment on the commission&#8217;s thought processes on some of the issues that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. He will remember, as we all do, the evening on which we set up a special parliamentary vehicle in the wake of the LIBOR rate-rigging scandal. Since 2008, there have been a variety of critical events, including the credit crunch and the recession. All that led to a catastrophic decline in the reputation of the financial services sector. Trust in bankers sank to an all-time low, and frankly LIBOR was the last straw. This was truly shocking behaviour on an unprecedented scale. Something had to be done, and the focus was very much on our terms of reference on standards and culture.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/2">As a result, the commission had to answer some tough questions, and the hon. Gentleman has posed some of them: why had so few bankers been held to account for their failings? Why had it appeared that bankers pocketed the gains, but passed on the losses to the taxpayer? Why were customers who should have been treated fairly treated in the exact opposite way&#8212;a point that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> raised? We tried to answer those questions through three themes that came out in our report. The first theme is individual responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/3">When all the head bankers came before us, we were genuinely shocked to hear that they denied any responsibility for what happened in their banks. Whether it was ignorance of the serious failings happening under their noses, or because there was collective decision making, the result was the same: no one could be held to account. That, we discovered, was the result of the failure of the approved persons regime, which did not attribute responsibilities to senior staff, who, as a result, could not be held to account.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/4">Two steps are proposed to try to address that problem. First, we have already mentioned the new senior persons regime, designed to ensure that the most important responsibilities are assigned to specific individuals, who will more easily be held to account for them. Secondly, for a much wider group&#8212;not every employee, but those who could do serious harm to the bank, or its customers, due to their customer-facing position&#8212;we propose a new licensing regime, with a set of banking standard rules that enable them to be held to account.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/5">However, for people to be held to account, we need more effective sanctions, and that is the second theme of the commission&#8217;s report. Identification of those responsible under the new regime will provide a stronger basis for the regulator to enforce existing civil penalties, such as</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/6">fines, restrictions and bans. One of the great difficulties was assigning responsibility; we hope that individual responsibility will address that.</p>
	<p pid="c.132.1/7">Given the seriousness of the wrongdoings&#8212;an issue mentioned in earlier contributions&#8212;the commission is recommending two new, far-reaching powers. New clause 2 does not address this point, but under certain conditions, the regulator should be able to impose a full range of civil sanctions, unless the person can demonstrate that reasonable steps were taken to prevent or mitigate the failing. In effect, that does what new clause 2 suggests: it reverses the burden of proof, but only under certain conditions.</p>

	<p pid="c.133.0/1">In essence, the hon. Gentleman is describing the purpose of new clause 2. Earlier, I alluded to the fact that there is a condition that militates against the effectiveness of the new clause: the tool can be used only if there is a successful prosecution, which gets in the way. As much as I agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase>, does <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr Love)</phrase> agree that we need to be careful about changing the law retrospectively, particularly on custodial sentences? One of the issues that we are addressing today is how we get it right for the future, and what the sanctions should be.</p>

	<p pid="c.133.1/1">Personally, I oppose retrospective legislation. It was not considered by the commission, which does not make any recommendations on it. I suspect, however, that none of its members would be in favour of addressing these issues in that way.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/2">The other change is the much publicised criminal offence of reckless misconduct in the management of a bank, which normally carries, as has been suggested, a custodial sentence. Importantly, we have laid down preconditions before a charge of that nature can be brought. There must be a cost to the taxpayer&#8212;the bank has turned to the taxpayer to bail it out; or there are consequences for the financial system&#8212;stability is critical, and anything that destabilises the system should be subject to a criminal sanction; or there is serious harm to customers. We think that we have framed a big change in the law. Bankers continually ask why they are singled out as the only commercial group that can be charged in that way. It is a delicate balance, and I hope that the Government will look seriously at what we are trying to do.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/3">The third area I want to touch on is remuneration and incentives. The reality is that rewards have been huge, and still are huge for a more limited supply of senior bankers. That incentivises excessive risk taking and, occasionally, misconduct. The commission concluded that risk and reward are still misaligned, particularly when making pay awards over a short period. It therefore sees advantages in making a significant portion of remuneration variable, rather than fixed. We do not have much sympathy for the European solution in relation to that, but we think that reform is necessary in this area. More variable pay should be deferred to take into account changing circumstances at the bank at which the banker works, with power for the regulator to extend the period for up to 10 years. To those who say that that is a long time, many banks have a good year, but then some less good years, and the commission wanted to recognise that that can go on for an extended period.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/4">Regulators should be able to limit or prohibit sales-based incentives. We were shocked at the way in which sales-based incentives were used to create the mis-selling scandals of PPI and interest rate swaps. There was a cascading group of incentives from senior management through to the customer-facing end of the bank, and we think that that made a major contribution to the problems that arose. We want to give the regulator much stronger powers. Where a bank requires taxpayer support, the regulator should have discretionary power to cancel all deferred compensation. It is shocking that, as happened in some banks, they were still paying remuneration to employees after the bank had taken on taxpayer funds.</p>
	<p pid="c.133.1/5">The issues of conduct and remuneration that I have raised lie at the heart of what the commission thinks needs to be done in respect of culture and standards. These recommendations have been much debated and discussed. We have done everything we can to make them practical and realisable, and I hope that, when there is an opportunity to debate them in the other House, or when they come back to this place, the Government will give serious consideration to those recommendations.</p>

	<p pid="c.134.0/1">I shall make two brief points. First, I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40436" name="Stephen Barclay">the Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay)</phrase> on drawing attention to something very important to the House&#8212;that it is this Government who have got behind the idea that there should be, in certain limited circumstances, a custodial sentence for breach of a new criminal offence. It is worth reminding ourselves that although the crash occurred in autumn 2008, the then Labour Government had 2009 and the first five months of 2010 to do something about it, but it is this Government who have made their intentions clear regarding custodial sentences. For that, Ministers should be congratulated.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/2">The second and final point is that we cannot let this debate pass without reminding ourselves of the fact that existing criminal law was not being enforced in relation to the allegations of LIBOR rigging. The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards came into existence as a direct result of the allegations about rigging the LIBOR market. The custodial sentences available for those activities were not seriously taken on board by the Serious Fraud Office, for in 2011, it is said, the SFO inquired into whether existing criminal offences had been committed by those manipulating the LIBOR market, and concluded that they had not.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/3">This time last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer told the House that he would ask the Serious Fraud Office to take another look to see whether criminal offences had been committed under existing criminal law. Leading counsel advised me and I said in the Chamber that there were, on the face of it, breaches of section 2 of the Theft Act 1968 through false accounting, the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud, breach of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and possibly even breaches under the Fraud Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/4">Although the Minister clearly cannot intervene in investigations by the Serious Fraud Office because prosecutorial authorities are quite separate from the Executive, which has always been the case and will, I am sure, continue to be the case for centuries to come, it would be useful for him to indicate what the state of</p>
	<p pid="c.134.0/5">play is in relation to breaches of existing criminal law that might give rise to custodial sentences in the case of those engaged in LIBOR rigging.</p>

	<p pid="c.135.0/1">It is a pleasure to respond to this well-informed debate. I start by welcoming <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40342" name="Cathy Jamieson">the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson)</phrase> to the Opposition Dispatch Box. She proved rather more persuasive in Committee than her hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40460" name="Christopher Leslie">the Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie)</phrase>, as I was able to accept at least one of her amendments. I think that it was a single word, but I am sure that it was an excellent one, historically so.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/2">We are considering a large group of amendments, as has been evident in the range of the debate, and it has given us the opportunity to have an initial discussion of the parliamentary commission&#8217;s recommendations on questions of individual accountability and corporate governance. We agree with the recommendations that have been made. The commission&#8217;s report has at its heart the essential point that the UK banking system depends totally on the trust it commands. If it cannot count on the trust of its customers, it cannot truly serve businesses and people, which is the only purpose of banking. If it cannot count on the trust of businesses and people in this country, it cannot possibly sustain a reputation for international pre-eminence, which is what we all want to see.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/3">The commission&#8217;s conclusions are comprehensive. Never again must directors of banks be able to preside expensively over failure or misconduct and then claim that they simply did not know what was going on. Never again must banks simply, as the commission sees it, contract out ethical judgments to the regulator. Never again must senior bankers be able to make one-way bets with the money of ordinary working people and walk away financially unscathed, leaving taxpayers with a crippling bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/4">Specifically, we will enact the new senior persons regime that the commission proposes and introduce new banking standards rules to require high standards among all staff. We will introduce the new criminal offence of reckless misconduct that has been suggested for senior bankers. We will reverse the burden of proof so that the bosses are held accountable for breaches within their areas of responsibility. We will work with the regulators to implement the commission&#8217;s proposals to defer bonuses for up to 10 years and to enable 100% clawback of bonuses where banks receive state aid. We will ask the regulators to implement the commission&#8217;s recommendations on corporate governance to ensure that firms have the correct systems in place to identify risks and maintain standards of ethics. As I have said in earlier debates, where legislation is required, we will propose amendments in the autumn in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/5">Let me deal specifically with today&#8217;s amendments and new clauses. New clause 2 was ably moved by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40436" name="Stephen Barclay">the Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay)</phrase>. In a powerful speech delivered without notes, he explained that the new clause seeks to reverse the burden of proof when taking action against a senior person where there are regulatory failings by a firm in that person&#8217;s area of responsibility. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40243" name="Andrew Love">the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr Love)</phrase> pointed out, that is one of the parliamentary commission&#8217;s recommendations, but I think</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/6">that my hon. Friend campaigned for that even before the Commission reported, drawing on his own experience as a regulator. I say to the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun that my hon. Friend needs no tawdry trinket of the Government accepting his amendment to be lionised in this House for the contribution he has made. We very much accept the thrust of his recommendation and that of the parliamentary commission.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/7">The PCBS put it this way:</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/8">&#8220;Senior managers of banks will no longer be able to hide behind an accountability firewall, where they are too distant from the consequences of their responsibilities to be held directly accountable when things go wrong.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/9">At present, the regulator has to be able to show that the person knew what was going on. That cannot be right. It means that while regulators can take action against the firm&#8217;s junior employees who might be implicated, they are unable to pin responsibility on someone higher up the chain just because, as the Commission put it, the e-mail trail goes cold when it reaches their level of management. I will take on board the case my hon. Friend made on whether it is necessary to require the corporate offence to be committed, and we will reflect on that before the Bill goes to the Lords.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/10">New clause 3 reproduces a new clause that was considered in Committee, when I predicted that the parliamentary commission would have something to say about the approved persons regime and a code of conduct. My predictions proved uncannily accurate. The commission&#8217;s recommendation that the approved persons regime should be replaced is, of course, a major feature of its report, which we accept. We will bring forward amendments to introduce the new senior persons regime to replace FSMA&#8217;s approved persons regime. As the commission recommends, the new regime will ensure that key responsibilities within banks are assigned to specific individuals who are aware of those responsibilities and have formally accepted them. As part of the regime, we will implement the commission&#8217;s more detailed recommendations, including reversing the burden of proof, which I have just mentioned, and allowing regulators to make the approval of senior persons subject to conditions and time limits.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/11">The regulators will also be able to make rules about the conduct of senior persons, replacing the current system of statements of principle and codes of practice. The new clauses will put in place new arrangements for regulating the conduct of individuals who are not covered by the senior persons regime. The arrangements will include provisions to allow the regulators to make rules covering financial services employees whose appointments are not subject to regulatory pre-approval.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/12">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> is absolutely right: it is plausible that the deficiencies in the approved persons regime may affect not just the banking sector but other parts of the financial services industry. The relevant FSMA provisions apply to all parts of the sector, so it might be operationally simpler to apply the regime to the industry as a whole. The Government will consider, with the regulators, whether the relevant provisions should allow for the wider application that my hon. Friend has in mind.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/13">As the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun said, new clause 3 would not deliver the extent of the reforms that the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards is seeking. On that basis, I hope that the hon. Lady will withdraw the new clause.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/14">New clause 4 also reflects a debate that we had in Committee. The commission did not recommend the introduction of a fiduciary duty or duty of care, but it did recommend an alternative route. It said that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills should consult on changing the duties of the directors of ring-fenced banks, to prioritise the safety and soundness of the firm first, over the interests of shareholders.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/15">The Government strongly believe that bank directors must maintain an awareness of their responsibility to safeguard the security and stability of the firm. Changes that will support a focus on stability and soundness&#8212;for example, giving directors specific duties under the proposed senior persons regime&#8212;will help. We will indeed consult on whether changing directors&#8217; duties will help further to accomplish those intentions. I hope that that will reassure the hon. Lady.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/16">A duty of care specifically towards customers across the financial sector is difficult to make sense of, as we have previously discussed. Would it mean, for example, that a bank had a duty of care not just to its own customers and those of its competitors but, as the proposed duty is to customers across the financial sector, the customers of an insurance company with no relevance to the firm itself? The new clause has been tabled to confirm the Government&#8217;s intentions on the wider duties of banks and their directors, and I hope that the hon. Lady is satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/17">New clause 5 refers to remuneration. Of course, the Government have already taken significant steps in that regard; under the remuneration code, large parts of bonuses must be deferred and paid in shares, and cash bonuses must be limited. However, it is a question of not just the quantum of bonuses, but how they are decided in the first place. Next year, shareholders will have a binding vote on executive pay.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/18">We strongly support the proposals made by the parliamentary commission. In particular, the commission has recommended that the regulator should have the power to require a substantial part of remuneration to be deferred for up to 10 years when that is necessary for effective long-term risk management. There is a subtle but critical distinction between the commission&#8217;s recommendation and the new clause. The power should be with the regulator to determine whether and in what circumstances to require extended deferral; my hon. Friend the Member for North East Cambridgeshire made that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/19">The commission has commented that no single deferral period is appropriate but that it should be determined in accordance with the nature of each business and the risks and activities of the employee in question. The Government agree and will ask the PRA to consider the powers that it has to extend deferral periods as part of its consultation on implementing the commission&#8217;s proposals. I hope that that commitment will reassure the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and that she will not feel the need to press the matter further.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/20">New clause 7 deals with protections for whistleblowers. As the hon. Lady said, we debated this in Committee, so I do no want to detain the House further today other than to reassure her that, as I explained on that occasion, these provisions already exist in legislation. Disclosures about criminal offences are already covered by the Employment Rights Act 1996. Disclosures about regulatory</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/21">breaches are covered by FSMA. This proposal would cover, for example, disclosures about the breaches of the regulatory requirements in relation to the ring-fence. I assume that the second requirement is designed to give effect to the commission&#8217;s proposal that a non-executive board member, preferably the chairman, should be given specific responsibility under the senior persons regime. Again, the powers to enact this are already available to the regulator under FSMA, and we have indicated that we support the thrust of these recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="c.135.0/22">The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills will shortly launch a call for evidence on whistleblowing generally. This will help the Government to establish the evidence base in looking at whistleblowing protections and considering whether further changes are required. The commission&#8217;s recommendations on whistleblowing will be considered in that context.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-07-08c.138.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" speakername="Greg Clark" colnum="138"  time="021:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#130708-0004.htm_spnew31">
	<p pid="c.138.1/1">This summer.</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/2">New clause 11 concerns the new criminal offence of reckless misconduct recommended by the parliamentary commissioner. As we have already announced, we agree with the commission&#8217;s recommendations and will over the summer draft amendments to create such a legally watertight criminal offence, including compliance with the European convention on human rights. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford suggested, the commission did not recommend retrospectivity, and these provisions are intended to enact its recommendations. I hope that he will understand that.</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/3">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40136" name="David Ruffley">the Member for Bury St Edmunds (Mr Ruffley)</phrase> was absolutely right to point out that it was of course this Government who first raised the possibility of criminal sanctions for managerial misconduct in July last year. We are grateful to the commission for its extensive work. We will follow its advice on misconduct committed by persons covered by the regime that is being set up. The commission noted the legal challenges involved in mounting a successful prosecution, but we absolutely agree that the creation of this offence should be justified by the signal that it sends and the potential deterrent effects it can have. We have to make it clear that reckless behaviour by those in charge of our banks cannot be tolerated.</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/4">New clause 13 proposes to create a new financial services crime unit. A similar amendment was discussed at some length in Committee. I can assure hon. Members that the Government fully recognise the importance of tackling financial crime. There is to be a dedicated command within the new National Crime Agency responsible for directing the national response to economic and financial crimes. The economic crime command will have a clear remit to reduce the threat from economic and financial crimes, working collaboratively across the different sectors. Substantial progress has already been made in establishing the National Crime Agency and driving early operational success against criminals who seek to engage in economic and financial crimes.</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/5">The Government accept the broad recommendations of the parliamentary commission on each of these matters. We will be acting quickly to take the opportunity afforded by this Bill to make amendments that are</p>
	<p pid="c.138.1/6">legally watertight and likely to pass into law in the early part of next year, just six months after the parliamentary commission&#8217;s extensive report. In acting in this way, we are keeping faith not only with the recommendations of the parliamentary commission but with the urgency of the need to enact these reforms, which I commend to the House.</p>

Friend the Minister about the Government&#8217;s willingness to look at the outcome that new clause 2 seeks, which is in line with the comments made by Members across the House.

	<p pid="c.148.2/1">The very first time that a son or daughter is asked by one of their parents, &#8220;And who exactly are you?&#8221;, is a chilling and frightening experience. It is a question of good days and bad days. In most cases there will be many good days&#8212;many fun days. It is not the end of the world, but it is very much the end of a world that the son or daughter knew. My hon. Friend the Minister is more conversant with the figures than I am, but they are startling for us as a nation. Some 800,000 people suffer from dementia. We are told that the figure will increase to 1 million in the next 10 years or so. The Alzheimer&#8217;s Society believes that the cost to us as nation of supporting those people is &#163;23 billion, and that is with only half of those who have dementia being diagnosed with it.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/2">However, I am here to tell a good story, about the work going on in Bradford. I would not be forgiven by Cathy Henwood, the dementia-friendly communities co-ordinator in the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society, if I did not point out that we were doing dementia-friendly work in Bradford before the Prime Minister&#8217;s challenge, which I will return to later. The dementia measures taken in Bradford have been well supported by the council. Stage one of the work included the recruitment of a small pilot group of organisations, such as the gurdwara, the Church of England, the community centre, a local branch of Lloyds TSB, a pharmacy and others. They were asked to review their organisations and write action plans. A checklist was produced by the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society to help them do that. That list was developed with people who had dementia and those who cared for people with dementia.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/3">The second stage of the work is where my patch of Idle, where I live, came in. It is a village&#8212;yes, I was an Idle councillor for 26 years. The Alzheimer&#8217;s Society developed a community-based approach to supporting people with dementia which started in Idle and Thackley. The area happens to have three Liberal Democrat councillors, I am pleased to say, and they were determined to put together supportive structures for those with dementia in their ward development plans. Councillor Jeanette Sunderland leads the Lib Dem group. She and her colleagues Councillors Griffiths and Reid, working with the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society, held a community meeting on a bleak and snowy day in January&#8212;we do have some bleak and snowy days in Bradford in January. It was nearly cancelled but it went ahead despite the weather, and 40 participants turned up and 14 people signed up and agreed to stay involved. That meeting was partly for awareness raising, with a speaker who had dementia, and with information about the effects of dementia and how to help, and it was also partly a consultation, with discussion about what is good about living in Idle and what would be problematic for people with memory problems&#8212;what could be changed, and so forth.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/4">A number of subsequent meetings have been held, as was a support group meeting, with both carers and those with dementia, at a volunteer event. All was going well. As of April, with some funding from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Bradford council, this work</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/5">was looking to expand out of one ward out of the 30 in Bradford to work with 20 communities in total over a two-year period.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/6">There was an announcement in the <i>Telegraph and Argus </i>about the Bradford District Dementia Action Alliance, which had brought together lots of groups and organisations, including the Yorkshire police, the Bradford royal infirmary and St Luke&#8217;s hospital, Bradford university and Bradford college. They have now been granted early adopter status for the dementia-friendly community recognition programme.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/7">This is all really good news, added to which I believe it is important to congratulate the coalition Government on the focus they have placed on this, for example with the Prime Minister&#8217;s welcome launch of the dementia challenge. So far, so good, then.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/8">The background to this at the national level is as follows. There is a &#163;2.68 billion reduction in adult social care funding either so far or through to March 2014, and locally a 16% reduction over the last two years in adult and community service budgets, which amounts to &#163;23 million in Bradford. A joint survey by Age UK and the College of Social Work found that 94% of people witnessed a squeeze on budgets for care services in the past three years, and 81% said they were seeing negative impacts on social care.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/9">The Minister will, I am sure, refer to the Government funding that has recently been made available. That is focused on the crucial integration of health and social care, but integration can happen at any level of support, of course. Eligibility is the gateway to support; it provides the level at which a person can access support. As the Minister well knows, Bradford&#8217;s council is consulting on changing the criteria in Bradford, and that consultation will run until <phrase class="date" code="2013-08-04">4 August</phrase>. I am pleased to say that on <phrase class="date" code="2013-07-15">15 July</phrase> the former care Minister, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40594" name="Paul Burstow">the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow)</phrase>, will be coming to Bradford to launch the Bradford Cares campaign, which is supported by Scope. It is running a national campaign, but we will run a local version of it, in which we will seek to persuade the people of Bradford to support our campaign against the council&#8217;s proposed changes. We feel it is particularly relevant to those with dementia because, as the Minister knows, people with dementia are often physically able. With a little help and support, they are quite capable of looking after themselves.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/10">When I was a councillor chairing the area committee we looked at the issues affecting elderly people and we assumed that they would relate to benefits, housing, adaptations and so on. It became evident that the crucial issue facing many elderly people was isolation, the impact of which, as we know, can lead to a deterioration in a person&#8217;s condition, particularly if they have dementia. Early intervention, not integrated intervention, is the key. This is about providing moderate care not only because it is relatively inexpensive, but because we know that investing in this form of support can save up to 130%.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/11">If Bradford council&#8217;s decision goes through, it could well affect 2,000 people. We believe that if the council is doing this on the basis of concern about cost, it is very much a false economy, as it will cost the council more in the long term. I fear that despite the great strides that will be made by finally having integrated care systems, a change in eligibility thresholds will mean that hundreds</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/12">of thousands of people will still not get the key early and preventive care about which I know the Minister cares passionately. They will not receive the care that they so desperately need and that is why it is so important to consider the eligibility criteria. As the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society has highlighted,</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/13">&#8220;setting the eligibility threshold at substantial will fail to make the shift to a system of prevention whereby people get the support they need to cope at home and avoid unplanned admissions to hospital and residential care.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/14">My Liberal Democrat colleagues on Bradford council have put down a motion for debate tomorrow, applauding the work that is going on in Bradford, particularly the Bradford District Dementia Action Alliance. We have had some cross-party coalition work on dealing with dementia, and I urge all Bradford councillors to support that motion, with the goal of making Bradford a dementia-friendly district by 2015. The dictionary definition of &#8220; to care&#8221; is to</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/15">&#8220;take thought for, provide for, look after, take care of&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/16">We must take care, and we must not care less.</p>
	<p pid="c.148.2/17">I look forward in particular to the Minister&#8217;s response on integration. I know he sees it as a great opportunity, but my concern is that unless it operates at an appropriate level we will not only lose the savings that are possible through preventive work but see a deterioration in many people&#8217;s conditions and a growing cost. We are still at an early stage in the development of the health and wellbeing boards, and change is also happening in the national health service as a whole. These are risky days for many people, and although the additional funding to support integration must be welcomed, we must ensure that it is at the appropriate level.</p>

	<p pid="c.150.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40108" name="David Ward">the Member for Bradford East (Mr Ward)</phrase> on securing the debate and on all the work he has done both in Bradford and to bring the stories from Bradford to a national forum. He has done more than anyone to highlight the importance of care services and working with the community to improve services for people. Indeed, the extraordinary consultation exercise he undertook following the White Paper last year was an exemplar of how to engage with the local community. The extent to which people felt able to comment and give their views and ideas was commendable.</p>
	<p pid="c.150.0/2">I also congratulate the Bradford District Dementia Action Alliance on its work. My hon. Friend made the point that Cathy Henwood from the Alzheimer&#8217;s Society had identified Bradford as developing the concept of dementia-friendly communities before the Prime Minister&#8217;s dementia challenge, but I am pleased that he acknowledged that the Government have done a lot to highlight the importance of improving dementia care. The Prime Minister&#8217;s dementia challenge highlighted three strands: improving health and care services; creating dementia-friendly communities, which is exactly what is happening in Bradford; and a much greater focus on research so that we can find cures, understand better how to prevent some types of dementia, such as vascular dementia, and understand through research how best to care for people with dementia. The Government are more than doubling the amount spent on research, which is a good thing in itself.</p>

	<p pid="c.151.1/1">Idle and Thackley&#8212;those wonderful names. Local councillors got the community involved and that is exactly what needs to happen. When we talk about how to meet the extraordinary challenges of the future, with an ageing community, there must ultimately be collaboration between statutory services and the community. Bradford appears to be showing the way in which that can be done and I stress that it requires the integration of services and care shaped around the needs of the individual with preventive care to stop the deterioration in their condition.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.1/2">My hon. Friend will be aware of the need for the care and support system to change as local authorities faces challenges resulting from an ageing population. That is why the coalition Government have decided to reform the system of care and support. He talked about the situation in Bradford and I understand that more than 71,000 people there are aged 65 and over, about 14% of its total population. Bradford&#8217;s joint strategic needs assessment for 2012 predicts that by 2033&#8212;not that far off&#8212;the number of local people over 90 will increase from 2,800 to 8,700, an increase of more than 200%. We all face an extraordinary challenge.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.1/3">As we debate access to care and support services, I am aware that City of Bradford metropolitan district council sets its eligibility criteria at moderate. The report that my hon. Friend published earlier in the year indicated that 97% of people who replied to his survey welcomed setting the eligibility criteria at that level. Bradford council now proposes to change its band to substantial, because of pressures on its budget, and that would affect about 25% of people who currently receive care and support. I completely understand that the Bradford Cares campaign wishes to ensure that services are maintained at the existing level.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.1/4">The care and support White Paper, which was published in July 2012, is an important and fundamental step towards addressing the challenges of an ageing society. Our reforms will focus more attention on people&#8217;s well-being&#8212;that is at the centre of everything that the Care Bill tries to achieve&#8212;and independence throughout their lives, rather than waiting for people to reach crisis point. They will also put people in control by giving them a far greater say about their care and support, as well as by ensuring that services are designed around what people actually want and by putting their priorities and preferences above and beyond the needs of the institution. My hon. Friend will be aware that the Care Bill, which has been widely welcomed, will be a single, modern statute for care and support. It will make legislation clearer and fairer, and it will be built around people not processes, and individuals not institutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.1/5">As the Government&#8217;s White Paper made clear, our vision is a modern care and support system that promotes people&#8217;s well-being by enabling them to prevent and postpone the need for care and support, and that puts them in control of their lives so that they may pursue opportunities, including education and employment, and realise their potential. Assessments will remain an</p>
	<p pid="c.151.1/6">integral part of the system, but rather than them acting primarily as a gateway to the adult receiving care and support&#8212;or not, if they fail the assessment&#8212;the future system will place much more emphasis on the role of the assessment process in supporting people to identify their needs, to understand the options available, to plan for meeting care needs and caring responsibilities, and to reduce or delay needs, when possible.</p>
	<p pid="c.151.1/7">Any adult who appears to the local authority to have care and support needs, whatever the level of need, has the right to an assessment. That right will cover carers, so this is an extension of their existing rights. The low threshold for entitlement to an assessment will mean that authorities will have earlier contact with far more people with low-level needs.</p>

	<p pid="c.152.0/1">May I say how much I welcome the policy on the assessment of carers? Many carers who visit my constituency office are on the verge of needing care themselves because of the stress that they are under. It is the failure to identify their personal needs and the support that they require that puts them in such a stressful position.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-07-08c.152.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40443" speakername="Norman Lamb" colnum="152"  time="022:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#130708-0004.htm_spnew37">
	<p pid="c.152.1/1">My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The Care Bill&#8217;s provisions on carers represent an enormously welcome advance. In a sense, they will give carers the same entitlements to assessment and then support, if that is deemed necessary, as the people for whom they care.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/2">The &#8220;Fair access to care services&#8221; framework was introduced in 2003. It aimed to provide a fairer and more transparent system for the allocation of social care services. The assessment and eligibility framework was reproduced in the &#8220;Putting People First&#8221; guidance that was published in 2010. The current assessment and eligibility framework is graded into four bands: critical; substantial, which is the case for most local authorities; moderate, which applies to Bradford and some 15 other authorities; and low, which covers only two or three councils. Local authorities can choose which band they wish to set for their local criteria, and Bradford has the legal power to change its eligibility criteria, as long as it consults its local community.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/3">People continue to tell us, however, that the process for determining who is eligible for care and support is confusing and unfair. Decisions are not transparent and there is variation across the country, and the end result is that people can be left without the support that they need. The existing assessment and eligibility framework is therefore not working effectively, and that is widely recognised. That is why we are introducing a national minimum threshold for eligibility through the Care Bill. The Bill will set out the eligibility criteria&#8212;the point at which local authorities must meet an adult&#8217;s care and support needs, or a carer&#8217;s support needs. Local authorities will remain able to meet lower needs locally, if they choose to do so.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/4">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-06-28">28 June</phrase>, we published a set of draft regulations that set out the national eligibility criteria. These are intended to describe an equivalent level to the &#8220;substantial&#8221; level used by the vast majority of councils. We have committed to providing funding that will maintain the same level of services when authorities move to the new system in April 2015. This is the beginning of engagement with stakeholders before we formally consult on the</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/5">regulations next spring. I assure my hon. Friend that the setting of the threshold is about establishing a minimum standard, not taking away councils&#8217; discretion to go further. Of course, the more preventive care that can be given, the better, because that improves well-being and ultimately reduces the cost to the system, which is exactly the point that he made.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/6">Under the current spending review, local authorities should be able to protect access to care, but we know that not all the money that was earmarked for care services has been spent in that way. Ultimately, spending on social care is a matter for local people in local authorities, and councils such as Bradford have to make tough decisions. However, we cannot improve care and support simply by throwing ever more money into the system; on the contrary, we need to work in more innovative and effective ways, exactly as is happening in Bradford, where there is really impressive work on dementia-friendly communities. That is exactly the sort of collaboration that we need to encourage.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/7">Local authorities across the country have already been redesigning services to find more efficient ways of working. For example, many local authorities are concentrating on better integration between health and care services, improving co-operation and reducing duplication. That means better use of money, and improved care.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/8">My hon. Friend referred to this year&#8217;s spending review settlement. It includes a &#163;3.8 billion pooled health and social care budget to make sure that everyone gets a proper, joined-up service, and the care that they need from whoever is best placed to deliver, whether that is the NHS or the local authority. The &#163;3.8 billion fund, shared between the NHS and local authorities, will deliver integrated services more efficiently for older people and, crucially, disabled people. It covers ensuring that health and social care work together to improve outcomes for local people, through better sharing of information, so that people need explain their problems only once; intervening early, so that older and disabled people can stay healthy and independent at home, avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions and reducing visits to accident and emergency departments; and delivering care that is centred on the individual, rather than on what the system wants to provide. Examples include NHS and social care staff working together to provide seven-day working, and better data-sharing to ensure that people can leave hospital as soon as they are ready.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/9">The Care Bill includes a duty to provide preventive services; that is exactly the sort of thing that my hon. Friend is advocating for Bradford. That new duty on local authorities is seen by many people as potentially transformative. The White Paper sets out our ambition for health care and support to be organised around the needs of the service user, rather than focusing on organisations and services. We want a reformed system, in which organisations work together to give individuals</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/10">real control and choice over the care that they receive. Good practice already exists, and we need to learn from and build on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/11">I understand that Bradford&#8217;s clinical commissioning groups are working with Bradford council to deliver a three-year integration programme, which will cover all the services that help to support people so that they can remain at home, stay in their community, and regain and retain their health, well-being and independence. We want to encourage and support local experimentation, to allow areas to provide integrated care at scale and pace. We are working to support local initiatives and to identify what needs to happen to drive change at the national level. We want to learn what works well and how to overcome barriers, and to pass those lessons on to others.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2013-05-14">14 May</phrase>, the national partners in health care and support, including the Department, published a document entitled &#8220;Integrated Care and Support: Our Shared Commitment&#8221;, which sets out 10 commitments that the national partners have made to enable and encourage change at scale and pace, as well as expectations on local areas in return. The national partners have invited the most ambitious areas to apply to become pioneers and act as exemplars to address local barriers and support the rapid dissemination, promotion and uptake of lessons across the country. The national partners will provide the pioneer sites with dedicated central support to help them to break down barriers to delivering integrated care and support.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/13">It is really exciting that the coalition is acting to end that long, historical divide between health and care services and, indeed, between mental and physical health services. The potential for integrated care, with a focus on prevention, and collaboration between the statutory services provided by the national health service and the local authority and the community, exactly as is happening in Bradford, can provide the early intervention that my hon. Friend discussed and it can address isolation. He mentioned that pernicious problem. Many people live on their own, and often lead lonely lives and, as he said, and both their mental and physical health deteriorates. If we can get the community to support the statutory services, providing companionship and friendship, and giving people a better life, the combination of that with a much more joined-up service from the statutory services can achieve the breakthrough that he described in his community.</p>
	<p pid="c.152.1/14">I conclude by applauding the impressive community work in Bradford, which began in one local community, but which has the potential to spread to 20 other local communities. That is exactly what should be done, and with the support of the Care Bill, we can make that a reality, not only in Bradford but across the country.</p>
