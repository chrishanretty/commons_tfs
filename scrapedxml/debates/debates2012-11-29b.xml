	<p pid="b.351.5/1">The coalition Government is working hard to promote cycling and make it even safer. Yesterday I announced a further &#163;20 million of funding for cycling projects. This is on top of the &#163;30 million of funding announced earlier this year to tackle dangerous junctions. We have also made it simpler for councils to put in place 20 mph zones and limits and install Trixi mirrors to improve the visibility of cyclists at junctions, by reducing bureaucracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.351.6/1">I am grateful to the Minister for that detailed reply. I recently met representatives of the Leicester cycling campaign, who made it clear that they felt that, if I may say so, the Government need to put more emphasis on and more support into cycling. Given that, will the Government commit to implement all the proposals of the Cities Fit for Cycling campaign and invest in dedicated separate cycling infrastructure?</p>

	<p pid="b.351.7/1">That, if I may say so, is a churlish interpretation of what the Government has done, which is to put enormous effort into improving cycling and progressing all the recommendations of <i>The Times</i> Cities Fit for Cycling campaign, which I very much welcome. It is perhaps worth noting that there was a huge backlog of important cycling interventions that we inherited when we took office and we are progressing well to deal with those.</p>

	<p pid="b.352.9/1">Along with many other members of the Government, I offer my deepest sympathy to those who have been affected by the recent flooding.

We have taken a range of measures, as have the companies that produce cars. There is no doubt that cars are much more responsive in their braking power than they were 30 years ago.

	<p pid="b.358.3/1">At a time of budget constraints, agencies understandably concentrate scarce resources on the performance targets against which they are measured. That is clearly having an impact on road safety budgets. I urge the Secretary of State to reconsider this decision because quite apart from the personal tragedy that is involved in all fatalities, it is a false economy, because every fatality costs a lot of money.</p>

	<p pid="b.359.0/1">The Secretary of State&#8217;s decision will be bitterly regretted by campaign groups across the country. Targets introduced by the Thatcher Administration 30 years ago had cross-party support and have successfully brought down casualty rates across the country. His use of the word &#8220;forecasts&#8221; indicates that he is trying to claw something back from his predecessor&#8217;s bad decision to abolish targets. Will the Secretary of State think again? Targets are not the whole solution but a component; they are part of the way to reduce serious injuries and deaths on British roads.</p>

	<p pid="b.369.10/1">Access to internet television and radio services in Members&#8217; offices may be limited by the capacity of the parliamentary network. Planning for a major upgrade has started, but this is likely to be a long-term project. The annunciator system provides alternative access to television and radio service in</p>

Wi-fi is already in place in 95 locations across the estate, including the Chamber, Committee Rooms and public spaces. It should be available in Members&#8217; offices by March 2013.</p>

	<p pid="b.370.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for that answer. Although I welcome having channels such as al-Jazeera to keep up to date with international affairs and having access to Sky Sports in my office, I would certainly like to have access to my local BBC regional news, BBC Humberside. I am sure the hon. Gentleman agrees that keeping up to date with what is happening in a Member&#8217;s local area is just as important, if not more so, than having access to al-Jazeera and other channels.</p>

I miss BBC Radio Highland and Moray Firth Radio when I am down here in the south, and would greatly value the opportunity to receive them.

I pointed out recently that questions from my right hon. Friend the shadow Secretary of State had still not been answered by the Secretary of State. Will the Leader of the House look into the matter? It appears to be something of a problem in the Home Office. How can the Opposition be expected to work properly if they cannot hold the Government to account?

The Procedure Committee is following that up, and I shall be working with Departments to try to improve their performance. I might point out that in the last Session a 100% positive response rate was achieved by the Office of the Leader of the House, and, as I said earlier, the Department of Health achieved a 99.6% rate.</p>

	<p pid="b.373.3/1">I thank the Leader of the House for announcing the business for next week.</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/2">The flooding across England and Wales this week has caused widespread chaos and, sadly, a number of deaths. I would like to add my tribute on the work of the emergency services and all those involved in providing assistance to those affected.</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/3">The increasing frequency of serious weather affecting the UK underlines the importance of robust flood defences, yet spending on flood defences has been cut by a quarter, delaying much-needed schemes. Even the Government&#8217;s own advisory Committee on Climate Change warned in July that Ministers are not doing enough, and now hundreds of thousands of people risk being unable to obtain insurance because the Government have not reached an agreement with the industry. We welcome the statement earlier in the week from the Environment Secretary, but will the Leader of the House find time for an urgent debate on measures to protect people across the UK from flooding, especially in light of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee report published today?</p>

	<p pid="b.373.3/5">last week I also raised the matter of the Liberal Democrat party member who masqueraded as an independent in the police and crime commissioner elections. I asked for an urgent statement, but unfortunately the Leader of the House has not been able to find time for one. I wonder whether he will reconsider, however, because I have managed to get hold of a letter put out by the Liberal Democrat candidate standing in today&#8217;s Middlesbrough by-election. In it he says,</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/6">&#8220;things seem to be getting worse, not better.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/7">I have read the letter very carefully, but, by some strange omission, nowhere does it mention that the Liberal Democrats have been in government for the last two and a half years, so will the Leader of the House now find time for a statement on cynical electoral subterfuge?</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/8">We are all looking forward to the publication of the Leveson report later today. During business questions on <phrase class="date" code="2012-06-28">28 June</phrase>, I asked:</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/9">&#8220;Will the Leader of the House arrange in future business for Liberal Democrat and Conservative Ministers to share the speaking time to give both parties ample opportunity to differentiate themselves?&#8221;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2012-06-28.448"><i>Official Report</i>, 28 June 2012; Vol. 547, c. 448</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/10">I must confess that I meant that suggestion to be parody, but yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister made a request to have a separate statement from the Prime Minister on the Leveson report and I see today that that has been granted. What on earth is happening to collective responsibility? I notice that the play &#8220;Yes, Prime Minister&#8221; is leaving the Trafalgar theatre to go on a UK tour, but with this Government in office there will at least still be one farce running in Whitehall.</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/11">The Government have been struggling to get their legislation through the House of Lords. This Government&#8217;s peers easily outnumber Opposition peers, yet for the entire duration of the Labour Government our peers never made up more than 29% of the total. May I say to the Leader of the House that the problem the Government have is not with the quantity of their peers, it is with the quality of their legislation?</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/12">There have been reports in the media that the Prime Minister is planning to create 100 additional peers, despite the fact that the House of Lords is already the second biggest legislature in the world&#8212;after the equally democratic Chinese National People&#8217;s Congress. Filling the House of Lords might be the only successful job creation scheme this Government have come up with, but will the Leader of the House find time for an urgent statement on the seemingly inexorable expansion of the second Chamber?</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/13">Word reaches me that this week&#8217;s Cabinet meeting was even more fractious than usual. Apparently, the Chancellor blamed the Culture Secretary for failing to deliver on the Government&#8217;s promise to roll out superfast broadband and the Culture Secretary blamed her predecessor, with her aides saying that she had done more in two months than the current Health Secretary had managed in two years. Astonishingly, the welfare Minister, Lord Freud, blamed the Chancellor for the abject failure of the Work programme and the Prime Minister blamed the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government for the failure of enterprise zones. While Cabinet members bicker, we have a broadband network that is not connected, a job scheme that is not</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/14">working and enterprise zones where there is no enterprise, while the only growth strategy they have is for the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="b.373.3/15">The Prime Minister called himself the &#8220;heir to Blair&#8221;, but is he not just the natural successor to Jim Hacker?</p>

	<p pid="b.375.0/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for her remarks about the Foreign Secretary&#8217;s statement on Palestine. I join her in paying tribute to the emergency services and the work of Environment Agency staff in supporting communities that have been so heavily damaged by flooding. I have personal knowledge of the area around Exeter and of St Asaph in north Wales; these are dreadful events for people to have to live through.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.0/2">It is terrifically important that we protect people wherever we can. That is why the Government are allocating &#163;2.17 billion over four years. The hon. Lady will have heard the Prime Minister say yesterday, in response to questions, that we hope to leverage additional support for flood defences. She will also know from what the Prime Minister said yesterday that we continue to be in discussions with the Association of British Insurers about securing protection for householders through insurance as well. I will, of course, continue to keep closely in touch with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs about how the House can be kept informed on these matters.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.0/3">I am trying to think of anything else that the hon. Lady asked for that could be considered business of the House, but there was not much. She commented on press reports about what happened at Cabinet, but today of all days she might recognise that we should not believe everything we read in the newspapers.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.0/4">The hon. Lady mentioned the Prime Minister being an &#8220;heir to Blair&#8221;, and she talked about the appointment of peers in another place, but my recollection is that Tony Blair made 374 peers. By that standard, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has been notably reticent.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.0/5">We in the House, including Opposition Members who have been in government, know that &#8220;Yes Minister&#8221;, when it was broadcast by the BBC and even today, is, in fact, a documentary programme and not a work of fiction. I am somewhat unusual in this place in having been not only my own version of Jim Hacker, but Bernard in a former life. The one thing I am not expecting to be is a Sir Humphrey at any stage. If at any point we can illustrate &#8220;Yes Minister&#8221;, I am sure we will set out to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.375.0/6">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for talking about growth and welfare. Yesterday we had a debate about those issues. I looked at reports of past business questions for a request for an Opposition day debate on employment. Yesterday, the Opposition did talk about jobs but not about how to create them. They did not have a policy for that&#8212;it was a policy-free zone from the Labour party yesterday. What a missed opportunity. The Labour party had an opportunity to use its time to celebrate the 70-year anniversary of the Beveridge report. We could have celebrated the sense of how work is a route out of poverty and want, and how social solidarity through welfare provision is properly a way in which we can build a stronger society, as the Government are setting out to do. We could also have celebrated the contribution made by a Liberal as part of a coalition Government under a Conservative Prime Minister for the long-term benefit of this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.376.1/1">I pay tribute to the great deal of work my hon. Friend has done on this issue. As we head towards winter, it is terrifically important that we look after communities. That is one reason why I was so pleased in the past week to see the announcement of some 149 successful projects that are being supported by the Department of Health&#8217;s warm homes healthy people fund this winter, following the successful work last winter. This is in partnership with local authorities, Age UK and other charities, and I know that my hon.

	<p pid="b.376.2/1">In her excellent report last week, the Children&#8217;s Commissioner identified missing episodes, visits to sexual health clinics and use of mental health services as strong indicators that a child may be being sexually abused. However, current Department of Health guidelines on sharing such health data with other agencies are creating a postcode lottery because of different interpretations at both the local and national level about what data can be shared. The situation is very concerning because some children are not being identified as being at risk, and are therefore continuing to be abused. Will the Leader of the House make time available for a debate on the Children&#8217;s Commissioner&#8217;s excellent report and the data-sharing issues it raises?</p>

	<p pid="b.376.3/1">I am grateful to the hon. Lady for raising that. I read the report, as I know many hon. Members will have done. They will have been alarmed by some of the things that the deputy Children&#8217;s Commissioner had to say and will feel it is very important that we follow up on it. The House recently had an opportunity to debate child sexual exploitation, but that is not to say that there is not a case for further such opportunities. The subject she discusses is an area where the further progress we are making on the role of local safeguarding children boards in local authorities should enable us to have, among other things, better sharing of information to protect children.</p>

May we have a debate about what we would lose if childhood was shrunk by giving children&#8212;16-year-olds&#8212;the vote?

In my constituency, the I-Foundation has opened the first state-sponsored Hindu primary school and a secondary school. They are both so over-subscribed that capacity is having to be doubled in just two years. The I-Foundation is now launching a campaign to have five further Hindu free schools across the country, with a further five to follow. This demonstrates parental choice, both for a religious type of education and for the type of education that new organisations are providing.</p>

She has only a &#163;6,000 a year scholarship to live off and is deeply worried that she will have to give up her studies because she is struggling to get by. May we have a statement on what steps the Government will take to provide proper support to wonderful carers like Jo, who are both full-time students and full-time carers?</p>

Carer&#8217;s allowance is intended to be an allowance in relation to the loss of potential for earnings. If somebody is in full-time education, by definition one cannot justify carer&#8217;s allowance to that extent. On support for carers generally, the House has just agreed the establishment of a Joint Committee to consider the draft Care and Support Bill, which includes the most important legislative measures ever presented to give a basis of support for carers.</p>

May we have a debate about apprenticeships so that all MPs across the House can cite innovative examples from their constituencies and discuss the Government&#8217;s progress in this area?</p>

	<p pid="b.384.1/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend. Today, not least, it is good to have a different reference to hacking&#8212;in this case in relation to butchery. That example shows how apprenticeships are being made available in small and medium-sized businesses, and is a signal of how we can create jobs in the future. In the past, jobs have come overwhelmingly from small and medium-sized businesses and from growing businesses. If apprentices are able to find such places, they will be able to secure the jobs of the future. That is why it is encouraging that 950,000 apprenticeships have started in the past two years with 100,000 employers in 160,000 locations. I hope that what my hon. Friend describes is just one of many such schemes that we will be able to support.</p>

	<p pid="b.387.1/1">Mr Speaker, I am grateful to you and the House for your patience.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/2">I am pleased, ahead of the Energy Bill&#8217;s introduction later today, to publish the annual energy statement. It shows that this Government are making good progress towards our vision of a thriving low-carbon economy with secure energy supplies, and sets out an energy policy that is good for growth and for consumers. Alongside the annual energy statement, I am publishing our energy security strategy, the statutory security of supply report, a consultation on electricity demand reduction, and more detail on electricity market reform. I am today laying copies of all those documents before the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/3">Britain&#8217;s energy sector is embarking on a period of exceptional renewal and expansion. The scale of the investment required is huge, representing close to half the UK&#8217;s total infrastructure investment pipeline. The electricity sector alone needs investment of around &#163;110 billion in the next decade&#8212;that is equivalent to building Crossrail seven times over&#8212;but the vast majority of it will not be taxpayers&#8217; money, with Government subsidies targeted at levering in private sector investment in low-carbon energy, so our plans are consistent with our overriding goal of deficit reduction.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/4">The energy sector can play a major role in stimulating economic growth, creating jobs and positioning British companies for success in export markets. One third of the UK&#8217;s economic growth in the last financial year is likely to have come from green business, and the UK&#8217;s low-carbon sector now takes a &#163;122 billion share of a global market worth &#163;3.3 trillion. Many projects are shovel-ready, and they are spread relatively evenly through every nation and region of the UK, so the stimulus to the economy and to supply chains, and the job creation, can come at the right time, which is now, and in the right place, which is nationwide.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/5">Those short-term benefits of our transition to a low-carbon future are followed by still greater ones in the longer term. First, of course, our transition will help us to meet our carbon budgets on the path to our 2050 emissions target, so that Britain will continue to play a leading role in tackling climate change. Secondly, it will diversify our energy mix, improving our energy security, and insulating households and business consumers from high and volatile fossil fuel prices on global markets. Thirdly, it will keep British companies at the forefront of the fast-growing global green sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/6">However, investment on the scale needed will not happen under the current framework. Industry and investors have told the Government very clearly that we must play our part, by creating a regulatory framework against which they can invest, and by giving clarity on the level of incentives available. We cannot afford to miss this opportunity. We need those shovel-ready projects to get under way now, and the energy security challenge we face is real, with fossil fuel imports set to increase, electricity demand to rise, and around a fifth of our existing power plant to close by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/7">We therefore propose nothing less than the biggest transformation of Britain&#8217;s electricity market since privatisation. That follows agreement across the coalition,</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/8">not only on electricity market reform and the Energy Bill, but on a real-terms tripling of the budget for support for low-carbon generation.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/9">We need to improve revenue certainty for investors in low-carbon generation, including renewables, nuclear power, and carbon capture and storage, so we will take powers in the Energy Bill to introduce feed-in tariffs with contracts for difference. That mechanism will give investors precisely the confidence they seek. We have also responded to Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change concerns and will create a single counter-party for the contracts for difference.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/10">We will also introduce a capacity market to ensure that there is sufficient gas generation to provide the back-up and flexibility we will need. Gas remains a vital part of our energy mix, and we will support the exploitation of unconventional gas resources where it is economic and can be carried out with full protection of the environment. Our gas generation strategy will be published alongside the autumn statement of my right hon. Friend the Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/11">We will legislate to allow the Government in the next Parliament to set a 2030 decarbonisation target for the power sector, and in the shorter term we will introduce an emissions performance standard. That will ensure that new coal plant can be built only with carbon capture and storage technology. All those mechanisms will be supported by a robust, transparent institutional framework. The reforms will maintain Britain&#8217;s energy security while providing a huge opportunity for jobs and growth. Competition for long-term contracts will drive innovation, raise productivity and give UK industries a strong platform from which to compete internationally.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/12">Consumer bills are one of my greatest concerns. They have been driven up remorselessly by wholesale fossil fuel prices: global gas prices were 50% higher in the five years to 2011 than in the previous five years, and they have continued to rise in the past year. High energy bills can put huge pressure on households and businesses, so let me be very clear, especially given recent misleading reports in the media: Government policy is designed specifically to reduce consumer bills. Of course, we cannot control global commodity markets. However, we can and will put consumers in control by driving a wedge between wholesale energy prices and consumer bills. That is why we propose to legislate in the Energy Bill to ensure that consumers are placed on the cheapest tariff that meets their preferences.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/13">We can and will diversify our energy supplies: our policies stand to reduce the UK&#8217;s sensitivity to fossil fuel price spikes by approximately 30% by 2020, and by around 60% by 2050. We can and will push energy companies to make switching easier and quicker&#8212;households can already save up to &#163;200 per year simply by switching provider. We can and will pursue savings wherever we can find them in the energy system&#8212;for example, up to &#163;3.5 billion from offshore transmission co-ordination. We can and will continue to place energy efficiency front and centre. More than 2 million insulation measures were installed in the year to June 2012. The savings are considerable: the 500,000 households who insulated their cavity walls in 2011 are each saving approximately &#163;135 per year. Last month, we put in place the framework for the green deal, which allows households and businesses to install energy efficiency measures without any upfront cost, and to pay for them through the savings on their energy bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/14">If we look ahead to energy bills in 2020, we see that energy efficiency savings are set to outweigh&#8212;more than outweigh&#8212;the cost of supporting low-carbon electricity generation. The net effect of Government policies on energy bills is downwards, not upwards. Of course, vulnerable households need our help now, and they are getting it. More than 1 million low-income pensioners will get &#163;130 off their fuel bills this winter, and all pensioner households will get a winter fuel payment of &#163;200, or &#163;300 for those over 80 years old. Energy suppliers provided approximately &#163;250 million of support under the warm home discount scheme in 2011-12, assisting about 2 million low-income and vulnerable households. The new energy company obligation will channel &#163;540 million-worth of green deal investment per year, reaching approximately 270,000 vulnerable and low-income households and those living in harder-to-treat properties by 2015. To help people better manage their own energy use, we will be rolling out smart meters across Great Britain: 53 million new meters will be installed by 2019, delivering an estimated &#163;7.2 billion in net benefits to the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/15">The heated debate on energy policy can sometimes obscure what is in many ways a great success story for our country. The UK already leads the world in offshore wind, and we are on track to meet our renewables targets. Energy investment in Britain is running at a 20-year high, according to Energy UK. We have the world&#8217;s first renewable heat incentive. This year&#8217;s offshore oil and gas licensing round received the highest number of applications since licensing began in 1964. Our carbon capture and storage offer, including the &#163;1 billion commercialisation competition, is one of the world&#8217;s most comprehensive.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/16">We continue to make progress in international talks on climate change. I will shortly be attending the C0P 18 talks in Doha, working towards the genuinely global deal to which Durban opened the door, to be agreed by 2015 and to come into force from 2020. We are now preparing a once in a generation transformation of the energy landscape to bring on massive private-sector investment, which will boost the economy, create jobs, and power Britain towards a prosperous low-carbon future.</p>
	<p pid="b.387.1/17">The Government&#8217;s energy policy is good for the British economy, good for consumers and good for the planet, and I commend the statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.389.0/1">I thank the Secretary of State for early notice of his statement. I was going to say that I felt deprived at not getting two statements&#8212;one from the Secretary of State and one from the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40547" name="John Hayes">the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr Hayes)</phrase>&#8212;because that seems to be the usual manner of doing things this afternoon, but I think we were lucky just to get one. The Secretary of State can catch his breath now.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/2">I have always made it clear that where we can work with the Government in the national interest, we will do so. In that vein, the Secretary of State will know that we have supported the Government&#8217;s efforts to attract investment in new nuclear, and we welcome Hitachi&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/3">decision to buy the Horizon nuclear project. We also welcome the progress made in Durban last year and wish our negotiators in Doha well. It is with genuine regret, however, that over the past year we have seen the Government lurch from one crisis to another on many aspects of energy policy, from the disastrous handling of the cuts to the feed-in tariff for solar power, to the recent outburst on wind power from the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, the hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings, and, I am afraid, the Prime Minister&#8217;s broken promises on energy bills. The Department has done more than its fair share to get the word &#8220;omnishambles&#8221; in the &#8220;Oxford English Dictionary&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/4">Today, alongside the statement, the Secretary of State is also publishing the Government&#8217;s long-awaited Energy Bill. His Department&#8217;s press notice helpfully reminds us that the Bill has faced repeated delays, which I believe has undermined confidence and left much investment in limbo. We will of course look carefully at the Bill and the other proposals the Government have published today on demand reduction, energy security and energy-intensive industries, and I look forward to debating them more fully with the Secretary of State in due course.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/5">I want to pick up on two aspects of the Secretary of State&#8217;s announcement and ask him some specific questions: first, on the state of competition in the energy market and, secondly, on the Government&#8217;s failure to set a clear target to decarbonise the power sector. This time last year, when the Secretary of State&#8217;s predecessor delivered the annual energy statement, he said that people&#8217;s bills would be lower during this Parliament. Families and businesses up and down the country that have seen their bills rise by more than &#163;250 know that that is just not true. In response, the Government launched their &#8220;click, switch and insulate to save&#8221; campaign, but the number of people switching suppliers fell to record lows.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/6">The Secretary of State talked about energy efficiency, but next year this Administration will become the first since the 1970s not to have a Government-funded energy efficiency scheme. The Prime Minister told the House that he would force the energy companies by law to put everyone on the lowest tariff, but it turned out that all the Government are really doing is limiting the number of tariffs those companies can offer. The simple truth is that even the lowest tariff in an uncompetitive market will not be a good deal.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/7">The Secretary of State says that the burden of investment will not fall on taxpayers, but it will fall on bill payers, and, at a time when we are asking them to pay for as much as &#163;200 billion of investment in our energy infrastructure, it is more important than ever that we have an energy market that delivers fair prices and works in the public interest. For too long, the big energy companies have been able to get away with what they want at the expense of everyone else. Those big companies dominate 98% of the market and, decades after privatisation, still have a virtual monopoly in their former electricity regions. They tell us that electricity and gas prices in the UK are among the lowest in Europe, but when tax is taken out of the equation, they are among the highest. Most damning of all, whenever these companies announce their price hikes, they tell us they are only passing on their costs, so why is it that when those costs come down, consumers rarely see the savings?</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/8">Whether or not the allegations of price fixing in the gas market turn out to be true, they clearly show that the market is not transparent enough. Let me, then, ask the Secretary of State three very straightforward questions: first, does he believe that there is effective competition in either the wholesale or the retail energy market? Secondly, whether consumers get a fair deal will largely depend on the strike price the Government set for contracts for difference and the reference price in the market at the time, but if the market is structured in such a way that no one knows what the true cost of energy actually is, how will the Government even be able to set a robust strike price? Thirdly, given that the proposals were originally called &#8220;electricity market reform&#8221;, why does the new Bill fail to make proposals on how energy is bought and sold in order to make it more open, more transparent and more competitive?</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/9">This morning, I looked through the &#8220;Electricity market reform: policy overview&#8221; document. In paragraph 101, there is an indication that the Government are perhaps beginning to recognise that greater competition is necessary, in its reference to</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/10">&#8220;Powers for the Secretary of State to make changes to electricity generation and supply licences conditions&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/11">That is quite interesting. Does it indicate that the Secretary of State is moving closer to some of the more radical suggestions for reforming the market which Labour has been putting forward for the past two years and which were referred to in our 2010 manifesto?</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/12">The Secretary of State said that investment was running at a 20-year high, but independent figures produced by Bloomberg New Energy Finance show that since this Government came to power, investment in renewable energy has fallen by more than half. He also said that the UK led the world in offshore wind, but figures out just today from Ernst and Young on renewable energy attractiveness show that, for the first time ever, the UK has been knocked off the top spot for offshore wind attractiveness and is now behind Germany. The reason that has happened is the uncertainty the Government have created. That is why firms have put investment on hold or scrapped it altogether.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/13">In June, Vestas abandoned its plans to create a new manufacturing plant in Kent, which would have created 2,000 jobs. What did the local Member of Parliament, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40556" name="Laura Sandys">the hon. Member for South Thanet (Laura Sandys)</phrase>, who is now Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40077" name="Gregory Barker">the right hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)</phrase>, say at the time? She said that Vestas&#8217; decision</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/14">&#8220;suggests a lack of confidence within the industry over the government&#8217;s commitment to the green economy and crucially, offshore wind. The market needs certainty from government if it is to deliver the thousands of jobs and billions of pounds of investment that could secure our economic recovery.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/15">Whether onshore or offshore, the business of firms such as Vestas is wind. What they wanted more than anything else in the Bill was a clear commitment to decarbonise the power sector by 2030. Just this morning, its chief executive told <i>The </i> <i>Guardian</i>:</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/16">&#8220;The failure to establish a firm 2030 power sector carbon cap prolongs uncertainty.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/17">In his words,</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/18">&#8220;This is a significant missed opportunity,&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/19">and he is not alone in thinking that.</p>
	<p pid="b.389.0/20">It is not just businesses in the renewables sector but those elsewhere that are concerned about the Government&#8217;s lack of vision. I make no bones about it: we support a clear decarbonisation target in the Bill&#8212;and from what I read in this morning&#8217;s papers, so do many hon. Members on the Government Benches, including the Chair of the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change. When the time comes, we will work with colleagues across the House to put a decarbonisation target in the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-29b.392.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40343" speakername="Edward Davey" colnum="392"  time="011:29:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121129/debtext/121129-0002.htm#12112958002052">
	<p pid="b.392.0/1">I am grateful for the right hon. Lady&#8217;s initial remarks. I am delighted that she wants to work with the Government to attract investment and that she wishes us well in the Doha talks next week. I hope we can reach a cross-party consensus on some of these important measures to tackle climate change, which is incredibly important. Both coalition parties gave that support to the last Government, for their Climate Change Act 2008, and I hope we can continue that consensus.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/2">The right hon. Lady said that the Bill had been delayed. Ever since I have been Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, I have said it would be published in November and it has been. We are on time and on track. She asked a number of questions, but gave no recognition to the fact that two parties that have had their disagreements have come together with an energy policy. She also failed to mention how that has been received by industry and the investor community. The director general of the CBI, John Cridland, gave a ringing endorsement to the policies that we have announced, after the discussions I had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That political certainty, backed with the policy certainty of today&#8217;s announcement, will bring the billions of pounds of investment into the UK that our economy and our energy infrastructure needs.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/3">The right hon. Lady asked me about competition. One almost thinks that she is suffering from amnesia, because it was the previous Government who failed to tackle competition. We are determined to tackle it, but we will not be using ideas from the Labour party&#8217;s manifesto, because we have our own ideas on how to ensure competition in the retail sector, with our arguments about switching, and in the wholesale sector, with our arguments about greater liquidity and transparency in that market. Of course we have competitive markets, but they could be more competitive. We are determined to drive them further and faster, and our policies will do far more than the ones she is offering the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/4">The right hon. Lady questioned our new policies on tariffs, which will simplify them in a way that I believe will drive competition. Time and again, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> asked the previous Government to simplify tariffs, to drive competition in the consumer&#8217;s interest, and what did they do? Absolutely nothing. We will take no lessons from her on that matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/5">The right hon. Lady asked about strike prices. She does not seem to understand how they will be set, so let me explain, although we will no doubt do this on Second Reading of the Bill. They will be set administratively until 2017; then they will be set through auctions. Auctions are the way to get the real transparency and competition that the previous Government failed to deliver.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/6">The right hon. Lady asked about the decarbonisation target. That has been a matter of some debate within the Government, and there will no doubt be a debate on</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/7">it between Members on both sides during the passage of the Bill. I looked at the 2010 manifestos of all the parties&#8212;the Green party, the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives&#8212;to see what promises they had made on a decarbonisation target for the power sector. None of us had made any. There were no such promises in the coalition agreement either, but since becoming Secretary of State, I have gone into the discussions determined to make that argument. I have done so, and we will table amendments to the Bill to give the Secretary of State power to set a decarbonisation target. I am proud of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.392.0/8">The right hon. Lady said that without a decarbonisation target, we would see no investment in the supply chain. I simply refer her to Arriva&#8217;s announcement last week on a turbine factory. The weeks and months ahead will show whether we will see that supply chain investment. I believe that we will, because this coalition Government have put the right policies in place.</p>

	<p pid="b.393.0/1">Lord Stern, whose discredited report still forms the rationale for the Government&#8217;s energy policy, calculated in 2006 the amount by which the price of hydrocarbons needed to be increased in order to decarbonise the economy. Since then, the price of hydrocarbons has risen faster and further than either Lord Stern or the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change thought sufficient, so why does my right hon. Friend propose to pile Pelion upon Ossa by burdening British industry and households with these tripled taxes?</p>

	<p pid="b.393.1/1">My right hon. Friend has been consistent: he voted against the Climate Change Act 2008 and he clearly does not like our low-carbon policies today. The fact that fossil fuel prices have gone up is yet another argument for our policies. We need to insulate our economy, our consumers and our businesses from those high prices. This country has to import far more fossil fuels than we used to because North sea resources are going down, and that is leaving our economy exposed. We need to tackle that issue for reasons of energy security and to ensure that we have competitive prices.</p>

	<p pid="b.393.2/1">The Secretary of State is obviously very pleased with himself about the tariffs, but will he acknowledge that he has failed to deliver what the Prime Minister promised, which was to put everybody on the lowest tariff? Given that he has not done that, will he consider making a concession to over-75-year-olds, who could save &#163;200 a year by being on the lowest tariff? The 3,500 pensioners in my constituency would greatly appreciate that.</p>

	<p pid="b.393.3/1">First, we want to give the benefits of switching to everybody, not just to pensioners. Hard-working families are struggling, and we want to ensure that they get the benefits as well. As for the Prime Minister&#8217;s commitment to get people on to the cheapest tariffs, we are delivering that. Ofgem&#8217;s retail market review of the four core tariffs will ensure that people who are on stranded or dead tariffs will automatically be switched to the lowest tariff, given their preferences. I would have thought that the Opposition would want to ensure that people are on the lowest tariff, because it</p>
	<p pid="b.393.3/2">will bring them big savings and ensure that their preferences &#8212;whether on payment or other things&#8212;are recognised. That is the best of both worlds.</p>

	<p pid="b.394.0/1">The Secretary of State mentioned the important role that he sees gas still playing in the transition to the low-carbon economy. Will he give me an assurance that the record licensing round that he has just announced is an indication of the Government&#8217;s continued commitment to maximising the remaining potential of our North sea assets?</p>

	<p pid="b.394.1/1">Yes, I can give my hon. Friend that assurance. Sometimes the debate is characterised as a choice between gas and renewables, but we need both. That is particularly important as coal-fired power stations go off line. The gas power stations that replace them will help to cut our carbon emissions. It is absolutely right for our country&#8217;s energy security and prosperity that we maximise the potential of the North sea and, indeed, the other offshore fields, particularly those west of Shetland, and we will do that.</p>

	<p pid="b.394.3/1">Right hon. and hon. Members will know there has been a competition to secure the support that the Government offer for carbon capture and storage.

As he knows, I think Scotland is stronger in the United Kingdom and that the United Kingdom is stronger with Scotland in it, not least on energy policy. On CCS, we are pursuing our policies as quickly as we can, but we need to make sure that we get value for money for the taxpayer. We were fortunate to have eight applications; we have now whittled that down to four, and we are proceeding apace to choose between those remaining four. It is true that we did not get in the first round of the New Entrants Reserve 300 funding from the EU, but we are wholly able to get into the second round and get the same amount of money. I have spoken to the European Commissioner about that. I see no problem in ensuring that we use the money put aside to get the best value for money for the best CCS projects.</p>

This is not a new issue arising from green energy; it has been an issue for many decades. The Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, my hon.

It was ignored for far too long, but we are not going to ignore it. One of our reasons for arranging the consultation was that, although Ofgem could proceed with its own work and change licence conditions relating to bills and what is on them, we wanted to provide a statutory underpinning&#8212;a back-stop&#8212;to ensure that the process took place as quickly and smoothly as possible.

On our objectives, we have been arguing for a balanced package. In the pre-COP discussions in Seoul, we argued that the European Union and other members of the Kyoto protocol need to commit to a second period and that we need the long-term co-operative action negotiations to come to an end, and in return we need a work plan to take us from now until 2015 so that we can implement the international, legally binding treaty promised at Durban. In addition, we want ambitious proposals to come from other countries on climate change finance and we would like to see more mitigation measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.400.3/2">Just before this statement, I was at Clarence house with His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales attending a meeting on forests. We have made an announcement today of the use of UK climate change finance money to support new forest projects, which I believe will help the climate change talks and show that this Government have an ambitious agenda.</p>

I am sure that my hon. Friend would understand that, given our close partnership with Germany, I would not wish to tread on Herr Altmaier&#8217;s toes, but this country is investing in nuclear. We are putting forward a regime that we think is attractive, and Hitachi&#8217;s &#163;700 million investment in the Horizon project shows that international companies and international capital believe we have got it right.</p>

	<p pid="b.402.3/1">First, on my hon. Friend&#8217;s last point, I have made it clear that we will be very transparent about negotiations with EDF or any other company. Of course, he would not expect me to comment on negotiations daily but he would expect me to bring to the House the results of them so that I can be held to account in the proper way.</p>
	<p pid="b.402.3/2">On my hon. Friend&#8217;s first point, he is absolutely right. One of the huge advantages of feed-in tariffs with contracts for difference compared with the renewable obligations certificate system is that the deal is much better for consumers. The policies we are putting in place and electricity market reform will mean that consumer and business bills will be far lower than they otherwise would have been. That is one of the main reasons we are doing this.</p>

	<p pid="b.405.3/3">It is customary to begin debates that are granted by the Backbench Business Committee by saying how pleased we are to have a debate on a particular subject. I say that genuinely, not merely as a convention. Tomorrow is St Andrew&#8217;s day and Scots around the world are celebrating their pride in their nation and their culture. It is important when we are considering the future of Scotland and our United Kingdom that the debate takes place in this United Kingdom Parliament. We appreciate that the debate will take place in many forums around the United Kingdom and around the world over the next two years and particularly, of course, in Scotland and in the Scottish Parliament, but in addition to those debates, we must have the opportunity to discuss these extremely important matters here in the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>

Indeed, several of my constituents in Epping Forest have written to me or come to see me to ask why they, as Scots, will not get a vote in the referendum about the future of their country. I have told them not to worry, because as long as they keep on voting Conservative in Epping Forest there will be a Scottish voice here in the United Kingdom Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="b.406.4/2">Yesterday, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland led the annual St Andrew&#8217;s day service in the crypt of the Palace of Westminster. He asked why the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland comes to London in this week every year and he answered that question by saying that at least 300,000 Scots live in London. London is probably the largest parish covered by the Church of Scotland anywhere. That emphasises the point: there are Scots in London, in England and all over the world who care about the future of their country&#8212;our country. The Moderator of the General Assembly comes to London because this is the capital city of the United Kingdom&#8212;the capital city of all our nations brought together.</p>

On the numerous visits that I made to Iraq and Afghanistan, our armed forces did not ask one another whether they came from Cardiff, Belfast, Edinburgh or London.

	<p pid="b.407.5/1">No one is suggesting that history stands still. I am referring to history as history. What happened 100 years ago we will commemorate as having happened 100 years ago, but we will not forget it. Those who forget history suffer for having done so. The point made by my right hon. Friend the Member for North Somerset is that right now, at this very minute, brave servicemen and women from Scotland, England and other parts of the United Kingdom are fighting together to guarantee the freedom of our country, our whole country. That is not history. That is current. It is right now.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.5/2">Last week or the week before last, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> will remember, we had a debate in Committee Room 14 organised by the Law Society of Scotland, a fine bunch of people. Before I took all those interventions, I was speaking about Scots outside Scotland. The Law Society of Scotland has an enormous number of members, of which I happen to be one, in London. Committee Room 14 was packed. We had a really good and lively debate but, despite his excellent speech, not one person</p>
	<p pid="b.407.5/3">in that Room voted to support the hon. Gentleman&#8212; not one, and I promise I had not invited them all personally.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.5/4">Continuing on the same theme, last night I attended another packed meeting held here in London, in Chelsea, by Friends of the Union. It was a great surprise to me to bump into the chairman of the Essex Conservatives, a very nice gentleman whom I see frequently in my constituency. I said something along the lines, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you cared, Adrian.&#8221; He explained to me in no uncertain terms that he and many of the other people who were there at that event for Friends of the Union had come of their own accord because they are fed up hearing that people in England and the rest of the United Kingdom do not care about Scotland. That is simply not true and it will be proved not to be true as this debate takes hold throughout the whole country. He said to me, and other people came and joined in the conversation, &#8220;We are here because we care about the United Kingdom and we care about Scotland as part of the United Kingdom.&#8221; They value the United Kingdom. They know that we are better together.</p>
	<p pid="b.407.5/5">As we consider the motion and the amendment, and as we seriously begin the debate in the country, let us at least try to get the language right. This debate is not about nationalism. Scotland is a nation. We are proud of our nation. I discovered earlier that it happens that tomorrow is the 140th anniversary of the first football international between Scotland and England.</p>

	<p pid="b.408.1/1">It was held in Glasgow and I am pleased to say it was a no-score draw. But the point about it is that one can have an international only if one has a nation. We all go to Murrayfield, Twickenham and the Millennium stadium and cheer on our national football, rugby and other teams, because each of the component parts of the United Kingdom is a nation. So let us stop arguing about whether Scotland is a nation. That is not a question. Scotland is a nation, as is England, Wales, Northern Ireland and so on.</p>
	<p pid="b.408.1/2">The debate is not about independence. That is another misnomer. Scotland is independent and is in charge of her own destiny. Scotland has and always has had her own institutions&#8212;the law, the education system, the Church. I speak as living proof as a graduate of Edinburgh university, a member of the Law Society of Scotland and a member of the Church of Scotland, but more important than that to me, I am a member of the Epping Forest Scottish Association. As the Member of Parliament for Epping Forest in the proud county of Essex, I have no conflict between my nationality as Scottish and British, and my constituents have no problem about having somebody represent their constituency who happens to have been born in another part of the United Kingdom. This is a time when people around the world are breaking down barriers and coming together. It is wrong to construct barriers that we do not need.</p>

	<p pid="b.409.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is totally wrong. This is not about an argument or a debate about the right of people living in Scotland to determine their future. We all agree that people in Scotland have the right to determine their future. I have just said that and I have said it many times in the House and in other places. Everyone accepts that. Scotland is a nation. Scotland is independent. Scotland holds Scotland&#8217;s future in its own hands.</p>
	<p pid="b.409.0/2">This debate is not about nationalism or independence; it is about separation. That is the word that should be used in debates in this Parliament, in the Scottish Parliament and in every forum across the country and further afield in the debate that will rage between now and the referendum in two years&#8217; time. This is about separation, not pride in our country or whether Scotland can survive on her own. Of course Scotland can survive on her own; she is a strong and capable country full of brilliant and talented people. This debate is about drawing artificial lines that we do not need.

	<p pid="b.409.2/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am afraid that I have taken many interventions, this being a debate, but I will conclude shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.409.2/2">I will leave it to others to talk about why separation would be bad for industry, financial institutions, the currency, the armed forces, family and culture. I will turn to the motion and the amendment tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40409" name="Angus Robertson">the hon. Member for Moray (Angus Robertson)</phrase>. I would be minded to accept the amendment were it not for the first few words, which propose leaving out the last three lines of the motion, which state that this House</p>
	<p pid="b.409.2/3">&#8220;notes that a referendum on separating Scotland from the rest of the UK will be held before the end of 2014; and believes that Scotland is better off as part of the UK and the rest of the UK is better off together with Scotland.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.409.2/4">I believe that the vast majority of Members will support our motion today. The amendment would leave out those lines and add</p>
	<p pid="b.409.2/5">&#8220;recognises that special relationships also endure with Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and other members of the Commonwealth as well as the Republic of Ireland and the United States; and believes that this will also be the case with Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom after the 2014 independence referendum.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.409.2/6">I entirely agree, because after the referendum nothing will change. The people of Scotland are sensible, forward-looking people and they will vote to stay better together within the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.409.2/7">Most states in the landmass of Europe and other parts of the world have to draw boundaries somewhere, but we do not have to do so because we have a natural</p>
	<p pid="b.409.2/8">boundary: our shores. This is but a small island, full of people in every part whose individual lives, past, present and future, are bound up with each other. Each part has its own identity, but this House will agree this afternoon that we are stronger and better to go forward together as one United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.410.2/1">I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of the debate, alongside <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40249" name="Eleanor Laing">the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing)</phrase>, whom I am delighted to follow. In a way, as a Scot who represents an English constituency, she epitomises what the motion is about: the rich blend of the best of all four corners of our land that has made the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the success story it so evidently is. There is no doubt that the United Kingdom is greater than the sum of its constituent parts. Although I might disagree with her politics, I have no doubt that we, as Scots, share a love of our country and want to see what is right and proper for its people and for future generations. It is also fitting that we are holding this debate on the eve of St Andrew&#8217;s day, the national occasion when we Scots come together to celebrate our patron saint and demonstrate our pride in all things Scottish.</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/2">As the motion states, Scotland has made a significant contribution to the United Kingdom over the 305 years of the Union, and it continues to do so. Indeed, our shared history goes back even further to the union of the Crowns in 1603, when a Scot, James VI, sat on the English throne as James I. He was the first of six monarchs in the Stuart line who ruled both England and Scotland, as well as Ireland, until the Glorious Revolution, and then again to 1714. In fact, it was Queen Anne, the last of the Stuart line, who became the first monarch of the political union of Britain.</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/3">With the Acts of Union in 1707, Scotland quickly took advantage of the abolition of trade tariffs with England and trade blossomed. The 18th century also saw the Scottish enlightenment, a period characterised by momentous intellectual and scientific accomplishments, so much so that Voltaire said:</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/4">&#8220;We look to Scotland for all our ideas of civilisation.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/5">With the advent of the Union, Scots took up positions of power in politics, the civil service, the Army and Navy, trade, economics, colonial enterprises and other areas across the emerging British empire. The historian Neil Davidson has observed:</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/6">&#8220;Far from being &#8216;peripheral&#8217; to the British economy, Scotland...lay at its core.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/7">Indeed, throughout the industrial revolution Scotland more than punched above its weight and became known across the world for its excellence in engineering, as typified by Clyde-built ships.</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/8">Through advancements in medicine and its inventive spirit, distinct banking system and contribution to art, literature and culture, Scotland has always added greatly beyond its shores. Even in times of adversity, the people of Scotland have not been wanting. During the first world war, despite Scotland having a population of</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/9">only 4.8 million, over half a million Scots went to the front. My purpose in touching, albeit briefly, on 300 years of Scottish history is to point out that many of our achievements and benefits were because of our place within the UK, not in spite of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/10">Scotland is linked intrinsically to the rest of the United Kingdom socially, politically and economically. The single market within the UK affords significant economic, trade and employment opportunities to people on both sides of the border. Our membership of the European Union, through the United Kingdom, provides a vast marketplace for Scottish exporters. Together we have a place at the top table of the European Council of Ministers and we are one of the G8 forum of the world&#8217;s largest economies and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, all of which allows us to wield unprecedented influence on the European and global stages. As a member of NATO, we have collectively benefited since the war from international security and defence co-operation on a grand scale.</p>
	<p pid="b.410.2/11">When it comes to the economy, Scotland has a very important relationship with the rest of the UK. Scotland benefits from access to a market comprising tens of millions of people within a single jurisdiction. Scots are employed by firms based in the rest of the UK, and people in the rest of the UK benefit from employment opportunities with Scottish-based companies. Indeed, in 2010 Scotland&#8217;s exports to the rest of the UK were worth double its exports to the rest of the world&#8212; &#163;44 billion and &#163;22 billion respectively&#8212;and manufacturing exports were estimated at &#163;13 billion.</p>

	<p pid="b.411.0/1">I welcome my hon. Friend&#8217;s point about manufacturing industry. Does he agree that the sizeable increase in manufacturing, which is taking place as we speak, has arisen mainly as a result of the Scottish contribution?</p>

	<p pid="b.411.1/1">I certainly concur with my right hon. Friend on that point.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/2">In addition to the shared opportunities, the pooling of resources across the UK allows risk as well as reward to be spread, as seen most notably in the bail-out of the Scottish-based banks during the financial crisis, when the UK, led by a Scot, injected &#163;37 billion of capital into the banks&#8212;an amount in excess of the total budget of the Scottish Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/3">The legal framework for business is more or less uniform across the entirety of the UK. That means that there is a similar taxation, regulatory and employment law regime throughout the UK. On the benefit of a single market both to Scotland and to the rest of the UK, the director general of the CBI has stated that the</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/4">&#8220;raft of common laws and regulations...make operating across the different constituent parts of the union more efficient.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/5">The National Institute of Economic and Social Research has noted that the Scottish economy is</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/6">&#8220;more integrated with the rest of the UK than Europe or the rest of the world.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/7">With regard to jobs, people on both sides of the border benefit from employment opportunities engendered by Scotland being part of the Union. The UK Government are a major employer in Scotland, with more than</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/8">30,000 civil servants bringing almost &#163;700 million annually to Scotland in salaries alone. Thousands of jobs also rely on the defence sector in Scotland, with 40,000 people employed in more than 800 companies. Companies from the rest of the UK contribute about one fifth of private sector economic activity in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/9">On energy, North sea oil is an important contributor to the UK economy, accounting for thousands of jobs in the north-east of Scotland, and a valuable source of revenue for the UK Treasury. However, the supply is declining and unstable. Recent reports show that North sea oil production fell by 30% in 2011 compared with the previous year. For the past 18 years, the level of public spending in Scotland has dwarfed the total revenue from North sea oil; in 2009-10, the difference was &#163;18 billion. In fact, welfare spending in Scotland in 2010 was three times higher than North sea oil revenue. Of course, oil and gas remain an important part of the Scottish and UK economies and will do so in the years to come, but to bet Scotland&#8217;s economic future on this sector, as the Scottish National party does, is naive at best and foolhardy at worst. Moreover, Scotland being outwith the UK would create uncertainty for the future of Scotland&#8217;s renewables industry, and potentially lead to higher fuel bills and a &#163;2 billion burden on Scottish businesses, due to Scotland receiving a disproportionate share of the available subsidy compared with the rest of the UK. These figures highlight the many benefits of Scotland being part of the UK economy in that we are able to work together in partnership to share the risks and rewards involved in harnessing our energy resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/10">Scotland being part of the UK also allows us to pool our resources and distribute them on the basis of social need across the welfare state. If it were outwith the UK, that would place a major question mark over its ability to continue to fund benefits at current levels and to meet state and public sector pension commitments. It is simply an illusion for the SNP to promise Scandinavian levels of welfare spending while supporting Irish levels of taxation.</p>
	<p pid="b.411.1/11">There are many other positives on which I could elaborate, such as the flexibility across borders which has over the years benefited people on both sides and led to high levels of migration in both directions; indeed, I personally have been a beneficiary of that. Our common currency is one of the oldest monetary unions in the world. A practical and more recent example is the benefit derived by Scottish athletes from UK sports funding, facilities and coaching in the run-up to the Olympics and Paralympics. It is interesting to note that all but three of the Scots who won medals at the Olympics had team-mates from the rest of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.412.1/1">Indeed I am. All three&#8212;Sir Chris Hoy, Andy Murray and Katherine Grainger&#8212;train and reside in England and clearly benefit from Scotland being part of the United Kingdom. Of course, we pay tribute to those athletes as part of Team GB and wish them every success in the BBC sports personality of the year award. <i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> Indeed, they cannot all win, but we would like to see them do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.412.1/2">There is much more I could say about the benefits to Scotland and the rest of the UK of Scotland remaining a strong partner within the Union. I am sure that other Members will fill any gaps in my speech and expand on some of the points I have made. I conclude by mentioning one of Scotland&#8217;s and the UK&#8217;s most notable achievements in its 300-year history&#8212;devolution. Devolution has been a great success and has provided new vigour to the United Kingdom. Whether in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland, devolution is working but also developing, as it will continue to do in future. As we are all well aware, support for devolution and attachment to the UK in Scotland is stronger than support for independence. Scots share the same social attitudes and values as people in the rest of the UK. They are just as alert to the risks and uncertainties of separation and have a real comprehension of the benefits and advantages of remaining part of the UK. Therefore, all things considered, there is no doubt that we are all better off together.</p>

	<p pid="b.413.0/1">It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to contribute to this timely and important debate, and I congratulate my hon.

Member for Livingston (Graeme Morrice)</phrase> set out very well many of the practical benefits that Scotland and, indeed, the rest of the United Kingdom gain from the Union, be it in defence, finance and economic matters, or our influence on the world stage. We could, and should, have a full debate on each of those points, and I am sure that in the course of the next year or two, leading up to the referendum, they will all be fully explored. To summarise the benefits&#8212;I think that the hon. Gentleman used this phrase&#8212;the strength of the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. We are stronger together.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.0/3">Scotland could go it alone as a separate country. I am not one of those who believes that it would be an impoverished basket case of a country that could not survive on its own. Of course it could, but at what cost? Together, we are stronger, more influential, safer and more prosperous. It would be much riskier for everyone if Scotland went it alone.</p>

	<p pid="b.413.2/1">I am puzzled. Is the hon. Gentleman asking for other countries to come and join us in the United Kingdom? That is a very interesting notion.</p>
	<p pid="b.413.2/2">A few years ago, the global banking crisis sent economic shockwaves around the world. The SNP used to make a claim for the arc of prosperity that would link a separate Scotland with Ireland and Iceland, but that arc has rusted somewhat in the light of events. A separate Scotland could potentially have weathered that storm,</p>
	<p pid="b.413.2/3">but the resilience that we had as a country was much stronger because we were the United Kingdom and not split up into atomised parts.</p>

	<p pid="b.414.1/1">I cannot give those figures off the top of my head. If the hon. Gentleman is suggesting that Iceland was any better placed to weather the storm than the United Kingdom, that is a slightly revisionist view of history.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.1/2">Another issue is Scotland&#8217;s role in the European Union if it becomes a separate country. There was an interesting debate on that in Westminster Hall last week. In the interests of brevity, I will not rehearse all the arguments. I believe strongly that if Scotland went its own way and wanted to be part of the EU, it would happen on the EU&#8217;s terms. Scotland would be sucked into full currency, fiscal and political union, which would not be to its benefit.</p>

	<p pid="b.414.3/1">I will not give way again.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.3/2">The EU issue makes a mockery of the SNP&#8217;s independence policy. It is perfectly logical to argue that if Scotland does not like one economic union and wants to be the master of its own destiny, it should go its own way, but to argue that it should then join an ever-deepening union is utterly illogical.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.3/3">The fact that we are having a referendum at all is risky as it may be a distraction from what we should be concentrating on. I do not doubt for a minute that it is perfectly within Scotland&#8217;s right to have the debate and to have the matter resolved. As a democrat, I fully accept that the Scottish National party won a majority in the last Scottish Parliament elections and that a referendum was part of its manifesto. It is therefore perfectly legitimate to have the debate. But at what cost? The constitutional uncertainty in Canada in the 1980s and 1990s had a severe impact on the economic prosperity of Quebec. The EU admitted that in a report.</p>

	<p pid="b.414.5/1">If the hon. Gentleman will forgive me, I have a number of points that I want to make and I have already been generous in giving way to him.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.5/2">A report by economists at the appropriately named Scotiabank in Canada said of the 1995 referendum:</p>
	<p pid="b.414.5/3">&#8220;The palpable fear in the markets was keyed off deep intertwined concerns about the country&#8217;s fiscal, economic and political circumstances.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.414.5/4">The very fact that we are having this debate is therefore risky as it may distract us. However, I accept that it is legitimate that we are having it.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.5/5">My main point relates not to the economic or defence arguments or to Scotland&#8217;s influence on the global stage, but is a personal and emotional appeal. My nationality is British. I do not want to be rendered stateless or to be forced to choose between the place of</p>
	<p pid="b.414.5/6">my birth and the place I now call home. The country that would be left would be the rest of the United Kingdom and its flag would be, as the noble Lord Forsyth described it, &#8220;an anaemic red asterisk&#8221; once the blue of the saltire was taken out.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.5/7">As far as I can tell, my blood is 100% Scottish. My father has traced the generations of the family back to the 1700s. Unless there is something we do not know about, my family came from a small area in Lanarkshire and Ayrshire. I spent my childhood in Scotland. My primary and secondary education was in Scotland, but my higher education was in England. Three quarters of my working life has been spent in England. Through marriage and my family, I have many relatives who are part Scottish and part English. I have stood for public office five times: twice in Scotland and three times in England. My Scottish ventures were somewhat less successful than my English ones. I stood for South Lanarkshire council and for Glasgow Rutherglen. Let us just say that I saved my deposit on both occasions.</p>
	<p pid="b.414.5/8">As my hon. Friend the Member for Epping Forest said forcefully, of course Scotland and England have distinct cultures that are expressed through the arts and on the sporting field, but both can be vibrant within the Union. Patriotism does not require nationalism to flourish. Beyond a patriotic pride, the United Kingdom has something that is much stronger. Team GB at the Olympic games exemplified it, the monarchy exemplifies it, and even James Bond exemplifies it. We have an identity that has been forged through more than 300 years of the world&#8217;s most successful and enduring Union. We do not need to change. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40044" name="Michael Weir">The hon. Member for Angus (Mr Weir)</phrase> said that that is history. It is history, but it is also the present and I believe that it is the future. For goodness&#8217; sake, let us not throw away what we have achieved and what makes us strong, prosperous and successful in an ever-changing world that is becoming more dangerous and uncertain. We have something that is strong and that works; let us keep it.</p>

I reassure the House that he is back home and making a full recovery. I fully expect him to be back in his place very soon, talking about the Laffer curve and endogenous growth theory as only he can.</p>
	<p pid="b.415.0/5">Another person who is missing is <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase>. We were all expecting his presence today and to hear his</p>
	<p pid="b.415.0/6">words of wisdom on Scotland and the Union, but he is not here. He is a bit like Brigadoon: one gets a glimpse of him only once a year.</p>
	<p pid="b.415.0/7">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40249" name="Eleanor Laing">the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing)</phrase> on the motion. It is a good motion. I take exception only with the last two lines of it, as she knows. There is so much more that she could have added, such as the contribution that Scots have made to the Union and the United Kingdom. She missed out the enlightenment, for goodness&#8217; sake, which is an important way in which the Scots contributed to the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom and the Union have also given much to Scotland. The Scots have helped to build and have shared the great institutions of the UK and the Union. We have fantastic cultural relationships and we have had great times. All of that is part of a social union and that will go nowhere. We will continue to be British after the independence referendum and when we secure our independence.</p>

	<p pid="b.416.1/1">I expected that response. In fact, it said on Twitter that that intervention would be made.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.1/2">I say to the Minister that, as we examine our relationship with the rest of the United Kingdom, we discover some of these fantastic ties. I accept that there will be vestiges of Britishness. That is a personal interest of mine. We are British. I live in Perth in the north of the island called Great Britain. It is called that because it is the largest of the British isles. I am British as much as somebody from Stockholm or Copenhagen is Scandinavian. That is the reality of geography and it cannot be denied. Hon. Members may want to take forward their obsession with separation by building a channel between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom. That is the only way that they could stop us being British.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.1/3">I accept that being British is about more than just geography. Of course there is something cultural about Britishness. However, Britishness is an invention. It was a necessary social construct to unite all the nations of the United Kingdom. That is why it is so hard to define and describe. We have heard some great and excruciating attempts to define Britishness. Who could forget the attempt of the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, when he talked about</p>
	<p pid="b.416.1/4">&#8220;British jobs for British workers&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="b.416.1/5">I remember the attempt by Michael Portillo, when he described Britishness as anti-fanaticism. However, Britishness is more than that. It is the combination of the 300 years that we have shared and endured across these islands. It is about everything from the industrial revolution to how we stood together in the wars; the Queen has been mentioned, and, of course, there are great pop and rock bands.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.1/6">I was particularly disappointed with the views of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase> who tried to scaremonger on the issue of culture. He said that British music would be no longer &#8220;our&#8221; music but &#8220;their&#8221; music&#8212;whoever &#8220;they&#8221; are. I played in a band for 15 years. I replaced an English keyboard player and the lead singer of my band is Canadian. To suggest that something as free-spirited as music can be confined to borders or frontiers is absurd and ridiculous. The right hon. Member for Edinburgh South West should be ashamed of trying to scaremonger about culture.</p>
	<p pid="b.416.1/7">One good definition of Britishness&#8212;as has been mentioned fleetingly&#8212;was the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games, which got close to describing and defining Britishness. Danny Boyle did a fantastic job with his cultural tour de force. The big irony, however, is that part of that fantastic presentation placed a strong emphasis on the country&#8217;s social ethos, and particularly on the NHS, which the Westminster Tories are currently disestablishing through privatisation. Already, part of that glimpse of Britishness disappears with that very statement.</p>

	<p pid="b.417.1/1">I will not give way to the hon. Lady, because I do not have much time.</p>
	<p pid="b.417.1/2">That Britishness has no place in discussions on independence simply because it cannot be un-invented. We cannot un-invent all our ties, heritage and culture; we will always have a shared history and joint heritage, and there will always be cultural relationships and collaboration.</p>
	<p pid="b.417.1/3">Independence will bring a new, improved relationship between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom, because we will come to it from a position of equality and mutual respect. Most people in Scotland now describe themselves as Scottish&#8212;some, of course, describe themselves as and feel profoundly British, but most surveys of social attitude suggest that most Scots now present themselves as Scottish.</p>
	<p pid="b.417.1/4">As we have gone forward with our own national Parliament and strengthened our institutions, Scottish people are feeling more secure in their identity and more culturally relaxed about who they are. That is why we are able to adopt different identities and why we can easily accept the idea of being Scottish&#8212;we could be Pakistani Scottish, Indian Scottish, Polish Scottish, but we are all Scottish and that is how people now describe themselves. With independence, we could express our unique Scottishness in world institutions. We could bring Scottish values to international affairs and institutions, and that would only be good for people in Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.417.5/1">I do not have time. As the hon. Lady will know, I have used my two minutes&#8217; injury time.</p>
	<p pid="b.417.5/2">Our gripe is with political arrangements within the United Kingdom. We want to recalibrate political relationships within the UK; we want powers to grow our economy and make our own international contribution. We want to complete the powers of our Parliament and take responsibility for our affairs. We have no issue with our British past, heritage and culture, and they will be defining features of how we go forward as Scottish people.</p>
	<p pid="b.417.5/3">I find talk of separation and the idea that people will become &#8220;foreigners&#8221; dispiriting and depressing. Some of the language used has become quite chilling and I am getting a bit concerned. When people are described as foreigners I feel a little uncomfortable. I know that people have to build up the idea of Scotland as an unviable nation, and suggest that it is a risk and that there is scary stuff out there if it becomes independent, but can we please be careful with some of the language used when people build up that theme of separation? Negativity is a big and necessary part of the case and construct used by those who oppose independence.</p>
	<p pid="b.417.5/4">We have heard about the past and the things that unite us, and about our great relationships and institutions and the contribution that Scotland has made to the United Kingdom, but what about the future. What does Scotland get if it says no in a referendum on independence? Can we have a guarantee that if it remains in the Union, Scotland will be part of the EU in 10 years&#8217; time? We have heard lots of talk about rolling back the achievements of the devolution era, but can we be certain that the gains of devolution will be secure if Scotland says no? Will the Scottish Parliament get more powers and&#8212;most importantly&#8212;if Scotland says no to independence, will the Scottish people be more prosperous? People have had 300 years to think about these issues, but nobody will give us answers. Those against independence have to come up with a case for Scotland to remain in the Union, but we have not heard it yet. Some of today&#8217;s contributions have been a little more positive, but we must hear a lot more about what people want to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="b.417.5/5">Those of us in favour of Scottish independence will, of course, be positive and put the case for it. I love my country and I want it to be all that it can. I want it to walk tall and for Scotland to have the national self-respect and dignity to make its own place in the world, take its own decisions, and ensure that the Scottish people are responsible for their own failures. We are a dynamic, inventive and resourceful people. Of course we will make a success of independence, and I am glad we no longer hear comments of &#8220;Too wee, too poor, too stupid.&#8221; Of course Scotland will be a success when it gets its independence; of course we will be great.</p>
	<p pid="b.417.5/6">I am depressed about the fact that Scotland is tethered to a failing UK state which is almost relaxed about its own failure. Scotland deserves better. I do not want the welfare reforms or years and years of austerity. I do not want illegal wars or nuclear weapons just outside. I want my country to make its own decisions about its future. An independent Scotland will be better because those who care most about it will make the decisions, not the Westminster Tories. The Scottish people will run Scotland and be responsible for their own decisions. It will be better because we care more about our nation than the Westminster Tories. That is why we run our devolved institutions better&#8212;we care about them and ensure we look after them.</p>
	<p pid="b.417.5/7">After Scotland becomes independent, we will continue to have fantastic cultural relationships and ties with the rest of the United Kingdom. That is important to us and has shaped who we are as the Scottish people. We have heard about the 305 years in which we have served together, the wonderful institutions we have built up, and our great ties and associations. Those things will go absolutely nowhere. The social union is important to us as independent Scottish people and we will enjoy and build on it. It will be better because we will come together in a sense of equality and mutual respect. We will build new British arrangements and relationships and they will be better because Scotland will be an independent nation. The political union has failed Scotland. We no longer want to be tethered to a failing UK state. We can be better. We can walk tall in the world and make decisions on our own. Scotland as an independent nation will be welcomed as a full, peace-loving nation in the world community. I look forward to that day. The social union lives on; the political union is dying and it will be finished off in 2014.</p>

	<p pid="b.419.0/1">I am almost tempted to wish that there was no time limit, because <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> was making his case more strongly than anyone on either side of the House could have done. He clearly forgot his &#8220;Yes Scotland&#8221; positivity pills this morning, as it took nine minutes before we heard any positive case for Scotland&#8217;s becoming an independent country.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.0/2">We need to change the language of this debate, and I pay tribute to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40249" name="Eleanor Laing">the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing)</phrase> and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40374" name="Graeme Morrice">the Member for Livingston (Graeme Morrice)</phrase> who have pushed this debate and provided us with an opportunity to do so today. We need a positive, engaging debate about what is in the best interests of Scotland and the UK&#8217;s future, not the language of whether Scotland is too small or too wee to be a successful country&#8212;incidentally, only SNP Members say that; no Labour Members have ever used such language. The question that I would throw back to the nationalists is this. I believe that the people of Scotland are creative, talented and innovative enough to be successful in the United Kingdom&#8212;why don&#8217;t they?</p>
	<p pid="b.419.0/3">The referendum is not about whether Scotland can or cannot manage on its own. Of course Scotland could be a successful, independent country, and it insults the intelligence of the Scottish people to suggest that it could not. The choice is not about whether Scotland can be successful but about whether it would be a fairer and more prosperous country with more opportunities if it works in partnership with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Labour Members believe that it will be, and we will be making that positive case in the referendum.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.0/4">I am not modest about Scotland&#8217;s ambitions. I genuinely believe that Scotland stands taller and shouts louder when it works in partnership with other areas of the UK, representing ourselves on the global stage. Yes, the Union has a proud history&#8212;300 years of shared history, security and prosperity. It has enjoyed success, as hon. Members have heard many times before. A Scot created the Bank of England, a Welshman our NHS and an Englishman our welfare state&#8212;but this is not about history; it is about Scotland&#8217;s future.</p>
	<p pid="b.419.0/5">Scotland deserves an open, engaging debate, not only on its constitutional settlement, but, more importantly, on what kind of Scotland we want to live in and want our children to live in. What will Scotland look like in 20 years&#8217; time? Will it be able to compete with other parts of the UK and in the world?</p>

	<p pid="b.420.0/1">I am sure the hon. Gentleman is aware that inequality in Scotland increased over the term of the previous Labour Government. Does he believe Scotland will fulfil its potential as an equal and fair society as part of the Union?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-29b.420.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40271" speakername="Anas Sarwar" colnum="420"  time="013:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121129/debtext/121129-0002.htm#12112958002160">
	<p pid="b.420.1/1">It is untrue to say that health inequalities widened under the Labour Government, but it is factually correct to say that inequalities are increasing in Scotland under the watch of Alex Salmond, Nicola Sturgeon and the Scottish Government. Health inequalities are increasing and educational opportunities are decreasing. People from working class backgrounds in Scotland are less likely to go to college or university than people from working class backgrounds in England and Wales. That is happening on the watch of the Scottish National party, not of the Tories or Labour, so will the hon. Lady please not lecture Labour Members on our record? She should focus more on her party&#8217;s record in government.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/2">What Scotland do we want to create for future generations? We want it to be a successful country in which to bring up our children, but what role do we want Scotland to play in the world? I want Scotland not to isolate itself, but to engage with its partners in the UK to take on the big challenges of global poverty, to fight climate change, and to fight for justice and fairness in the world. What differentiates Labour Members and SNP Members? Labour Members did not come into politics because we wanted to fight poverty only in our constituencies or our country. We want to fight poverty and create opportunity not only in Glasgow and Edinburgh, but in Manchester, Birmingham and around the world. I do not believe we will do that by creating a border between Scotland and England. There is a vote on a UN resolution today on enhanced status for the Palestinian people, which will hopefully work towards a positive resolution by which we have an independent Palestinian state living side by side with Israel. I came into politics to fight for an independent Palestinian state and for self-determination for the people of Kashmir, not to break up my own country. I want to fight injustice in other parts of the world.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/3">One big point is that we can make the positive case for Scotland economically, emotionally, socially and politically. The most successful aid agency in the world is headquartered in Scotland. It employs hundreds of people, has a budget of &#163;7 billion, helps to save hundreds of thousands of lives every year, and lifts hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty every year, which demonstrates the collective strength of Scotland working in partnership. We are a key member of the UN Security Council not for power or prestige, but to fight tyranny and oppression around the world. I want Scotland to have its full voice in that process. We are a leading economy and country in the G8. A Scottish leader as Prime Minister worked with the G8 to stop a global recession from becoming a global depression. Those are positive arguments for Scotland remaining part of the UK, not the negative arguments we get from the SNP.</p>
	<p pid="b.420.1/4">On the quality of the debate, we will have heated debates and the usual Scottish politics spats between Labour and the SNP and others between now and the referendum&#8212;<i>[</i> <i>Interruption.</i> <i>]</i> If the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire wants to make an intervention, I am more than happy to take it. We are divided politically, but we do not want our country to be divided in the process. Whatever happens in the referendum and whatever decision Scotland makes, we must ensure that we come together in the best interests of Scotland and ensure that we fight and create a fairer, more equal country.</p>

	<p pid="b.421.0/1">I apologise for not being in the Chamber at the start of the debate; I was in a Bill Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.0/2">My hon. Friend mentions the quality of the debate. Will that not be enhanced if the First Minister is straight with the Scottish people and if his arguments stay on the same track? The arc of prosperity used to mean Ireland and Iceland, but now it has moved on to the Scandinavian countries. Until we have a consistent and honest debate, we will not have a fair playing field.</p>

	<p pid="b.421.1/1">I wholeheartedly agree with my hon. Friend. When the Minister systematically destroyed the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire on Britishness, he reminded me that, throughout the SNP&#8217;s existence, it has claimed it wants independence because England has never treated Scotland fairly, and because Scotland has never had a fair deal within the UK, but SNP Members imagine that everyone will treat Scotland fairly and work together to create a better country when it separates from the UK. That just does not stack up.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/2">SNP Members make assertions on NATO and EU membership. The hon. Gentleman said today that the biggest threat to Scotland remaining part of the EU was from the UK, but he cannot guarantee that Scotland will remain a member of the EU if it chooses independence. We need facts rather than assertion. SNP Members say that Scotland will keep the pound and automatically have a seat on the Monetary Policy Committee; that the BBC will break up and Scotland will have better quality programmes; and that our credit rating and Royal Mail services will remain the same. They are assertions&#8212;not one of them is based on fact. The people of Scotland deserve better. Throughout the SNP&#8217;s existence, the answer to any question has always been &#8220;independence&#8221;, but now that the question is independence, it does not have the answers for the people of Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.421.1/3">Scotland deserves a transparent and open debate. It deserves to know what Scotland will look like if it chooses independence. It deserves better than a First Minister and a Scottish Government simply asserting that independence will be whatever people want it to be. That is not good enough. The SNP cannot say to one audience that Scotland will have the Monaco taxes, but then say to another audience that we will have Scandinavian public services. It cannot say that Scotland will have none of the horrible welfare changes and reforms, but that it will have similar corporation taxes to Ireland. That does not add up and is not credible, and disrespects the people of Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.422.0/1">The hon. Gentleman is making his points as he always does, but does he not accept that it is up to the people of Scotland whom they vote into power after independence, and that it is up to them to decide how the shape of the new Scotland develops? Surely he accepts that the people will decide that in the first election after we win independence in 2014.</p>

	<p pid="b.422.1/1">The people of Scotland have an opportunity, through strengthened devolution, to have more of a say in decisions on their lives made in the Scottish Parliament and in local government, which has taken a hammering under the current Scottish Government. They can recognise that although there is nowhere better than Scotland, there is somewhere bigger, and that is working in partnership with the UK and global agencies to take on the challenges.</p>

We do not fear an open and honest debate on the future of Scotland, or fear challenges to our record. We do not fear debating the future of our country.

	<p pid="b.422.6/1">I welcome the opportunity to take part in the debate and I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40249" name="Eleanor Laing">the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing)</phrase> and the co-sponsors on securing it. I will be pleased to go through the Lobby in support of the motion with parties from all parts of the House. We need to send a strong message that, in all parts of the United Kingdom, we believe that we are better together, and that this is not just a question of us believing that Scotland is better in the United Kingdom, but that people in other parts of the United Kingdom want Scotland to be part of the United Kingdom. I take part in the debate in that spirit, conscious that ultimately it is for the people of Scotland to decide how they vote in the referendum.</p>
	<p pid="b.422.6/2">Hon. Members will know that the ties between people in Northern Ireland and in Scotland are very close. There is strong and growing interest in and support for Ulster Scots culture and heritage in the Province. Many</p>
	<p pid="b.422.6/3">people in Northern Ireland can trace their lineage and family history to Scottish antecedents&#8212;indeed, I would say that my name is more common in Scotland than it is in Northern Ireland. When I see those coaches coming over on the ferry with the Dodds name on it, I often say to my party colleagues that I wish we could hire some of them at election time and have them traverse north Belfast, but I have not been able to persuade them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.422.6/4">Of course, I stand here as a member of a party that has &#8220;Unionist&#8221; as part of its title. Our party was formed at a critical time in the history of Northern Ireland, when the Union was clearly under threat. The years that followed were difficult: tragically, there was much violence and bloodshed; many people were injured, lives were lost and many still live with physical and mental scars. Thankfully, that period of violence is largely behind us, and although there are still some who would try to drag us backwards, they are small in number and it is clear that those who tried to destroy the Union by terrorism did not succeed.</p>
	<p pid="b.422.6/5">Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom as a whole, is a much better and different place today. Gone is the uncertainty about our future and our place in the UK. Indeed, right hon. and hon. Members will know, or be interested to learn if they are not aware of it, that support for the Union is at an all-time high, and is actually growing. A recent survey showed that a majority of people who traditionally would have described themselves as nationalist would, if there was a vote today, vote to remain part of the United Kingdom. There are many reasons why there is growing support for the Union, not least the fact that the violence has diminished and that under the current devolution settlement people feel that everybody has a say. To a large extent, people are in control of many areas of policy. They see parties and politicians who, while they have their differences&#8212;strong differences, which are sometimes illustrated in debates in this House&#8212;are working together for the betterment of all the people of Northern Ireland on the economic and social issues of the day. It is therefore important that we continue to strengthen, maintain and improve devolution where we can in Northern Ireland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It is dynamic and evolving, and we need to move it forward in that way.</p>

	<p pid="b.423.1/1">The hon. Gentleman makes an important point and I was just going to come on to that. While there is the case for devolution and people having a role in deciding issues in Northern Ireland, there is no doubt that the people who would at one time have looked to the Celtic tiger and envied what was happening in the south, have had a rude awakening about economic realities and the situation in the United Kingdom and other countries in the EU. It is clear that the massive economic boom in the Republic was built on a number of factors, not least a property boom that crashed dramatically. I have heard it said many times by people who traditionally look to the Irish Republic as their future, &#8220;Where would we be today if we&#8217;d been part of the eurozone? Where would we be today if we had been</p>
	<p pid="b.423.1/2">part of a country like the Irish Republic, instead of having our fortunes tied in with a bigger country like the United Kingdom?&#8221; That has been an important factor.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.1/3">Who would have believed 20 years ago that we would be talking about the danger to the Union coming from Scotland, rather than from Northern Ireland? I heard the leader of Sinn Fein say that he was going to campaign for a referendum in Northern Ireland. There is absolutely no support for that. Of course, we do not fear a referendum in Northern Ireland. We know that people would vote overwhelmingly to retain Northern Ireland&#8217;s membership of the United Kingdom. We are not opposed to it for any reason of concern about the outcome; however, under the provisions of the legislation, once Northern Ireland has a referendum, it has to happen every seven years, and we believe that that would be extremely destabilising and unnecessary. When I hear Gerry Adams talk about the need for a referendum, it is a long way from his cry that there would be united Ireland by 2016.</p>
	<p pid="b.423.1/4">Thankfully, the debate on the future of Scotland in the Union has never been tainted or stained in any way by violence and terrorism. The debate is being conducted in a peaceful and democratic way, and it will be decided through the ballot box. As I said, we respect the right of the Scottish people to decide their future. Of course, it is right and appropriate that people from other parts of the United Kingdom should have their say as well. We believe that we are better off together. That is an excellent campaign description&#8212;it is positive and people are responding to it. It is not being stated in an arrogant or aggressive way. Instead, people are saying, &#8220;We want you in Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.424.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman mentions Better Together, and I think I heard that the Irish Republic&#8217;s Agriculture Minister was at his recent party conference. Does he extend the Better Together ethos to the Republic&#8217;s Agriculture Minister, and would he like to be in one state with him?</p>

	<p pid="b.424.1/1">I think the hon. Gentleman knows me and my party well enough by now to know the answer to the question of whether we think we would be better off in the Irish Republic. We had a very successful party conference this year. The shadow Secretary of State spoke at our conference dinner, and the Secretary of State spoke to conference on the Saturday. I was delighted to hear her declare in unequivocal terms that she would never be neutral on the Union. Of course, we also had the representative from the Irish Republic. We welcome visitors from other states, and we have visitors from outside the United Kingdom&#8212;of course we do. The reason why the Agriculture Minister was there, appropriately, is that the Irish Republic is to take over the presidency of the EU, and the reform of the common agricultural policy is extremely important for Northern Ireland farmers. It is important to hear from that Minister and to lobby him directly, particularly at this time, on those important issues. The response to that in Northern Ireland was positive.</p>
	<p pid="b.424.1/2">We will continue to build good relations with our friends in the Irish Republic, but we make it very clear to them that we do not wish to join it. We can have good neighbourly relations and, increasingly I think, those in the Irish Republic recognise that they have enough</p>
	<p pid="b.424.1/3">problems of their own without taking on any more in Northern Ireland. They are content to stick with the status quo, and they have declared clearly that until people in Northern Ireland vote otherwise, they will respect totally the principle of consent.</p>
	<p pid="b.424.1/4">Time is going on and others have articulated the reasons why Scotland would be worse off if it left the Union. I agree with what has been said. Not only would Scotland be worse off, but the United Kingdom as a whole would suffer from Scotland&#8217;s absence. A fragmented United Kingdom would not be as strong as we are together. Without Scotland, we would be a smaller nation in every sense, not just in population, economy and geography, and that is something that we do not wish to see.</p>

	<p pid="b.425.1/1">No, I will not give way anymore. I have given way twice already and time is limited. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will make his own speech.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.1/2">This is a question not just of economics, but of our standing in the world. Our nation would be diminished if Scotland left, and with that would come a loss of influence and power. There are deep and lasting social and historical bonds that bind us all together in the constituent nations of the United Kingdom. The military links and the history of the regiments of the British Army have already been explored. It is the British Army&#8212;it is not made up of the nations of the United Kingdom. The UK did not evolve spontaneously; it came about as a result of our shared experiences and history, and of our bonds of language, culture and so on. Furthermore, of course, the union of the monarchy has been around for longer even than the political Union.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.1/3">Those are the bonds that have brought and tied us together as four countries, and they have grown, deepened and developed over time, with enormous consequences for ourselves and the rest of the world. Each of our countries&#8212;Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and England &#8212;and their people have all played their part in the development and prosperity of the UK, and those bonds continue. The contribution of the Scottish people and Scottish business remains vital, and the Union remains of benefit to both Scotland and the UK as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.1/4">I hope that the debate on the referendum will be conducted in a constructive spirit. I am glad that there will not be the negativity&#8212;the descent into violence and so on&#8212;seen so often in Northern Ireland. I believe strongly, however, that it is important that other members of the United Kingdom and people from all parts of the United Kingdom&#8212;whether London and the south-east, Northern Ireland, Wales, or the north of England&#8212;say, with respect, while acknowledging that it is a decision for the Scottish people, &#8220;We want you to be part of the UK. We value your membership, and we feel we would be poorer without you in the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.425.2/1">On one point, I think all sides of the House can agree: that in the debate so far, we have made it clear</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/2">that it is right that the people of Scotland determine their own destiny. Later, if I have time, I will refer to the position on 16 to 18-year-olds, but first I will make a few personal comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/3">My own political motivation has been the need for action where and for whom it is most needed, whether in my constituency or in one of the poorest countries in the world. Representing my constituency is my No. 1 priority, as it is for other right hon. and hon. Members, but throughout my time in the House I have worked alongside organisations committed to helping people with disabilities and assisting people from the most impoverished countries in the world&#8212;nothing inward-looking, nothing introspective. I managed to get two Acts of Parliament on the statute book covering both the subjects I have mentioned, and I believe that both Acts were to the advantage of the whole of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/4">Those twin factors are at the heart of my activity, and will continue to be so. In other words, lines on maps do not excite me at all. I do not judge people or their plight by where they live. Many people have no choice in where or how they are born and are not tempted by the ideological Disneyland of the Scottish National party. I abhor the jingoistic mentality that peddles the myth of a Scottish solution for this, or an English solution for that. Time and again in the House, we have seen that the best solutions are those that are in the interest of the whole of the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/5">I do not accept the politics of parochial arrogance, but I worry that Scotland is moving towards that, with the police becoming one authority, likewise the fire services, and the statement from a member of the Scottish Government this week about reducing the already rather small number of Scottish local authorities. I much prefer to take a more international perspective on these matters, and I am much more inclined to the view expressed by former President Bill Clinton:</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/6">&#8220;The world has become completely interdependent, but we can&#8217;t make up our minds what that interdependence is going to look like. Interdependence simply means you can&#8217;t get a divorce&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/7">Time does not allow me to develop the theme, but I think it is fundamentally true.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/8">In 2010, the British people spoke and, like it or not, we have in place a coalition Government. Upon their election, the coalition Government narrative was that the economic mess was all Labour&#8217;s fault. It has to be said that that line was successful for a short period, but with the passage of time and increased borrowing, to an extent we have hardly ever known, no one now believes it to be true. Economies throughout Europe are on their knees, and our constituents can see on their television screens public demonstrations in countries where Governments are implementing severe austerity measures. The question is not how many countries are struggling financially; it might be easier to name countries that are not.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/9">Why then am I against Scotland seeking a divorce from the United Kingdom? I am against it mainly for economic reasons, but there are other reasons that, if time allows, I will explain. One third of newly created manufacturing jobs in the UK have been created in Scotland recently. UK firms employ one in five Scottish workers. Scottish exports to countries outside the UK had a value of &#163;22 billion. Scottish exports to England, Wales and Northern Ireland totalled &#163;44.9 billion. The Scottish banking sector was saved by the UK</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/10">and the decisions of the former Chancellor, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40241" name="Alistair Darling">the Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.425.2/11">Leaving one economic union of 63 million to join one of 330 million and expecting an equivalent say in monetary policy is an absurd notion, while a race to the bottom with Ireland when it comes to corporation tax rates does not fill me with optimism&#8212;quite the reverse. Likewise, relying on oil when we have experienced 12 consecutive years of decline in the amount of gas and oil extracted from the North sea is not wise. It is a dwindling resource, not a foundation for the future.</p>

	<p pid="b.427.0/1">My right hon. Friend is making an exceptional and passionate case for economic co-operation within the United Kingdom. Does he share my concern that, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, by 2040 we will see an elevenfold decline in oil and gas revenues? Does that not demonstrate why, if we are to diversify the economy, we should do it from a position of strength within the UK?</p>

	<p pid="b.427.1/1">That is an excellent point, and I am delighted that my hon. Friend makes it.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.1/2">Last weekend, I was in a town centre of my constituency talking to my constituents and listening to their views, mainly on independence. I am bound to say that my experience was clear and unequivocal: there is no appetite in Scotland for a referendum, and people are curious to know why, if we insist on having one, we have to wait until 2014. They are worried about issues of concern to this House: unemployment, food prices, energy prices, petrol prices and much more. People are struggling to cope financially, and for many a referendum is a complete and utter waste of time and money, but that is the reality we face, so let us have the debate. Economies all over the globe are struggling with the worldwide downturn, so let us not pretend it is happening only in the UK. Of course some people want independence, and they are entitled to that view&#8212;I respect it, but disagree profoundly with them. When I visit schools in my constituency, I find that some pupils want independence, but the vast majority do not want to separate Scotland from the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.427.3/1">My hon. Friend makes a good point. I cannot remember anyone saying that. I remember what I would describe as a great surge among my constituents against independence and them telling me to get down here and fight what they are opposed to: separatism.</p>
	<p pid="b.427.3/2">Still talking about young people, I recently visited Cardinal Newman school in Bellshill&#8212;an important part of Scotland, represented by my hon. Friend and I &#8212;and spoke to a modern studies class. At the end, I asked about a subject that we did not touch on in our earlier discussion.

	<p pid="b.428.1/1">That is an interesting point and I am glad my hon. Friend has made it.</p>
	<p pid="b.428.1/2">I am no different from the constituents I have described. In the last Parliament&#8212;my hon. Friends will not be surprised that I am raising this issue&#8212;I worked with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40411" name="Edward Balls">the Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls)</phrase>, now the shadow Chancellor. Our joint activity produced &#163;340 million to help children with disabilities throughout the United Kingdom. Scotland&#8217;s share was &#163;34 million, but none of the money was ever seen by children with disabilities. Sadly, children with disabilities did not receive one penny of the cash. It became known as the missing millions. Obfuscation was the response from the First Minster to questions posed by Wendy Alexander and Johann Lamont. The First Minster was given every opportunity to come clean on what had happened to the money. I wrote to him and asked for a meeting. He replied that he was too busy and his diary too full, but he passed my office on at least six occasions on his way to and from a neighbouring by-election, and I passed him on the stairs when he was down here voting against the Labour Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.428.1/3">That was a shocking and disgraceful decision by a Scottish Government led by Mr Salmond. Indeed, that high-handed imperious attitude cast a doubt in my mind about whether the First Minister could ever be trusted as the leader of a country. In the last few years the SNP has attempted to define Scottish patriotism to the outside world&#8212;a patriotism that in their hands is simple to the point of being simple minded, self-loving to the point of being self-deceiving, and nostalgic to the point of being destructively naive. I have greater faith that the people of Scotland have a great sense of what is right and what is wrong, and will vote accordingly when the time comes.</p>

	<p pid="b.428.4/1">Our debates on Scottish issues are often tribal, so I was not surprised by the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> or the degree of fundamentalism he showed in his speech, although I was surprised at his arrogance and his assumption that after an independence referendum the Scottish people would enter some sort of nirvana. That is not quite consistent with our history at any time I can recall.</p>
	<p pid="b.428.4/2">The way the hon. Gentleman approached the whole issue underlines one of the major problems with this debate: the lack of fact. If we look ahead at what sort of country an independent Scotland might be&#8212;and we need to, because that is one of the things that anyone taking the referendum seriously would want to know&#8212;we can see what the various sides of the argument are presenting us with. What the Scottish Government are presenting us with at the moment is: &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep the monarch&#8221;, &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep the pound sterling&#8221;&#8212;perhaps&#8212;&#8220;and the Bank of England as our central bank&#8221;, and &#8220;We&#8217;ll remain part of the EU,&#8221; although that is still an open question. I was quite taken by what Mr Barroso&#8212;in effect, the chief executive of the European Union, who should know a thing or two about these things&#8212;said about an independent Scotland having to reapply. Mr Salmond leapt to his feet and said, &#8220;No we won&#8217;t. I know better.&#8221; That is basically the way all this has proceeded.</p>
	<p pid="b.428.4/3">We are not being presented with facts; as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40271" name="Anas Sarwar">the Member for Glasgow Central (Anas Sarwar)</phrase> said, they are assertions. I would be a wee bit kinder than that: they might be aspirations, but they are more likely the product of politicians who want to remove difficult issues from the agenda before the referendum. We would see a very different Scotland afterwards if it were outside the EU, forced to create its own central bank and introduce a new currency. I mention the currency because the only other similar experience that I am aware of is when the Czech Republic and Slovakia split. I think it was the Czech Prime Minister who said that they had agreed to keep the same currency, but within a matter of weeks that decision was changed and a new currency had to be created. I cannot see a Scotland in the same situation being any different, even if I believed that that was the intention. However, what we know so far&#8212;about the monarch, the pound sterling, the Bank of England as the reserve bank and being part of the EU&#8212;does not sound very much like independence to me.</p>

	<p pid="b.429.1/1">The hon. Gentleman has intervened many times and thereby had more than 10 minutes already. I would rather make my own contribution to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.429.1/2">It is important that we have facts. One area where that is most important is the economy of an independent Scotland. It is quite clear from all their forecasts that the current Scottish Government would rely heavily on North sea oil revenues. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40274" name="William Bain">the Member for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain)</phrase> has already made the point from the Front Bench, but I want to give a bit more detail, because it is extremely important that accurate facts are readily available. The first point to consider about the oil and gas industry is just how volatile these commodities are. Prices can rise or fall very quickly. I am old enough to remember in the 1980s when the oil price went from $32 a barrel to $8 a barrel virtually overnight. We lost more than 50,000 jobs in the north-east of Scotland when that happened. An independent country would have found it difficult to survive that event. Unless we are talking about a prosperous middle eastern country with no resources other than oil, it is very dangerous to rely on oil and gas for the economy.</p>
	<p pid="b.429.1/3">We have to look at the research. The most accurate and trusted UK commentator on the oil and gas industry is Professor Alec Kemp of Aberdeen university. For decades, he and his colleague Linda Stephen have studied the UK oil and gas industry, and their regular reports are respected and accepted throughout the industry. The most recent report looks at the prospects for activity on the UK continental shelf following the recent oil tax changes. The report is very detailed and considers the prospects for oil and gas production in the next 30 years in the UK sector. In the last two years production has declined, partly because of the tax changes in the 2010 Budget, but also as a result of the large increase in unplanned shutdowns. That has had an almost immediate effect on the amount of revenue coming into the Exchequer. Also, the North sea infrastructure is very old, and there has been a large number of unplanned shutdowns.</p>
	<p pid="b.429.1/4">The report details scenarios in which the oil price is $70 a barrel, and the gas price 40p a therm. The potential number of fields in production in 2042&#8212; 30 years from now&#8212;will fall from 300 to about 60. In that same scenario, oil and gas equivalent production would fall from today&#8217;s level of about 1.8 million to 584,000 barrels a day. That is at a price of $70 dollars a barrel and 40p a therm. At a price of $90 dollars and 55p, production would fall from 1.8 million barrels of oil equivalent a day to 520,000. Most of the money and energy would go into decommissioning the North sea platforms that were being rendered redundant, and I do not think it appropriate for a new country to build its economy around the destruction of its most productive industry. We need to see many more such facts on the table before anyone can make a serious decision about what is best for our country.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40036" name="Frank Doran">the Member for Aberdeen North (Mr Doran)</phrase>. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase> talked about how, come independence, the Scots would be able to walk tall. I have been to Perth, and I have not noticed anyone walking with their head bowed of late. I know plenty of Scots who walk tall. Scotland walks tall; it is only little-minded people who do not.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/2">&#8220;Scotland and the Union&#8221; is the title of our debate today. There would be no Union without Scotland. Scotland and England came together to form the Union under the two Crowns more than 300 years ago, and we have moved on since then. Who would have thought that, 300 years on, we would be having a debate and a referendum on how we might split ourselves up after all this time? The Scots have defended the Union with their lives and with their labour for centuries. We have led battles on the battlefield, and we have led in science and technology. The Scots not only pull their weight; they over-pull their weight. As a nation, we walk tall and we hold our heads high. Scots are known throughout the world for that. There are probably more Scots outside Scotland than in it, and as we get further away from home, we often get more nationalistic, with a small n.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/3">I have great concerns about the way in which Scotland is being governed at the moment. It has a majority Government, but there is no scrutiny of any of the Bills that the Government pass or of any of the work they do. They have a committee system that is very similar to</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/4">our own Select Committee system. In our system, when a Member joins a Select Committee, they do so not as a member of a party. Their job is to scrutinise the Government or the people who are running the industry of our country. We do not do that with any party bias. In Scotland, however, there is no scrutiny. The Committees are being run with a party bias. Whatever happens, the Scottish National party is right and everyone else is wrong. Any amendments that are tabled to a Bill are automatically shouted down.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/5">The bullying by the Scottish Government that seems to be going on is an absolute disgrace. People are being threatened, and companies are told that if they do not do as they are told, they will not get contracts. That is no way to run a country. It is certainly no way to run an independent country. I have great fears about that, and we should look seriously at how the scrutiny of Government Bills is carried out in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/6">It will be no surprise to anyone that I also want to mention shipbuilding. Shipbuilding on the Clyde has sustained Scotland for centuries. When the tobacco trade first started up, the development of shipbuilding on the Clyde created employment and made Glasgow the second biggest city in the empire. That would never have happened if we had not been part of the British empire and of Great Britain. We led then, and I believe that, in many ways, we lead now. The Type 45 destroyer is the best ship of its kind anywhere in the world. It is envied by the Americans, by the Russians and by anyone who has any idea of what a destroyer should look like. It is a cut above everything else.</p>
	<p pid="b.430.0/7">We would not have those ships without the decision by the British Government to build them. If the last Labour Government had not secured the procurement of those ships, the Clyde would now be closed. I have absolutely no doubt that, under independence, the Clyde would close almost the next day, and that 3,500 jobs would be lost&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.431.1/1">Not this side of hell freezing over!</p>
	<p pid="b.431.1/2">The Scottish Government want to sell thousands of jobs, and there would be no more ships on the Clyde. I am a Glaswegian. I am Scottish, but I am probably a Glaswegian before anything else. I am also British and proud of it. I want people to vote in the referendum. I want us to get through it so that Scotland can get back to where it should be. When we have voted down the proposal for independence, we need to give serious consideration to how the governing is being done in the Scottish Parliament. I believe that the threatening and bullying, and the lack of scrutiny of Bills, needs to be looked at seriously. Those are the most important things.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.1/3">In the short time I have left, I also want to mention the cost of separation. There would be a cost not only to Scotland but to the United Kingdom. I have tabled a parliamentary question to various Departments to ask how much it would cost simply to re-badge everything from the day of independence. How many millions of pounds would it cost not only the people of Scotland but the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland? How much would every single taxpayer have to pay? And there would be further costs when jobs were lost as the companies that are threatening to move out did so. Just this week, BAE Systems was threatening to do that.</p>
	<p pid="b.431.1/4">Scotland is better together with the United Kingdom, and I have no doubt that we will remain one of the leading countries of the world.</p>

	<p pid="b.432.0/1">It is a great privilege to contribute to the debate after so many fine contributions from right hon. and hon. Members. I echo the sentiments of those on both sides of the House who have said that they are intensely proud to be Scottish or to have Scottish ancestry, but also to be British and to be citizens of the United Kingdom. I, too, fervently hold those joint allegiances. I would also say to the Scottish National party that it does not have a monopoly on care, passion and wisdom when it comes to the future of Scotland, and I do not believe its assertions about the land of milk and honey that it plans to create.</p>

	<p pid="b.432.2/1">No, I am sorry; I want to make progress.</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/2">Like most in this Chamber, I am ambitious for Scotland and for the United Kingdom. I agree that, with a strong Scottish Parliament within the UK, we have the best of both worlds. I have always believed that there is a better choice for the future than divorce, secession and separation. I want to illustrate that through an aspect of Scottish life that is dear to our hearts&#8212;namely, sporting activity.</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/3">As an avid football fan, I have supported the Scottish team for many years, although I do not go back 140 years to the 0-0 draw. I would like to remind the House, however, of the 3-2 victory at Wembley in 1967. Just after England&#8217;s famous victory in the World cup, we beat them and, as a result, claimed our share of the Jules Rimet trophy. I have also suffered the trials and tribulations of a 5-1 defeat at Wembley, and vividly remember on the way back home the sign on the back of the bus on the M6 saying, &#8220;You couldnae make it 6&#8221;!</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/4">In football and rugby, we have a strong tradition of Scottish teams representing us on the world stage. Times are tough, and I dearly wish that our football and rugby performances were better at the present time, but we support our teams passionately through thick and thin. However, is it not ironic that many of the players exhibiting such passion for their national team, who live outwith Scotland but give their all for their chosen country, will not be able to vote in the forthcoming referendum. They are good enough to play for chosen country, but are not allowed to vote on Scotland&#8217;s future. That applies to many people who support Scotland vigorously, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/5">While in some sports we have full decision-making powers to select our own national teams on the world scene in football and rugby, in others we have Scottish representatives who make selections for UK teams. Nowhere was that more visible than the recent UK-held Olympics, and indeed the Paralympics, where we pooled our human resources and facilities to produce the best UK performance ever, with 55 out of 542 participants from Scotland taking part in 21 out of the 26 Olympic sports.</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/6">Did we not do well together and did not the Scots make an outstanding contribution to that success? There were individual golds for Sir Chris Hoy and Andy Murray, and an individual silver to Michael Jamieson&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/7">three individual highlights in a glittering array of success stories. Overall, team UK collectively won 65 individual awards at gold, silver and bronze. The sum total of medals for Scotland, however, was not three, but 14, as Scots teamed up with colleagues across the UK to achieve outstanding results, taking on the best that the world could offer&#8212;and winning!</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/8">What more apposite illustration could we have to sum up better together? Without the combined resources across the UK, 11 Scots would not have won these coveted Olympic medals. Scots were integral parts of team UK, and there was a collective passion and team spirit to work together, sharing training and coaching as well as facilities to produce the best Olympic results ever.</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/9">Some of our SNP colleagues have jumped on the bandwagon of UK success. <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">The hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase>, where I was brought up, proudly stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/10">&#8220;Britishness is one of our many identities and one that will be forever cherished in an independent Scotland.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/11">Yet the same hon. Gentleman has been recorded as saying:</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/12">&#8220;I do not even know what Britishness is&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="westminhall/2008-11-12.307"><i>Official Report,</i> 12 November 2008; Vol. 482, c. 307WH</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.432.2/13">Well, we do, and the Scots know of the many benefits that accrue from being British. This has been well illustrated so far in this debate across all aspects of British life. I am confident that on referendum day, the Scots will continue to see that things are best when we pull together and work with our neighbours, so we can spread the risks and share the rewards. I believe that Scots will see, as in our sports development, that we can still have the best of both worlds&#8212;teams representing Scotland, but participation in UK teams, too.</p>

It took him nine minutes to get to that point today, but I simply do not recognise what he is talking about when he speaks of a downtrodden nation seeking freedom. As a shadow Defence Minister, let me concentrate on defence and the defence of the nation as a whole.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/3">We are right in saying that Scots are rightly proud of our brave servicemen and women and the work they do across the world to keep us all safe. The British armed forces are the best and bravest in the world, and Scotland and the Scottish people are an integral part of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/4">The decision facing all Scots in the 2014 referendum is, in fact, a stark one: to continue to be part of the British Army, the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force and benefit from that safety and security, or to leave these services and go out on our own. After all we have been through together as a nation, why would we now want to go our separate ways and break away from the British armed forces?</p>
	<p pid="b.433.2/5">As well as the pride we feel in our armed forces and services, there are huge economic and employment benefits that Scotland&#8217;s leaving the UK would put at significant risk. There are 18,000 people employed in Scotland as either service personnel or Ministry of Defence civilian staff, with thousands more employed in the private sector as contractors and partners throughout Scotland.</p>

	<p pid="b.434.1/1">I am not giving way.</p>
	<p pid="b.434.1/2">Scotland&#8217;s largest work place is Her Majesty&#8217;s naval base on the Clyde, employing 6,500 people, and there is a work force 4,500 strong at the shipyards in Glasgow and Rosyth. Our shipbuilding industry and the jobs Scots have had in these yards for generations rely on the MOD for work. Scotland has a world-class defence industry and it is best protected by Scotland remaining in the UK. A separate Scotland would not be able to take advantage of UK contracts. About 40% of those UK defence contracts are non-competitively tendered within the UK; this means that they could not be extended to an independent Scotland. There would be no incentive for the remaining parts of the UK to outsource defence contracts to Scotland. For example, the Type 26 global combat ship is due to go into construction the year after the referendum, and the MOD has made it absolutely clear&#8212;a Defence Minister has said it twice here&#8212;that this contract will be open only to UK-based companies. We benefit from an MOD budget of &#163;35 billion a year&#8212;the fourth largest in the world. The SNP has stated that an independent Scottish Government would commit to an annual defence budget of around &#163;2.5 billion. This means that if a separate Scotland became part of NATO, it would have one of the lowest defence spends of any NATO country, at exactly the same time as our country would face massive transitional and new set-up costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.434.1/3">Professor Malcolm Chalmers, research director of the Royal United Services Institute, has said that the size of the Scottish defence procurement budget would be &#8220;pretty limited&#8221;, and he warns that much of Scotland&#8217;s defence industry would migrate southwards.</p>
	<p pid="b.434.1/4">The defence of our nation is of paramount importance, and it is hard to comprehend why the SNP, a political party predicated on separating Scotland from the UK, cannot answer some of the most basic questions about what defence policy in an independent Scotland would look like. <i>[Interruption.] </i>If there had been enough time and we did not have two votes ahead of us, perhaps SNP Members could have assisted us today by painting a picture of what the military might of a separate Scotland would look like. For the Army, how many</p>
	<p pid="b.434.1/5">regulars would there be, and how many reservists? Keeping in mind the fact that Scotland is surrounded by water on three sides, are we correct in assuming that Scotland would have a navy, and what would its strength be? Could we afford an air force? Would our military be in place to defend our borders, or would we be an expeditionary force?</p>

	<p pid="b.435.1/1">I am not giving way, because I am coming to my conclusion before we hear the winding-up speeches.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.1/2">There is a positive case for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom. No one doubts that our country is capable of being independent, but why should we want to lose all those advantages? At a time of immense and fast-evolving challenges throughout the world, with a plethora of security threats on the horizon, why on earth should we want to devote time and money to dividing our resources north and south of the border? We should be working together, throughout Britain, to remain vigilant against the constant threat of terrorism, combat the growing risk of cyber-crime, and prepare for the long-term security risks posed by climate change. Focusing on the defence of our nation, rather than plunging our country into uncertainty by splitting from the rest of the UK, is in Scotland&#8217;s national interest.</p>

	<p pid="b.435.2/1">Let me begin by paying tribute to the members of the Backbench Business Committee, and thanking them for enabling us to debate this important matter. We have had an excellent debate. I particularly appreciated the speech of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40249" name="Eleanor Laing">the hon. Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing)</phrase>, which demonstrated the warmth that Scots encounter throughout the rest of the United Kingdom, and the powerful speech of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40374" name="Graeme Morrice">the Member for Livingston (Graeme Morrice)</phrase>, who advanced clear economic arguments to demonstrate why Scotland works well when partnered with other nations in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.2/2">On the eve of St Andrew&#8217;s day, it is important for us to bear in mind that the UK Parliament is Scotland&#8217;s Parliament too. We have an opportunity to recognise the best that we have in Scotland and celebrate it, to pay tribute to our public sector service workers, and to appreciate the industry and effort that make Scotland so great in the cities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee, Aberdeen and, of course, many other places.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.2/3">We should also be pleased that Scotland is performing so significantly in the arts, in which I have a particular interest. As Vicky Featherstone leaves the great National Theatre of Scotland that she did so much to establish and goes to the Royal Court theatre, we mourn her loss and remember the contribution that she has made, but we are very proud that she is doing so well in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.2/4">What has been said today has clearly demonstrated the national pride that so many of us have in the great country of Scotland, but it also makes an important point that I hope will be remembered as we continue the debate on the referendum, namely that pride and patriotism in Scotland do not belong to a single political party.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.2/5">The national flag and our other symbols belong to us all. They do not belong to one person, or to one party. I hope that just because some of us disagree with the idea of separation, we will not be attacked for being anti-Scottish, and that such remarks are a thing of the past.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.2/6">Madam Deputy Presiding Officer&#8212;sorry, wrong Parliament! Many apologies, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am about to pay tribute to the work of the Scottish Parliament, which may be why I made that mistake.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.2/7">Let me begin by paying tribute to the late Member of Parliament for Glasgow, Anniesland, Donald Dewar, the first of Scotland&#8217;s First Ministers, who, in his inaugural address to the Parliament, spoke of</p>
	<p pid="b.435.2/8">&#8220;a new voice in the land&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.435.2/9">the voice of a democratic Parliament. Many of us were honoured to serve in that Parliament, which has proved to be very effective and strongly supported by the Scottish people.</p>
	<p pid="b.435.2/10">However, my argument, and the argument of the Labour party, has been and always will be that we are a party of devolution and believe in the great strength of devolution, but we are not a party of separation. We did not undertake our long, hard fight for devolution because we were obsessed with one constitutional arrangement over another; it was born out of a desire to see our system of government work in a way that would enhance the lives of people in the communities that we served. We saw the areas of life in which a Scottish Parliament could achieve more, but we also understood that, in the tradition of trade unionists and social reformers, the needs of the people could sometimes be met by our working together. A strong Scotland benefits the whole United Kingdom: that is the central theme of today&#8217;s debate. We can achieve more together than we can apart.</p>

	<p pid="b.436.0/1">The benefits of our remaining together are also demonstrated in the field of research in some of the world-class universities in Scotland. My own constituency contains universities that receive massive amounts of UK funding. That would clearly not be possible if we were separated. The academic sector provides another example of how well we can work together, and how much we would lose through separation.</p>

	<p pid="b.436.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend for making that point. I shall say more about that subject later. I think that many of the institutions that we share would lose a great deal if they were broken up, and academics are now beginning to flag up that concern themselves.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/2">The motion that we are discussing draws attention to the great contribution that Scotland has made to the development of the Union. We can be both proudly Scottish and British. As many Members have pointed out, that was demonstrated during the Olympic and Paralympic games in the summer. We saw clear evidence of a modern, multicultural Britain that forward-looking Scottish people can be part of and proud of. As a small island made up of distinctive nations, we can and should work together to ensure that opportunity is given to everyone.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/3">The institutions we have built up throughout the UK bear testimony to the work that we have undertaken in these islands together. As we heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40271" name="Anas Sarwar">the Member for Glasgow Central (Anas Sarwar)</phrase>, the</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/4">NHS was established by a Welshman, to the benefit of the whole UK. The welfare state was devised and implemented by an Englishman, to the benefit of the whole UK. The Labour party itself was established by a Scotsman working in an English, and then a Welsh, constituency, again&#8212;in my view&#8212;to the benefit of the whole UK.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/5">There is another form of union that operates throughout Britain and has grown out of shared British experience: the trade union movement of the United Kingdom, which symbolises the act of working together to improve and enhance the rights of working people. On the eve of St Andrew&#8217;s day, we should acknowledge all the work of the trade unions in Scotland&#8212;along with their friends in Wales and England&#8212;to improve the conditions of working people throughout our countries. I would not want to put that at risk as we move towards separation.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/6">Together, we created throughout Britain the institutions that were needed to meet the challenges of the time, from the trade unions to the welfare state to the Scottish Parliament and, indeed, the Welsh and Irish national Assemblies. Now we must again look to the challenges of the modern time, and look at the paths that lie before us. Do we continue with devolution, as a strong Scotland in partnership with the United Kingdom, or do we opt for separation&#8212;for pulling away from our allies? The threats posed by the latter option have been described in detail during the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/7">The debate about the future of Scotland is now well under way. If the past few months are anything to go by, it will certainly be a lively debate: the Scottish people will expect nothing less. As things stand, however, we face a raft of unanswered questions about the prospect of separation. I am told that Dundee university called its academic study of independence &#8220;Five Million Questions&#8221;. Let me focus on just one or two of those questions.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/8">Before a decision is made on the future of Scotland, the Scots making that decision require more detail in the debate. What will separation mean for Scottish mortgages or Scottish interest rates? What will happen to our pensions, and what about our family tax credits? How can we avoid a race to the bottom when it comes to levels of tax, wages and financial support? Those are the real questions that will determine the outcome of the referendum, and which really concern citizens, families, trade unions and businesses. However, I have to say that the SNP has so far failed to confront and failed to answer them.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/9">Scotland has a better future. We are only beginning to see the promise of devolution which Labour Members put into practice, and which we want to see continue and flourish in Scotland. Scotland can be a strong partner, working within a strong United Kingdom. That is the case that we will continue to argue&#8212;and make no mistake: if Scots vote for separation, it will be the end of devolution. We will make the case for Britain with passion and energy.</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/10">This debate has highlighted the great strength of Scotland and the great strength of the Union, and what has been achieved by that. We have heard the history of how we have shared the risks and rewards, the resources and the opportunities. We must continue to do so in the future. This is not just about the successes of the past; it</p>
	<p pid="b.436.1/11">is about our prospects for the future. A time of increasing interdependence in the world is not a time for narrow nationalism, but a time for us to work better together for a stronger Scotland and a stronger Union.</p>

	<p pid="b.438.0/1">May I begin by passing my best wishes and those of the Secretary of State to <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40215" name="Stewart Hosie">the hon. Member for Dundee East (Stewart Hosie)</phrase>? We wish him a speedy recovery. That is the only matter on which there is likely to be agreement with the SNP this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.0/2">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40249" name="Eleanor Laing">the Member for Epping Forest (Mrs Laing)</phrase> on securing the debate. She is a proud Scot, as is my hon.

I entirely repudiate the sentiment implicit in the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40478" name="Pete Wishart">the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart)</phrase>, that somehow only supporters of the nationalist cause can care about Scotland, be proud of Scotland, or make the case for Scotland. That is absolutely not the case.</p>

	<p pid="b.438.1/1">I never made any such claim; everybody here is a proud Scot, and I said no such thing. The SNP has managed to get just one 10-minute speech in a three-hour debate. We have heard one side of the case&#8212;<i>[Interruption.] </i>We should have more time. <i>[Interruption.] </i>Even now I am being shouted down. Surely in this debate the SNP should have got more time than we have been allowed today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-29b.438.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40214" speakername="David Mundell" colnum="438"  time="014:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121129/debtext/121129-0003.htm#12112958002206">
	<p pid="b.438.2/1">I am not an expert on procedure, but I understand this debate is being curtailed because the SNP is going to force two Divisions. That is simply a stunt, and those of us who are involved in Scottish politics are very familiar with the SNP preferring to pull stunts than talk about the issues of the day.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.2/2">I particularly want to thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40069" name="Nigel Dodds">the right hon. Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds)</phrase> for his excellent speech. It is heartening to hear Members from other parts of the United Kingdom state how much importance they place on Scotland remaining in the UK. As he said, the whole of the United Kingdom would be the poorer if Scotland left.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.2/3">In 2014, people in Scotland will face their most important political decision in 300 years. A vote for independence in the referendum of that year is not just for Christmas 2014; it is for life. As the motion states:</p>
	<p pid="b.438.2/4">&#8220;Scotland has always made, and continues to make, a significant contribution to the UK over the 305 years of the Union&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.2/5">The Government believe that Scotland is stronger within the United Kingdom, which Scotland helped to shape, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40275" name="John Robertson">the hon. Member for Glasgow North West (John Robertson)</phrase> said, but we also recognise that the biggest constitutional question of all needs to be settled once and for all. That is why Scotland&#8217;s two Governments worked together constructively to reach an agreement on the referendum process. Regardless of the result, that constructive relationship will of course continue as we move forward. That does not mean that in the unlikely event of a yes vote, the remaining UK would facilitate Scotland&#8217;s every wish, any more than an independent Scotland would unquestioningly facilitate the wishes of the remaining UK. Inevitably&#8212;although some have sought to deny it today&#8212;there would be two</p>
	<p pid="b.438.2/6">separate countries and therefore two sets of interests, sometimes mutual, sometimes at odds, as is currently the case with our closest international allies and as will always be the case between separate, sovereign states.</p>
	<p pid="b.438.2/7">The SNP likes to talk about partnership and about neighbours working together. These days, it even likes to talk about us all being British, even though the hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire told us previously he did not know what Britishness was and had never felt British in his life. You couldn&#8217;t make it up, but the SNP does. As the hon. Member for Glasgow North West highlighted, the SNP amendment even pretends that it can wrench Scotland out of the UK and nothing will have changed. Do not be fooled: working together is what the United Kingdom is all about, but the SNP wants to break it up. Partnership is what the United Kingdom is all about, but the SNP wants to rip it up. If Scotland votes for independence in 2014, it will leave the United Kingdom&#8212;leave all that we have achieved together over the past 300 years and all that we will continue to achieve by remaining together.</p>

	<p pid="b.439.0/1">The credibility of the First Minister has been a central issue in this debate. What does the Minister make of Justice Leveson&#8217;s finding on the First Minister&#8217;s attempt to lobby on behalf of Sky and the possibility that that might have rendered the Government&#8217;s decision on the Sky issue unlawful?</p>

	<p pid="b.439.1/1">I do not find that surprising. On several recent occasions the First Minister has been brought before the Scottish Parliament to explain things he has said that have been found to be untrue.</p>
	<p pid="b.439.1/2">By putting together the various aspects of the debate&#8212;the economics, the international influence question, the fact that we Scots helped to make this United Kingdom &#8212;we get a compelling case for Scotland remaining in the UK, and many Members have made that case today. The UK Government are looking forward to making the positive case for Scotland within the United Kingdom. Today we have shown why twice as many Scots want to remain in the UK than support independence. They are people who know the difference between patriotism and nationalism; people who know, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40272" name="Margaret Curran">the hon. Member for Glasgow East (Margaret Curran)</phrase> said, that the saltire is a symbol of our nation, not of nationalism; people who know that being Scottish and British is not a contradiction but is the best of both worlds, whereas the SNP wants to take our Britishness away from us; people who know that Scotland helps put the &#8220;Great&#8221; into Great Britain and make our Kingdom united&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.439.4/1">Yesterday I had the privilege to attend the launch of the green investment bank in Edinburgh. It is supported by all parties, including the SNP, and it is a wonderful example of the UK working together. It is the UK green investment bank, and it is hard to see how it could have been headquartered in Edinburgh if Edinburgh had been in a separate state.</p>

	<p pid="b.440.0/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a good point about the positive benefits that flow to Scotland from remaining part of the UK, and about the positive benefits the UK gets from Scotland&#8217;s expertise in financial services, which was one of the key reasons that led to the green investment bank being headquartered in Edinburgh.</p>
	<p pid="b.440.0/2">This has been a heated debate, as such debates always are, for the topic is very important to the people of Scotland and the people of the rest of the United Kingdom. I believe that people, including me, who know in their bones that we are better together will deliver the result Scotland and the United Kingdom wants in the referendum in 2014. We do not fear the debate to come; we welcome it&#8212;and we would have liked this afternoon&#8217;s debate to have been a little longer, rather than its being curtailed by having two meaningless votes.</p>

As the argument is advanced in the country as a whole over the next two years, it will be won in the hearts as well as the heads of the people&#8212;not only the people who will have the privilege of a vote, but everyone else, who will take part in the debate and have their voices heard throughout the whole of our United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.440.3/2">As far as heads are concerned, we have heard some good facts and figures this afternoon, and I hope that they will be repeated over and again so that people with a vote in the referendum understand the reality of what separation would mean for Scotland and the whole United Kingdom. As far as hearts are concerned, I turn, as ever, to Robert Burns, who wrote in the most powerful verse of his excellent poem &#8220;The Dumfries Volunteers&#8221;:</p>

	Leveson Inquiry
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-29b.446.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40665" speakername="David Cameron" speakeroffice="The Prime Minister"  colnum="446"  time="015:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121129/debtext/121129-0003.htm#12112958002878">
	<p pid="b.446.1/1">With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a statement on today&#8217;s report from Lord Justice Leveson. As we consider the report, we should consider the victims. We should remember how the parents of Milly Dowler, at their most vulnerable moment, had their daughter&#8217;s phone hacked and were followed and photographed, how Christopher Jefferies&#8217; reputation was destroyed by false accusations, how the mother of Madeleine McCann, Kate, had her private diary printed without her permission and how she and her husband were falsely accused of keeping their daughter&#8217;s body in their freezer. These victims, and many other innocent people who have never sought the limelight, have suffered in a way that we can barely begin to imagine.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/2">That is why last summer I asked Lord Justice Leveson to lead an independent inquiry. It had the power to see any document and summon any witness to be examined under oath by a barrister in public. It has been, as Lord Justice Leveson says,</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/3">&#8220;the most public and the most concentrated look at the press that this country has seen.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/4">I would like to thank Lord Justice Leveson and his entire team for the work they have undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/5">Lord Justice Leveson makes findings and recommendations in three areas: on the relationship between the press and the police; on the relationship between the press and politicians; and on the relationship between the press and the public. Let me take each in turn.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/6">First, on the press and the police, Lord Justice Leveson makes it clear that he does not find a basis for challenging the integrity of the police, but he does raise a number of areas that he felt were a cause for public concern, such as tip-offs, off-the-record briefings and, more broadly, &#8220;excessive proximity&#8221; between the press and the police. He makes a number of recommendations, including: national guidance on appropriate gifts and hospitality; record-keeping of contact between very senior police officers and journalists; and a 12-month &#8220;cooling-off&#8221; period for senior police officers being employed by the press. These recommendations are designed to break the perception of an excessively cosy relationship between the press and the police, and we support them.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/7">When I set up the inquiry, I also said that there would be a second part to investigate wrongdoing in the press and the police, including the conduct of the first police investigation. That second stage cannot go ahead until the current criminal proceedings have concluded, but we remain committed to the inquiry as it was first established.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/8">Next, on the relationship between politicians and the media, as Lord Justice Leveson has found,</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/9">&#8220;over the last 30-35 years and probably much longer, the political parties of UK national Government and of UK official Opposition, have had or developed too close a relationship with the press in a way which has not been in the public interest.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/10">I made that point last summer when I set up the inquiry, and at the same time I set in train reforms to improve transparency. We are the first Government ever to publish details of meetings between senior politicians and proprietors, editors or senior executives, as Lord Justice</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/11">Leveson recommends in his report. He also recommends disclosing further information on the overall level of interaction between politicians and the press. That would apply to all parties, and on the Government&#8217;s behalf I can say that we accept the recommendation.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/12">During the course of the inquiry a number of serious allegations were made. I want to deal with them directly. First, it was alleged that my party struck a deal with News International. That allegation was repeated again and again on the Floor of this House and at the inquiry itself. Lord Justice Leveson looked at this in detail and rejected the allegation emphatically. Let me read his conclusion:</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/13">&#8220;The evidence does not, of course, establish anything resembling a &#8216;deal&#8217; whereby News International&#8217;s support was traded for the expectation of policy favours.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/14">Those who repeatedly made these allegations, including Members of this House and the former Prime Minister, should now acknowledge that they were wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/15">Secondly, it was alleged that I gave my right hon. Friend, the then Culture Secretary, now the Health Secretary, the responsibility of handling the BSkyB bid in order to fix the outcome. Lord Justice Leveson states clearly that</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/16">&#8220;the evidence does not begin to support a conclusion that the choice of Mr Hunt was the product of improper media pressure...still less an attempt to guarantee a particular outcome to the process&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/17">another allegation repeatedly made, and again shown to be wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/18">Thirdly, there was the criticism that the then Culture Secretary had rigged the handling of the BSkyB bid. Again, today&#8217;s report rejects that as well. My right hon. Friend, it says,</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/19">&#8220;put in place robust systems to ensure that the remaining stages of the bid would be handled with fairness, impartiality and transparency&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/20">Indeed, Lord Justice Leveson goes further, concluding that my right hon. Friend&#8217;s</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/21">&#8220;extensive reliance on external advice...was a wise and effective means of helping him to keep to the statutory test&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/22">He concludes that</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/23">&#8220;there is no credible evidence of actual bias&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/24">Of course, as my right hon. Friend has said, there are lessons to learn about how quasi-judicial decisions are made, and we must learn those lessons. But let me say this: my right hon. Friend, now the Health Secretary, has endured a stream of allegations with great dignity. This report confirms something that we on this side of the House knew all along&#8212;we were right to stand by him. Let me also say this: Lord Justice Leveson finds in respect of my right hon. Friend the Business Secretary that he</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/25">&#8220;acted with scrupulous care and impartiality&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/26">Next, and most important of all, let me turn to what Lord Justice Leveson says about the relationship between the press and the public. As he says very clearly, even after 16 months of this inquiry, he remains</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/27">&#8220;firmly of the belief that the British press&#8212;all of it&#8212;serves the country very well for the vast majority of the time.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/28">But on the culture, practices and ethics of some in the press, his words are very stark. He finds that</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/29">&#8220;there have been too many times when, chasing the story, parts of the press have acted as if its own code, which it wrote, simply did not exist.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/30">He cites</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/31">&#8220;press behaviour that, at times, can only be described as outrageous.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/32">He catalogues a number of examples of such behaviour, going wider than phone hacking. He refers to</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/33">&#8220;a recklessness in prioritising sensational stories, almost irrespective of the harm that the stories may cause and the rights of those who would be affected&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/34">He finds that</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/35">&#8220;when the story is just too big and the public appetite too great, there has been significant and reckless disregard for accuracy.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/36">And he reports</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/37">&#8220;a cultural tendency within parts of the press vigorously to resist or dismiss complainants almost as a matter of course.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/38">In a free society, the press are subject to criminal law, civil law and requirements for data protection, but there should be a proper regulatory system as well to ensure that standards are upheld, complaints are heard, and there is proper redress for those who have been wronged. That is what the current system should have delivered. It has not. As Lord Justice Leveson says, the Press Complaints Commission is</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/39">&#8220;neither a regulator, nor fit for purpose to fulfil that responsibility.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/40">That is why changes are urgently needed. We welcome the fact that the press industry itself has put forward its own proposals for a new system of regulation, but we agree with Lord Justice Leveson that these proposals do not yet go far enough.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/41">In volume IV of the report, Lord Justice Leveson sets out proposals for independent self-regulation organised by the media. He details the key &#8220;requirements&#8221; that an independent self-regulatory body should meet, including independence of appointments and funding, a standards code, an arbitration service, and a speedy complaint-handling mechanism. Crucially, it must have the power to demand up-front, prominent apologies and impose up to million-pound fines. These are the Leveson principles. They are the central recommendations of the report. If they can be put in place, we truly will have a regulatory system that delivers public confidence, justice for the victims, and a step change in the way the press is regulated in our country. I accept these principles, and I hope that the whole House will come in behind them. The onus should now be on the press to implement them&#8212;and implement them radically.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/42">In support of this, Lord Justice Leveson makes some important proposals. First, he proposes some changes to the Data Protection Act that would reduce the special treatment that journalists are afforded when dealing with personal data. We must consider this very carefully, particularly the impact that it could have on investigative journalism. Although I have been able to make only preliminary investigations about that proposal since reading the report, I am instinctively concerned about it.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/43">Secondly, Lord Leveson proposes changes to establish a system of incentives for each newspaper to take part in the system of independent regulation. I agree that there should be incentives and believe that those he sets out, such as the award of costs and exemplary damages in litigation, could be effective. He goes on to propose legislation that would help to deliver those incentives and, crucially, that would provide</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/44">&#8220;an independent process to recognise the new self-regulatory body&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/45">That would, he says,</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/46">&#8220;reassure the public that the basic requirements of independence and effectiveness were met and continue to be met.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/47">I have some serious concerns and misgivings on that recommendation. They break down into issues of principle, practicality and necessity.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/48">The issue of principle is that, for the first time, we would have crossed the Rubicon of writing elements of press regulation into the law of the land. We should be wary of any legislation that has the potential to infringe free speech and a free press. In this House, which has been a bulwark of democracy for centuries, we should think very, very carefully before crossing that line.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/49">On the grounds of practicality, no matter how simple the intention of the new law, the legislation required to underpin the regulatory body would be more complicated. Paragraphs 71 and 72 of the executive summary begin to set out what would be needed in the legislation, which would, for example, validate the standards code and recognise the powers of the new body. Page 1772 in volume IV of the full report says that the new law</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/50">&#8220;must identify those legitimate requirements and provide a mechanism to recognise and certify that a new body meets them.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/51">The danger is that that would create a vehicle for politicians, whether today or some time in the future, to impose regulation and obligations on the press&#8212;something that Lord Justice Leveson himself wishes to avoid.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/52">Thirdly, on the grounds of necessity, I am not convinced at this stage that statute is necessary to achieve Lord Justice Leveson&#8217;s objectives. I believe that there may be alternative options for putting in place incentives, providing reassurance to the public and ensuring that the Leveson principles of regulation are put in place. Those options should be explored.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/53">These questions, including those about data protection, are fundamental questions that we must resolve. I have therefore invited the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition to join me in cross-party talks, starting immediately after this statement. But let me be clear: a regulatory system that complies with the Leveson principles should be put in place rapidly. I favour giving the press a limited period of time in which to do that. They do not need to wait for all the other elements of Lord Justice Leveson&#8217;s report to be implemented. While no one wants to see full statutory regulation, let me stress that the status quo is not an option. Be in no doubt: we should be determined to see Lord Justice Leveson&#8217;s principles implemented.</p>
	<p pid="b.446.1/54">There is much that we in this country can be proud of: the oldest democracy in the world; freedom of speech; a free press; frank and healthy public debate. But this report lays bare that the system of press regulation that we have is badly broken and has let down victims badly. Our responsibility is to fix it. The task for us now is to build a new system of press regulation that supports our great traditions of investigative journalism and free speech, that protects the rights of the vulnerable and the innocent, and that commands the confidence of the whole country. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.449.0/1">May I start by thanking the Prime Minister for his statement? May I say straight away that in the days and weeks ahead</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/2">I will seek to convince him and this House of Commons that we should put our faith in the recommendations of Lord Justice Leveson that were delivered to us today? I am sorry that the Prime Minister is not yet there, but I hope to convince him over the days ahead that that is where we should go. We should put our trust in Lord Justice Leveson&#8217;s recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/3">Let me begin by paying tribute to and thanking Lord Justice Leveson and his team for the painstaking, impartial and comprehensive way in which they conducted the inquiry. I thank Lord Justice Leveson for the clarity with which he has explained his report today.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/4">Most of all, I want to join the Prime Minister in paying tribute to the innocent victims who gave evidence to the inquiry: people who did not seek to be in the public eye, who suffered deep loss and grief, and who then faced further trauma at the hands of the press. It is easy to forget, but without the revelations last July about what happened to Bob and Sally Dowler, and to their daughter, and their courage in speaking out, we would not be here today. Gerry and Kate McCann suffered so much and showed much courage. Kate McCann, whose daughter remains missing, saw her private diary published by the<i>News of the World</i> for the sake of a story. Those people gave evidence to the inquiry to serve the wider public interest, and I am sure the whole House pays tribute to their courage. They must be at the forefront of our minds today.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/5">Much has been written about the reasons for this inquiry. A free press is essential to a functioning democracy, and the press must be able to hold the powerful&#8212;especially us politicians&#8212;to account without fear or favour. That is part of the character of our country. At the same time, however, I do not want to live in a country where innocent families such as the McCanns and the Dowlers can see their lives torn apart simply for the sake of profit, and where powerful interests in the press know they will not be held to account. This is about the character of our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/6">It turns out that there never was just one &#8220;rogue reporter&#8221;. Lord Justice Leveson concludes that a whole range of practices, from phone hacking to covert surveillance, harassment and other wrongful behaviour were widespread and in breach of the code by which the press was supposed to abide. I recognise the many decent people who work for our country&#8217;s newspapers, and not every newspaper did wrong. However, Lord Justice Leveson concludes that</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/7">&#8220;it is argued that these are aberrations and do not reflect on the culture, practices or ethics of the press as a whole. I wholly reject this analysis.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/8">That will not come as a surprise to many people, including Members of this House. Lord Justice Leveson also concludes that there has been by politicians</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/9">&#8220;a persistent failure to respond...to public concern about the culture, practices and ethics of the press&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/10">We must all take responsibility for that, and the publication of this report marks the moment we must put that right by upholding the freedom of the press and guaranteeing protection and redress for the citizen. As the Prime Minister himself rightly said at the Leveson inquiry:</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/11">&#8220;If the families like the Dowlers feel this has really changed the way they would have been treated, we would have done our job properly.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/12">I agree.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/13">Let us be clear about Lord Justice Leveson&#8217;s proposals, why they differ from the present system, and why I believe they should be accepted in their entirety. He proposes:</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/14">&#8220;A genuinely independent regulator, with effective powers to protect and provide redress for the victims of abuse.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/15">He also gives responsibility for establishing that system to the press, as now. That is why statute is important.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/16">Lord Justice Leveson provides a crucial new guarantee that we have never had before. He recommends that the media regulator, Ofcom, ensure that any system that is established passes the test we would all want applied&#8212;that it is truly independent and provides effective protection for people such as the McCanns and the Dowlers. To make that guarantee real, he recommends that both Ofcom&#8217;s role and the criteria of independence and effectiveness be set out in statute&#8212;a law of this Parliament. That is why we can get to truly independent regulation of the press, guaranteed by law.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/17">I believe that Lord Justice Leveson&#8217;s proposals are measured, reasonable and proportionate, and Labour Members unequivocally endorse the principles set out and his central recommendations. We support the view that Ofcom is the right body for the task of recognition of the new regulator, and the proposal that the House should lay the role of Ofcom down in statute. We endorse the proposal that the criteria any new regulatory body must meet should be set out in statute. Without that, there cannot be the change we need. Lord Justice Leveson is 100% clear on that in his report.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/18">Lord Justice Leveson has, I believe, made every effort to meet the concerns of the industry. Some people will say that this report does not go far enough or that the reforms will not work because the press will not co-operate. I believe that the press has a major responsibility to come forward and show it will co-operate with this system&#8212;a comprehensive reform of the kind proposed by Lord Justice Leveson.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/19">Lord Justice Leveson also says that if we cannot achieve a comprehensive system involving all major newspapers, we should go to the necessary alternative: direct statutory regulation. I believe that Lord Justice Leveson has genuinely listened to what the press has said, and acted with the utmost responsibility. Editors and proprietors should now do the same. I believe that Lord Justice Leveson has genuinely listened to what the press have said and acted with the utmost responsibility. Editors and proprietors should now do the same.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/20">Let me also say&#8212;the Prime Minister did not touch on this&#8212;that Lord Justice Leveson also reaches important conclusions on the need to prevent too much influence in the media from ending up in one pair of hands. He proposes that there should be continuous scrutiny of the degree of media plurality and a lower cap than that currently provided by competition law. When the Prime Minister gets up to reply, will he take that forward?</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/21">As the Prime Minister said, Lord Justice Leveson makes specific suggestions on greater transparency on meetings and contacts between politicians and the press. He says that that should be considered as an immediate need. I agree, and endorse the proposals, as the Prime Minister did.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/22">I welcome the Prime Minister&#8217;s offer of immediate cross-party talks on the implementation of the recommendations, and I am grateful for the conversations we have already had, but the talks must be about</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/23">implementing the recommendations, not whether we implement them. In the talks, I want to agree a swift timetable for the implementation of the proposals. I want us to agree to legislate in the next Session of Parliament, starting in May 2013, and to have a new system up and running by the end of this Parliament&#8212;meaning 2015 at the latest. By the end of January next year, we should have an opportunity&#8212;the Opposition will make this happen if necessary&#8212;for the House to endorse and proceed with the Leveson proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/24">We should and we can move forward together&#8212;wholeheartedly, now. We have 70 years and seven reports that have gone nowhere. Now is the time to act. Let me remind the House what David Waddington, then Home Secretary, said 20 years ago:</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/25">&#8220;This is positively the last chance for the industry to establish an effective non-statutory system of regulation&#8221;.&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/1990-06-21.1126"><i>Official Report</i>, 21 June 1990; Vol. 174, c. 1126</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/26">The case is compelling and the evidence is overwhelming. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make change that the public can trust. There can be no more last-chance saloons.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/27">In acting, let us remember the words of Bob and Sally Dowler at Leveson:</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/28">&#8220;there is nothing that can rectify the damage that has been done to our family. All that we can hope for is a positive outcome from this Inquiry so that other families are not affected in the way we have been&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.449.0/29">On behalf of every decent British citizen who wants protection for people such as the Dowlers and a truly free press&#8212;a press that can expose abuse of power without abusing its own&#8212;we must act.</p>

	<p pid="b.452.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his response. He is absolutely right to thank Leveson for the work he has done and the report he has produced. The right hon. Gentleman is also right to talk about the innocent victims and the enormous courage they have shown by appearing in front of the inquiry and telling their stories. He was also right to mention Leveson&#8217;s finding that all politicians, going back over decades, must take responsibility for a relationship between politicians and the press that got too close.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/2">Let me make a couple of the points on some of the things the right hon. Gentleman said. I note he said he strongly supports Ofcom carrying out the test of whether the regulatory system was compliant. That is something we need to look at in the cross-party discussions, because, however we go about this, it is important that we demonstrate the real independence of this regulatory system. Of course, the chair of Ofcom is appointed by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. We have to think about that, but we also have to consider that Ofcom is already a very powerful regulatory body. We should be trying to reduce concentrations of power rather than increase them. That is something we might want to discuss.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/3">One issue the right hon. Gentleman did not address&#8212;I hope we can address it in the cross-party conversations&#8212;is data protection law changes. We should not respond in too rapid a way to something as complex as that. We do not want to put in place something that wrecks proper investigative journalism in our country.</p>
	<p pid="b.452.0/4">On statutory regulation, I would make the point to the right hon. Gentleman that Leveson rightly rejects statutory regulation and says that we must move from the status quo and implement the principles of the report. I agree&#8212;that is absolutely vital. We do not want to be left in the position of having only statutory regulation as the alternative to the proposals he sets out. I completely agree with the right hon. Gentleman that the talks should be business-like and that we should get on with them, but where I disagree with him is that we do not have to wait until those discussions are had to implement the report. The report needs to be implemented by the press taking the steps set out in the report to put in place the independent regulation that Leveson speaks about. They could start that right now.</p>

	<p pid="b.453.2/1">Did Lord Justice Leveson make any comments on the proprietorship of newspapers? Surely, one factor in the depression of press standards is that some owners of national newspapers have been bad men and sometimes foreigners with an ingrained hostility towards Britain, and their editors know that they can only keep their jobs by achieving the required levels of readership and advertising revenue by populist sensationalism, however immoral. Should ownership of British newspapers be confined to British nationals who are judged to be fit and proper for that role, as with television?</p>

	<p pid="b.453.3/1">The report goes into enormous detail about the history and ownership of the press. Part of one of the volumes goes into immense detail, which my right hon. Friend can study, and perhaps that is the best answer to him. This point was raised by the Leader of the Opposition. Lord Justice Leveson does address concerns about plurality and media ownership and does say we need to make sure there is more plurality than would otherwise be guaranteed simply by competition policy. That is important, because we want to have not just a vigorous press, but a press that is in different&#8212;in wide&#8212;ownership as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.453.4/1">Does the Prime Minister not, however, appreciate that the argument made by Lord Leveson is not, as he says, for statutory regulation, which is not there, but in order to enforce and give backing to the proposals of the press? The fundamental flaw with the proposals of the press, as Lord Leveson clearly sets out, is not their intention, which I acknowledge is now an honourable one, but that it is impossible to deliver the independence proposed by the press themselves and the enforcement&#8212;for example, not least on penalties on legal costs&#8212;without some overarching form of statutory backing? It is not regulation&#8212;it is statutory backing. I plead with the Prime Minister to recognise the force of the argument, not that I am making, but that Lord Leveson makes.</p>

	<p pid="b.454.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman is entirely right that Lord Justice Leveson is not recommending statutory regulation of the press. He wants to take steps so that we avoid statutory regulation of the press&#8212;I fully respect that. But in answer to his point, the system Lord Justice Leveson recommends is not a compulsory system. It does not guarantee that everyone takes part; it is still a voluntary system. Where we are in complete agreement is that Lord Justice Leveson does not want statutory regulation&#8212;neither do I. Lord Justice Leveson wants strong, independent regulation&#8212;that is what I want. He sets out the principles of strong, independent regulation&#8212;that is what we have got to put in place, and that is what the press should start to put in place straight away.</p>

	<p pid="b.454.1/1">The central requirement is a press complaints procedure that will not only be fully independent, but will restore public confidence. I ask the Prime Minister to look very objectively at the case as to whether an Act of Parliament would indeed enhance that credibility. I refer him in particular to paragraph 72 of the executive summary of the report, where Lord Leveson states that an Act of Parliament would</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/2">&#8220;reassure the public that the basic requirements of independence and effectiveness were met and continued to be met&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.454.1/3">I believe that that is a very powerful argument, and I ask my right hon. Friend to consider it with all force.</p>

	<p pid="b.454.2/1">My right hon. and learned Friend is absolutely right&#8212;paragraphs 70, 71 and 72 are the absolutely key paragraphs of the report. But let me explain why I have misgivings about leaping straight to that conclusion. Once we start writing a piece of legislation that backs up an independent regulator, we have to write into that legislation what is its composition, what are its powers, what is its make-up, and we find pretty soon&#8212;I would worry&#8212;that we have a piece of law that really is a piece of press regulatory law. Now, that is an enormous step for us in this House of Commons to take, and we have to think about it very carefully before we leap into this new approach.</p>

	<p pid="b.454.3/1">Does the Prime Minister not accept that, if he wants people to accept the report&#8217;s recommendations and conclusions generally, particularly the ones he likes, he cannot pick and choose, but should accept all the recommendations?</p>

	<p pid="b.454.4/1">This is where I part company with the right hon. Gentleman: it is the job of the House of Commons to consider a report and what is right for this country to introduce. I highlighted the issue of the changes to the Data Protection Act because I was advised that they could have a serious effect on investigative journalism. It would be quite wrong, if we received a report of this magnitude and said in five minutes flat, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to implement every last piece of it&#8221;, without considering the consequences. A responsible Government will think about the consequences. I am absolutely clear, however, that the clear principles of Leveson-style regulation&#8212;on what the independent press regulator needs&#8212;are right.</p>

	<p pid="b.455.0/1">This is absolutely the key argument that has to be had in our cross-party discussions. Lord Leveson is saying that the statutory underpinning is necessary properly to give effect to this independent body. Of course, he intends it to be a very neat, very small piece of statute, but paragraph 71, for instance, states that the law would not</p>
	<p pid="b.455.0/2">&#8220;give any rights to these entities&#8230;except insofar as it would require the recognised self-regulatory body to have the power to direct the placement and prominence or corrections and apologies.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.455.0/3">Once we try&#8212;and we have tried it&#8212;writing a law that provides for statutory underpinning that describes what the regulatory authority does, what powers it has and how it is made up, we soon find we have quite a big piece of law. That is the concern. We need to think very carefully before crossing that Rubicon.</p>

	<p pid="b.455.1/1">How, without the statutory underpinning that Lord Leveson says is essential, does the Prime Minister think a new body could prevent a newspaper group simply from walking away or ignoring the new body&#8217;s findings?</p>

	<p pid="b.455.3/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is now almost universal agreement that we must have a strong new regulator, that it must be seen to be independent and that it must be established as quickly as possible? I strongly welcome his statement, however, that the question of whether the regulator should have statutory underpinning is something that Parliament needs to consider carefully, perhaps through a regular assessment of its effectiveness by the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, and that we should proceed to legislate only if it becomes absolutely clear that it will not function properly without it.</p>

	<p pid="b.455.4/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point. He has probably spent more time looking at this issue than almost any other Member of the House of Commons. As he said, what matters is the enormous consensus about what independent regulation should consist of, including the powers that are necessary. We all know we need million-pound fines, proper investigations, editors held to account and prominent apologies. That is what victims deserve and what we must put in place, but he is right that we need to think carefully before we pass legislation in the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.455.5/1">In his responses so far, the Prime Minister is splitting the House. This is not what the public expect of us.

	<p pid="b.456.1/1">May I for one welcome wholeheartedly the Prime Minister&#8217;s caution about using statute in this matter? I remind him that it was not a policeman, a regulator or even a judge who highlighted the hacking scandal; it was a member of our free press. As such, one of our highest priorities is to ensure that whatever we do preserves the independence and freedom of our press from Government intervention, because that is the best bastion of our freedoms.</p>

	<p pid="b.456.2/1">My right hon. Friend makes an important point. We have to get this right. It is very important that the regulation is put in place rapidly.

We absolutely support the absolute freedom of the press&#8212;there can be no statutory regulation of the press&#8212;but there needs to be proper redress for those who are wronged. The Prime Minister says he wants to think again about Leveson&#8217;s recommendations on statutory legislation. He talks about alternative options. Can he give us a flavour of what those options might be? There is a feeling among some that this may be more to do with party management than really dealing with the problems.</p>

	<p pid="b.456.4/1">There is a variety of opinions right across the House. We have to be frank about this. I think it is important to consider the very big step of effectively passing statute on the press in this country. There are many independent non-statutory bodies in this country of very long standing. The real test is not whether this body is backed by statute or not; the real test is: can it fine newspapers? Can it call editors to account? Can it get front-page apologies? That is what people want to know and that is what we need to deliver.</p>

We are not being asked by Leveson to cross a Rubicon&#8212;barely even a brook.

	<p pid="b.456.6/2">and asking whether we want to have legislation of that extent on our statute book&#8212;which of course could then be amended at any moment, by any politician at any future point. That is an important consideration.</p>

Lord Leveson reserves his strongest condemnation for the political class in this country, because he believes that over years&#8212;because we have been too compromised, too craven or too cowardly&#8212;we have refused to act. We now have an independent figure telling us what to do. Surely if we do not do what he says, which is to provide a change in the law, there will be more Millie Dowlers, and that will be our fault.</p>

	<p pid="b.457.1/1">I would also argue that one of the other problems with the political class is never saying sorry when they get it wrong. On <phrase class="date" code="2012-11-13">13 November 2012</phrase>, the hon. Gentleman spoke about the</p>

	<p pid="b.458.4/1">The two scandals that gave rise to this inquiry were phone hacking and bribing the police, both of which are against the criminal law. Now, some 90 arrests have been made. Strangely, however, Lord Leveson concludes:</p>
	<p pid="b.458.4/2">&#8220;More rigorous application of the criminal law&#8230;does not and will not provide the solution.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.458.4/3">Instead he goes off on building proposals for what would ultimately be statutorily underpinned regulation, which is largely irrelevant to what has happened. I congratulate my right hon. Friend on not going down that route, as that would not solve the problems that gave rise to the inquiry.</p>

	<p pid="b.458.5/1">I am grateful for my right hon. Friend&#8217;s support. I would, however, make the point that, while the press must always act within the law&#8212;they are subject to the criminal law, the civil law and the laws on data protection, and that is vitally important&#8212;there is also a role for strong, independent regulation. Those victims should not have had to wait for action through civil litigation, and they should not have had to wait until the criminal actions were taken. A proper regulatory system could have protected more of those people and prevented many more of them from becoming victims in the first place.</p>

Will he take this opportunity to welcome the proposal by the First Minister that, in addition to a full debate on this question in the Scottish Parliament, there should be cross-party discussions and an independent implementation group, chaired by a Court of Session judge, which should consider how best to implement Lord Leveson&#8217;s proposals in the context of Scots law and the devolved responsibilities of the Scottish Parliament?</p>

	<p pid="b.459.2/1">I agree with some of what my hon. Friend says, but it is important that we lay down very clearly what is expected of the press in terms of the independent regulatory system that needs to be put in place. What we cannot have is a continuation of the status quo; we need a proper investigative arm of a regulatory body, which needs to be able to levy fines, to insist on apologies and to be far more independent than it has been up to now. Frankly, on behalf of the victims and the public, this House is perfectly entitled to ask for those things. We should do, and if they were not put in place, we would have to take further action. That is the key to the Leveson approach, and it is one that I want to follow.</p>

	<p pid="b.459.3/1">I wonder whether we could achieve consensus on one of the recommendations in the report, where Leveson recommends the consideration by proprietors of the introduction of a conscience clause to protect journalists who refuse in any way to go against the code of practice.

	<p pid="b.459.4/1">I am very happy to agree to that. There are many sensible recommendations that can be put into place, I would hope, as quickly as possible&#8212;some of the recommendations about the police and the Association of Chief Police Officers, and many of the recommendations about politicians and our relationship with the press. Those do not have to wait for anything, and as I have said, the press do not have to wait for any further discussions; they can start putting this regulation in place straight away.</p>

	<p pid="b.459.5/1">One of Lord Leveson&#8217;s recommendations is that we should legislate to introduce</p>

	<p pid="b.459.5/3">Does my right hon. Friend agree that such a Bill would be utterly alien to our traditions in this country? Will he join me in encouraging Lords Hunt and Black to look at the Leveson recommendations, to see if there are things within them that they could add to their recommendations, and to get on with the job so that we can restore robust confidence in a free press that is the cornerstone of a free society?</p>

	<p pid="b.460.0/1">Frankly, I think we have to be tougher on Hunt and Black than that. We need to say very clearly that what has been proposed so far is progress on the Press Complaints Commission, but that it is not good enough. We need more changes; the public want more changes; the victims want more changes. It is not yet the sort of independent regulation that we can say is right or of which we can be proud. Leveson points out the weaknesses in the system, and we need to plug those gaps. The press need to plug those gaps, and as I say, there is nothing to stop them getting on with that straight away.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.1/1">Does the Prime Minister believe that the press themselves should be able to appoint or veto the appointment of the chairman of the press regulator? Many of his colleagues and a handful of colleagues in my party signed up to that model, with closed minds, even before Leveson reported.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.2/1">One of the points that Leveson makes about the Hunt-Black model is that it needs to be more independent. The Press Complaints Commission was ineffective not only in not being able to investigate or in not having clear enough powers; it was not independent enough. This form of regulation needs to be independent regulation, as set out by Leveson.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.4/1">Yes, of course. What is absolutely vital is that we put in place a regulatory system that they can see has got real teeth. They want to know that it is independent; they want to know that it can achieve big fines; they want to know that it can call editors to account. We could, of course, completely obsess about the issue of statutory underpinning. That is one issue; there are many other issues about what makes for good, strong, robust and independent regulation. That is what we should focus on.</p>

	<p pid="b.460.5/1">The Prime Minister has asked the House to reject Leveson&#8217;s central and essential recommendation of legislation on the grounds, he says, that it would be too difficult to do well.

	<p pid="b.460.6/1">I have great respect for the right hon. Gentleman, but I do not think that that is right at all. The central recommendation of Lord Leveson is to</p>

Frankly, I do not think I would be doing my duty if I came to the House and said that every single aspect is absolutely fine without any changes. I am proud of the fact that we have managed to last for hundreds of years in this country without statutory regulation or mention of the press. If we can continue with that, we should.

	<p pid="b.461.1/1">Let me begin by responding to what my hon. Friend said first. In paragraph 19 of the summary, Lord Leveson makes a special point about Britain&#8217;s regional newspapers. He says that</p>
	<p pid="b.461.1/2">&#8220;their contribution to local life is truly without parallel.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.461.1/3">He praises their role, and says how little they have been involved in the sort of damaging culture and practices to which the rest of the report refers.</p>
	<p pid="b.461.1/4">As for my hon. Friend&#8217;s second point, we must look very carefully at the recommendations for increased transparency. I think, frankly, that transparency is important. The public want to know what is the relationship between politicians on the one hand and the press on the other. If they can see how often you are meeting and whom you meet, they can see whether you have a balanced, proper, sensible relationship with the press or not. We have put transparency in place. I hear murmurings from Labour Members, but in 13 years they did not do a single thing about it.</p>

	<p pid="b.462.3/1">That is a very important question. In his report, Lord Justice Leveson gives a number of alternatives. He clearly prefers his model, but I think that the independence of those either judging an independent regulatory system or appointing people to it is absolutely vital. That is why I am concerned about the role that he puts forward for Ofcom. As I said earlier, the chair of Ofcom is appointed by the Secretary of State, and in my view that makes the two of them too close. In everything that we do, whether via legislation or by means of other backstops, we need to ensure that the people involved in this and the people judging this are properly independent.</p>

Some of the things that were revealed during the inquiry about practices and culture in parts of the press were deeply disturbing. I think that quite a lot has already been done to address those, and to clean up the press&#8217;s act, but clearly more needs to be done.

If we were to try to treat journalists exactly the same as everybody else for the purposes of data protection, I think newspapers, programmes such as &#8220;Panorama&#8221; and others would make very strong representations about what that could mean for investigative journalism.

There should be a proper, independent regulatory system where complaints can be investigated. With the Press Complaints Commission, people had a sense that even if they got their complaint investigated, nothing would actually happen.

The report recommends that that should also apply between senior officers and members of the press and that, to try to end excessively close relationships, there should be a cooling-off period before police officers go and work for newspapers.

We would have to start defining what the body is, what the body does, what powers it has and what the extent of it is, rather as there is in the Irish system. Once we have done that, we would be in danger of finding that we have put in place a statutory Act on the press that is then very, very easy to amend. My point is that this House of Commons should pause, stop and think before taking a step of that magnitude.</p>

That is the absolute key. Of course there is a debate to be had about statutory underpinning, yes or no. But the real debate is: is this regulatory body going to be powerful enough to get to the truth and do what needs to be done?</p>

	<p pid="b.467.4/1">The Defamation Bill is currently going through Parliament with the support of all parties and even of the press. Does the Prime Minister agree that this is a good example of successful statute being introduced by this House&#8212;perhaps the idea is not quite as revolutionary as he said? Does he think it is wrong for newspapers to support statutes which are in their interests but oppose statutes which might protect civil society? Just as he has an open mind to a regulatory model without statute, does he agree that editors should keep an open mind to using some statute?</p>

As I say, there is no need to wait for long conversations about that. He sets out what is wrong with Hunt-Black and what needs to be put in place. That work should start straight away.</p>

	<p pid="b.468.2/1">My hon. Friend makes an important point, which is referred to in paragraph 75 of the summary document, but he needs then to go away and look at the bit of the very long report to which it refers. In paragraph 75, Lord Justice Leveson states:</p>

	<p pid="b.469.2/1">First, may I commend my hon. Friend for his extraordinary powers of speed-reading in getting to page 1781 quite so quickly? He might also want to look at page 1780, which sets out the first part of the statutory underpinning recommended by Lord Justice Leveson, which is a guarantee of media freedom. It is an attractive idea to write a guarantee of media freedom into the law, but even that needs to be qualified. It is worth while looking at subsection 3 of the suggested example, which states:</p>
	<p pid="b.469.2/2">&#8220;Interference with the activities of the media shall be lawful only insofar as it is for a legitimate purpose&#8221;.</p>

	Leveson Inquiry
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2012-11-29b.470.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40528" speakername="Nicholas Clegg" speakeroffice="The Deputy Prime Minister"  colnum="470"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmhansrd/cm121129/debtext/121129-0003.htm#12112958002991">
	<p pid="b.470.1/1">I am grateful for the opportunity to make a further statement to the House. I know it is unusual, but this is an unusual debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/2">The terms of reference for Lord Justice Leveson&#8217;s inquiry were agreed on a cross-party basis and, as the House has heard, we intend to proceed on a cross-party basis, so it is right that Parliament is clear on the initial views of the whole coalition. I agree with much of what has already been said by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition concerning the principles of the Leveson report. That bodes well for the cross-party talks that are taking place for the first time later this afternoon, which in my view must establish an early and clear timetable for the decisions that we must take so that the momentum for action is not lost.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/3">I thank Lord Justice Leveson for his extremely thorough report. There are two big liberal principles at play in this debate: on the one hand, the belief that a raucous and vigorous press is the lifeblood of a healthy democracy, and on the other, the belief that the vulnerable, the innocent and the weak should be protected from powerful vested interests. A free press does not mean a press that is free to bully innocent people or free to abuse grieving families.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/4">What I want now is for us to strike a better balance between these two liberal principles so that our media can scrutinise the powers that be, but cannot destroy innocent lives; so that the journalists up in the Press Gallery can hold us, the politicians, to account, but we can look up to the individuals and families in the Public Gallery knowing that they have the right protections in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/5">I have always said that I would support Lord Justice Leveson&#8217;s reforms, providing they are proportionate and workable. I will come on to why I believe that is the case as far as the report&#8217;s core proposal is concerned&#8212;namely, a tougher system of self-regulation, supported by new independent checks recognised in law. But I do not want to disguise the fact that I have some specific concerns about some specific recommendations&#8212;for example, on some of his ideas concerning data protection rules, and on the suggestion that it should be Ofcom which independently verifies the new press watchdog.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/6">Ofcom has a key role in regulating the content of broadcast media. I am yet to be convinced that it is best placed to take on this new, light-touch function with the print media too. Lord Justice Leveson said in his report that this function could be fulfilled by a different body. However, on the basic model of a new self-regulatory body, established with a change to the law, in principle I believe this can be done in a proportionate and workable way. I understand the entirely legitimate reasons why some Members of the House are wary of using legislation. I myself have thought long and hard about this.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/7">I am a liberal. I do not make laws for the sake of it, and certainly not when it comes to the press. Indeed, when I gave my own evidence to the inquiry, I made the point that if we could create a rigorous, independent system of regulation which covers all the major players without any changes to the law, of course we should consider that. But no one has yet come up with a way of doing that.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/8">Lord Justice Leveson has considered these issues at length. He has found that changing the law is the only way to guarantee a system of self-regulation that seeks to cover all of the press. He explains why his proposed system of sticks and carrots has to be recognised in statute in order to be properly implemented by the courts. What is more, changing the law is the only way to give us all the assurance that the new regulator is not just independent for a few months or years, but is independent for good. Someone will need to check periodically that the independence of the regulator has not been weakened over time, and the report explains why that needs to be set out in law. As Lord Justice Leveson himself states,</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/9">&#8220;this is not, and cannot be characterised as, statutory regulation of the press&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/10">It is a voluntary system, based on incentives, with a guarantee of proper standards. It is not illiberal state regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/11">It is worth dwelling on that point for a moment, because although there has rightly been a lot of discussion about the risks of legislating, some key arguments have been missing from the debate so far. First, the press does not operate in some kind of lawless vacuum; it has to abide by the law. In many instances it is already protected by the law, and I agree with the report that we should go further in enshrining the freedom of the press in statute.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/12">Secondly, it has been suggested that using law will blur the line between politicians and the media, but we must not ignore the extent to which that line has already been blurred under the current system of self-regulation. It is the status quo which has allowed such cosy relationships between political and media elites to arise in the first place. Let us not forget that that of the five Press Complaints Commission chairs, three were serving parliamentarians who took a party whip. Far from allowing greater overlap, the laws that have been proposed give us a chance to create a hard wall between politics and the press.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/13">Thirdly, as the report notes, there is already an example of statutory underpinning in the Irish Press Council, which has been accepted by a number of UK newspapers. The <i>Daily Mail</i>, the <i>Daily Mirror</i>, the <i>Daily Star</i>, <i>The</i> <i>Sun</i>, <i>The Sunday Times</i>, <i>The Mail on Sunday</i> and the <i>Sunday Mirror</i> are all members&#8212;they all publish Irish editions. I have not yet heard those papers complain of a deeply illiberal press environment across the Irish sea.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/14">Of course, neither I nor anyone can be certain of exactly how the proposals will look until we have worked them up in detail. The two tests I have set&#8212;that any reforms must be workable and proportionate&#8212;will need to be met in practice as much as in principle. If they are not, I will be the first to sound the alarm. In that event, we would then need to consider how to make progress, because the absolute worst outcome in all this would be for nothing to happen at all.</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/15">We must not now prevaricate. I, like many people, am impatient for reform. Put bluntly, nothing I have seen so far in this debate suggests to me that we will find a better solution than the one that has been proposed; nor do I draw any hope from the repeated failure of pure self-regulation that we have seen over the past 60 years. We need to get on with this without delay. We owe it to the victims of these scandals, who have already</p>
	<p pid="b.470.1/16">waited too long for us to do the right thing&#8212;too long for an independent press watchdog in which they can put their trust. I am determined that we should not make them wait any more. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.0/1">I thank the Deputy Prime Minister for his excellent statement. This is an unprecedented procedure, but it was important for him to make it as leader of his party. As he has said, our democracy needs, indeed depends upon, the existence of a free press, but a strong press must be a clean press. The wrongdoing brought shame on a press that has a great tradition and is admired around the world. That wrongdoing by the press brought misery to families who were already suffering. We heard the brave and harrowing evidence of the Dowlers and the McCanns. We often talk of walking a mile in someone&#8217;s shoes; none of us would want to walk even one step in theirs.</p>
	<p pid="b.472.0/2">The Leveson proposals are to stop that happening again. Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree that they will strengthen the press by ensuring that it has the legitimacy&#8212;the moral authority&#8212;to hold power to account, and that by providing for a proper complaints system, they will protect individuals from abuse and unwarranted intrusion? We believe that the system Leveson proposes is independent both of politicians and of the press. We also believe that that can be achieved only by legislation on the basis Leveson proposes. Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree?</p>
	<p pid="b.472.0/3">Will the Deputy Prime Minister commit to the timetable that the Leader of the Opposition has set out: that by the end of January next year, this House should have the opportunity to debate and vote on taking the Leveson proposals forward? Will he commit his party to vote to support Leveson&#8217;s core proposals? Does he agree that we should expect the legislation to have completed its passage through both Houses by the end of the next parliamentary Session, which starts in May next year? We are about to go into all-party talks. Will he assure the House that he will not kick this into the long grass? Will he assure us that he will not allow the press to have yet another lock-in at the last-chance saloon?</p>
	<p pid="b.472.0/4">I agree with what the Deputy Prime Minister said, but does he agree that what the Prime Minister said amounts to nothing more than a craven acceptance of the status quo? If the Prime Minister does not think again, he will have surrendered to powerful press interests and betrayed the victims.</p>

	<p pid="b.472.1/1">It is obvious, of course, that the Prime Minister and I come at this from different angles, but the right hon. and learned Lady should not overlook the perfectly legitimate misgivings&#8212;I happen not to share them, but they are none the less misgivings&#8212;that the Prime Minister has expressed about legislation in such a sensitive area.</p>
	<p pid="b.472.1/2">I have no problem with a speedy timetable, which is obviously one of the main things that we need to concentrate on this afternoon in the cross-party talks. I strongly agree with the right hon. and learned Lady that the long grass is last place this problem should end up. We have got to act now in one way or another.</p>
	<p pid="b.472.1/3">Lord Justice Leveson has put forward his proposals, and I am convinced that he has made a case for legislation. I have not seen&#8212;no one has&#8212;what that legislation would actually look like. It is important that we see his proposals translated into draft legislative form so that we can all examine that and make the rapid progress that I think everybody, whatever their different views on specific aspects of this report, believes is now necessary.</p>

The press have already sought a statutory underpinning of what they do. All that Leveson is proposing is to give greater strength to the process that they began in 1998.</p>

	<p pid="b.473.3/1">What I think we can all agree on&#8212;Lord Justice Leveson places great emphasis on this in his report&#8212;is that none of this would have arisen if the press had abided by its own code. What surprised all witnesses to the Leveson inquiry&#8212;it certainly surprised me, because I was not familiar with the details of the code&#8212;was that on reading the code, one thought, &#8220;This is excellent&#8212;brilliant!&#8221; We just need to ensure that it is enforced.</p>
	<p pid="b.473.3/2">That is where the debate now comes: it is about the means. Everybody agrees that the end must be the application of the principles set out by Lord Justice Leveson. Everybody agrees that the code itself was well drafted and that, if it had been enforced in full, the problems would not have arisen in the first place. The debate, which is clearly already raging this afternoon, is about how we can make absolutely sure that that is done in a way that is independently monitored and that endures. My view is that Lord Justice Leveson has made the case for why that can be done only through legislation, although I stress that how that legislation is crafted is a separate matter, to which the House will need to address itself.</p>

The latter is not a philosophy that I believe in&#8212;it is a one-eyed approach to freedom. The press has always operated within the ambit and the context of the law. It is creating a straw man to imply that law is always inimical to the exercise of freedom in the press.

Thirdly, and crucially, he thinks that there should be additional protections in law to enshrine the freedom of the press. I ask the hon.

That is why the detail and the design of the incentives he is offering to the press are incredibly important.</p>

Kate and Gerry McCann had their privacy abused and were subject to the most shocking and vile accusations, which they could not have possibly remedied through the law. The hon. Gentleman should read Gerry McCann&#8217;s evidence if he really thinks it is undemocratic or illiberal to suggest that maybe we should set up a system that can help people like them. Gerry McCann went to the Press Complaints Commission and was basically told, &#8220;Sorry, there is nothing we can do.&#8221; Surely, one would have to have a heart of stone not to accept that there is something seriously, seriously wrong when there is nothing that helps Kate and Gerry McCann.

In many ways, the Irish model is a much more direct form of the statutory establishment of a regulator than the indirect verification of a self-established regulator set up by the press. There is an important qualitative difference between the two, although, as I said earlier, it is remarkable that a number of British newspapers operate, as far as I can make out, relatively comfortably under the more exacting&#8212;dare it say slightly more illiberal?&#8212;system that exists across the Irish sea.</p>

	<p pid="b.483.2/1">Central Bedfordshire college is a vital institution in the constituency I am proud to represent. It has a presence in all three of the towns in my constituency&#8212;Dunstable, Leighton Buzzard and Houghton Regis. I am a strong supporter of the vital work of colleges, as they provide the skills that people need to make Britain a high value-added economy. It has an excellent new principal in Ali Hadawi, who was recently appointed a Commander of the British Empire and who turned his last college into a beacon college. I have every confidence he will do the same for Central Bedfordshire college.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.2/2">The college was founded in 1961 as Dunstable college, originally with a focus on the printing trade, and most of the buildings are the original 50-year-old buildings. C and F blocks, for example, were built in 1959 and 1960. The remaining buildings were built in 1968, with the newest built in 1973, so my hon. Friend the Minister can see that they are now quite dated.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.2/3">Central Bedfordshire college was one of 70 colleges that lost out under the old Learning and Skills Council&#8217;s Building Colleges for the Future capital programme. The college initially put in a &#163;5 million proposal, but was told that that was not big enough and that it should go back and produce something grander&#8212;with an atrium, I believe. The college was encouraged to work up a more expensive proposal. It then put in a &#163;40 million proposal, but unfortunately no one at the Learning and Skills Council was totting up the total cost of all the bids and the capital programme collapsed. Central Bedfordshire college was one of 70 colleges not to receive any capital grant. Those 70 colleges then went through a bidding process for the remaining amount of money available, and 13 were successful. I believe that, for some reason, all of them were in Labour constituencies, including a late application from Hartlepool college. This took place under the previous Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.483.4/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/2">As I was saying, there were then 57 colleges left, of which 45 were given financial assistance to prop up their balance sheets. That left 12 colleges out of the original 70 without any assistance for capital funding under the old Learning and Skills Council regime. I believe that Central Bedfordshire college is one of the very few colleges not to have received any capital funding under the three enhanced renewal grant capital funding rounds that the new Government have introduced.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/3">I would like to know how many colleges benefiting from the Learning and Skills Council capital grant, which was allocated under the previous Government, have received further capital funding under the enhanced renewal grant funding process. I would also be interested to know how many colleges had their ERG applications approved when they were not able to meet the match funding requirement. Central Bedfordshire college was able to meet that requirement in each of the three ERG application rounds that it put in for.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/4">To recap, Central Bedfordshire college has put in three ERG bids. The first was in July 2010, when it requested a &#163;1 million contribution from the Skills Funding Agency to match a &#163;3 million contribution from the college itself. That bid was unsuccessful. The second bid, in November 2011, involved the college requesting a &#163;2 million contribution from the SFA to match a &#163;4 million contribution from the college. Most recently, in September 2012, the college requested &#163;3 million from the SFA to match a &#163;6 million contribution from the college.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/5">The college had been led to believe that its bid would be prioritised, as it had not received even a pound in capital funding from those earlier rounds. It has had no written feedback on the bid process, although it has been told that it can attend a surgery at the SFA regional office. There is some puzzlement among the people running the college as to how all this is worked out. If the process is not helping the neediest colleges, perhaps it needs to be looked at again.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/6">I want to go into more detail about the feedback that has been received from the SFA on why the third bid was unsuccessful. Will the Minister tell me whether the due diligence exercise that is going to take place in relation to the colleges whose bids were successful could be applied to Central Bedfordshire college, to see whether it could be awarded a few more points? I understand that the bid failed by just one point, and if we could look again to see whether any additional points could be awarded, there might be a happier outcome. I understand that the college&#8217;s education case scored the highest number of points in the whole of the eastern region, and the third highest in the whole country. I am sure the Minister would agree that the education bid is at the heart of what further education colleges should be about. I wonder whether that part of the bid should have slightly more weighting than some of the more technical considerations relating to the building proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/7">As I have said, this is the third enhanced renewal grant that the college has not been successful in securing. It has been acknowledged by officials in the Skills Funding Agency that the college is one of the neediest, if not the neediest, college in the country. In May this year, I was present when the outgoing SFA chief executive, Geoff Russell, visited Central Bedfordshire college, and he commented that the college did not need just an ERG; he would have liked to have seen a complete rebuild. Speaking as the local MP, I believe that the learners in Central Bedfordshire college deserve just as much support for creating a conducive learning environment as other students in other colleges throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/8">If the process is not helping the neediest colleges, we should have a look at how that process runs. I shall discuss four specific technical areas where we think the bid has lost out. The SFA commented that the refurbishment element had not been properly environmentally assessed.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/9">The primary objective of the college&#8217;s bid was to construct a new centre for hair, beauty, holistic therapies and hospitality and catering, with a focus on green technology in the curriculum and skills development. In order to achieve the new build in the optimum campus location, the college had to relocate other curriculum elements, with a small amount of associated refurbishment. The college understands that it was marked down because that latter refurbishment element did not have a full environmental assessment&#8212;unlike the main new build. That refurbishment element represented only 3.3% of the total project budget. It is simply an enabling element for the project itself, and the overall project has been environmentally assessed. The college feels unhappy about that aspect of its bid&#8217;s assessment.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/10">The second aspect of the bid was the savings in estate costs over a 20-year period. The college was advised that other bids demonstrated larger savings over the project life of 20 years. The college, however, has come in the top quarter for national estates cost efficiency, as demonstrated by the SFA&#8217;s own data collection, which I understand is known as &#8220;e-Mandate&#8221;. That makes it hard for the college to demonstrate a huge decrease in building costs related to the bid, because it starts from such an efficient base. As a result, its savings are likely to be at a lower margin. That efficiency has been achieved by the college being very prudent and managing its projects from within its own estates department, for example. Again, the college feels that this rather crude assessment fails to take into account the efficiency point that it has already reached, even for a 50-year-old building, so it believes that it has been unfairly penalised for doing the right thing, as it were.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/11">The third technical aspect on which the bid was marked down related to the costs of the proposed project build against the SFA&#8217;s own cost plan. The feedback stated that the bid was 10% adrift from the SFA&#8217;s cost plan norms. In simple terms, the bid comprised the following three parts. First, there is the demolition of the old F block, dating back to 1959, as I told the Minister at the start of my speech. That F block was going to be replaced with a new build centre of excellence for green catering and for hair, beauty and holistic therapies. That did fall within the SFA&#8217;s cost norms. Secondly, there is the partial demolition of the B block and the construction of a new media studies centre, together with associated works, which also fell within the SFA cost norms.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/12">It was the third aspect that I think caused the college problems: the creation of a new surface-level car park and access road from the public highway. The project costs are required to conform to the appropriate SFA cost model for the type of college establishment. The first two elements of the bid, the demolition of the F block and the partial demolition of the B block, accorded with the SFA&#8217;s criteria. It was the third element, the car park, that did not accord with its indicative costs and is being regarded as abnormal.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/13">The college has commented that it is required to dispose of a portion of its estate in order to release capital to contribute to the cost of the project. It has also said that the land to be disposed of currently houses a significant proportion of its car-parking provision, and that because it is not practicable for it to operate</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/14">effectively without replacing that lost parking provision, it must be replaced elsewhere on the campus. The replacement of the car park and the provision of a new access road are a fundamental component of any redevelopment scheme that relies on capital release from the sale of land to the rear of the college to enable the college to make its substantial contribution to the overall project costs.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/15">It was recognised at an early stage in the preparation of the stage C cost plan that the creation of the new car park would show the project costs at an unacceptable level of variance to the cost model, and for that reason two cost model comparisons were prepared and included. The first compared project costs associated with the B and F block works and their associated external works, and the second compared all project costs, including the creation of a new car park and access road.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/16">The fourth element was health and safety, on which the bid was marked down. The college has said to me that the reason a significant improvement was not shown was that it had already taken care of that aspect of the bid. It had worked very hard, with its own money, to deal with all the health and safety issues that might have arisen, and not a great deal of further progress could have been made.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/17">I hope that I have helped the Minister by giving him some feedback from the college. I hope that I have managed to explain why it feels aggrieved. In particular, I hope that I have managed to explain why the car park is necessary to the release of that significant extra contribution. The Minister has heard something of a litany of complaints, but I want to end on a positive note by telling him about the excellent things that the college is doing, notwithstanding the difficulties which I have outlined and which I hope he will be able to address when he responds.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/18">Central Bedfordshire college is the proud sponsor of the new Central Bedfordshire university technical college, which is one of only two UTCs in the country that opened in September this year. It will have 600 students, and I am immensely proud that the only UTC in the east of England is in my constituency. It is a fantastic innovation, and it is exactly what the country needs to drive it towards a prosperous future.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/19">Under construction in another location is the Incuba centre, a &#163;5 million facility to help new businesses to develop Dunstable with a focus on the green economy. That is very welcome. It will help to re-energise the industrial base in Dunstable and Houghton Regis, and also the wider economy. Central Bedfordshire college is at the heart of that.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/20">More recently, the college bought a former Volkswagen garage in the Luton road in Dunstable which it is turning into the most fantastic motor vehicle training facility. A real, live, state-of-the-art garage facility, in a building where a commercial garage was operating only a few months ago, will enable my constituents and people from the wider area to train to become motor mechanics in excellent conditions.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/21">I know that the Minister is particularly interested in the college&#8217;s work with local employers. Again, it is doing all the things that he is asking colleges to do. It has, for instance, worked very closely with the Morrisons supermarket. I was proud to attend an event hosted jointly by the college and Morrisons. The college had provided up to 100 local unemployed people with a</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/22">specific training course over the summer. If they completed it, they would be guaranteed a job interview at the new Morrisons branch that was opening in Houghton Regis. That initiative has been hugely successful. It has been excellent for the local unemployed people and excellent for the supermarket, which has really appreciated it. The college has done a fantastic thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/23">The college is also working with other employers, including BAE Systems and Liebherr, engaging with them to develop an employer-tailored curriculum. It is working with Center Parcs, too, another new major provider of employment in central Bedfordshire, and with the developer of the new housing development north of Houghton Regis, which will require lots of construction skills.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/24">It is a bugbear of mine that when there are major construction projects, the jobs often do not go to local people. It upsets me when people come in from miles around to take the jobs. Unemployed construction workers come to see me at my surgery. I am determined, as is Central Bedfordshire college, that many of the jobs created in the building of thousands of new houses to the north of Houghton Regis to help pay for the Dunstable northern bypass will be taken by local people. That is very important. CBC is at the forefront of providing the skills for the construction companies contracted to carry out that work.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/25">The college also works with London Luton airport in delivering cabin crew and baggage-handling skills. It is working with Luton Town football club and the Bedfordshire football association to deliver coaching and football qualifications. It is also working with our local train company, First Capital Connect.</p>
	<p pid="b.483.4/26">I hope the Minister will therefore see that the college has heard the Government&#8217;s message and is mustard-keen to provide the skills our local economy needs to help UK plc compete in the global race in which we are engaged. We just need a little bit of help with the capital funding. I think we have had a bit of a rough deal for a while now, but I know the Minister is a fair man, and I know he will look seriously into these issues. I look forward to hearing what he has to say.</p>

	<p pid="b.487.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40557" name="Andrew Selous">the Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)</phrase> on securing this debate, which is so important for Central Bedfordshire college&#8212;for everybody who works at it and, most importantly, everybody who studies at it. I know that he raised this issue with my predecessor, and he has also raised it with me a number of times. He is a powerful advocate for the need for improvements.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/2">I also congratulate the college on its success in opening the new university technical college. UTCs are a crucial part of ensuring we have the skills we need in the years and decades ahead. I also commend the college on the work it is doing with local businesses to provide the skills employers need, and to ensure we make good any skills shortages. Colleges across the country are increasingly working with local employers and businesses to ensure we provide the skills they need. The driving mission behind the work we are doing and behind my job is to ensure that local people have the skills they need for the jobs that are available, such as in the construction industry, as my hon. Friend mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/3">For decades, colleges were starved of the funding for capital renewal that both schools and universities enjoyed. I know that from personal experience because I studied at a further education college&#8212;West Cheshire college&#8212;in the mid-1990s. Therefore, when the Learning and Skills Council offered significant capital grants, the colleges jumped at the opportunity. My hon. Friend set out the history of what happened. Bids were encouraged, and were encouraged to grow, and then promises were made without the funding to match them. Hugely expensive projects with poor cost control delivered very poor value for money in some of the projects that were completed. They ran out of money, and building projects were stopped, sometimes after huge expense on plans and with diggers in the ground. In that context, and in the context of the wider catastrophe that was the public finances, we are now trying to rebuild. I say that to give the background before getting on to the specifics of the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/4">We have been working hard to ensure that lessons are learned from that period. One of those lessons, inevitably, is that we should have a firm and unbending eye on value for money, the physical infrastructure needs of colleges and the benefits to students that capital spending can bring. The approach is coupled with the urgency for affordability. That is the background to how the criteria for making decisions are structured.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/5">We consult the sector on the criteria for deciding allocations. We then provide colleges with advice on the criteria, assess and moderate&#8212;and fund when an application is successful. We are happy to work with the college to develop a fundable case. I will certainly look at my hon. Friend&#8217;s point about due diligence and moderation executed on successful projects to see whether those can be applied in this case.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/6">Since May 2010, total Government investment across the country in new colleges amounts to more than &#163;330 million. That has enabled more than &#163;1 billion-worth of projects. Across the whole programme, &#163;2 of private cash have been put in for every &#163;1 of Government cash. My hon. Friend said that that was the case with Central Bedfordshire college&#8217;s bids, too.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/7">Let me go through some of the specifics of what has happened in the three rounds of renewal grant that have been set out so far. The first is that we have had 117 bids for college funding, which would have cost in excess of &#163;200 million if all had been approved. I entirely understand my hon. Friend&#8217;s argument about the quality of the buildings at the college&#8212;60% of its buildings are in poor or inoperable condition. I am sad to report to him that, of the 240 general further education colleges across the country, 59 are in a worse state on this measure than Central Bedfordshire college. Although the college has a high level of need, such need, unfortunately, is replicated in some colleges across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/8">The first criterion relates to the condition of the existing estate; Central Bedfordshire college has a case, but there are other colleges with a worse rating. The second criterion is value for money, and my hon. Friend reported the concerns raised about that issue. I entirely understand his point that, having done work to ensure good value for money in respect of running costs, the college feels penalised. He will understand that value for money has to be a critical part of our assessment. I give my hon. Friend this commitment: we will work with the college to see what can be done to improve the</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/9">value for money in the bid. The third criterion is the benefits that would flow from the work as planned. In that area, as he stated, Central Bedfordshire college did relatively well.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/10">On my hon. Friend&#8217;s specific questions, 10 colleges got funds without match funding, but they offered much stronger value for money and benefits in the rest of their bids. Of course, the amount of match funding is a critical part of the question, but it is not the only element of value for money. Only one college in the third round of the enhanced renewal grant had received serious amounts of money since 2001. A very strong emphasis was placed in these bids on those colleges that have received less than &#163;5 million since 2001, and in the third round only one college, Barnsley college, had received more than that since then. By contrast, Central Bedfordshire college had received &#163;450,000 since 2010, including &#163;225,000 in the first round, &#163;100,000 in the second round and &#163;120,000 to help work up the bid for the third round. We are going to have to work with the college in future to see what further we can do to try to get it over the line.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/11">My hon. Friend asked about written feedback, which will, of course, be provided. Earlier this month, the college, including the principal, met civil servants for oral feedback, but we will also provide written feedback. On my hon. Friend&#8217;s point about rebuild, I am tempted not to recommend that we again go down the route of suggesting yet more expensive propositions for the college, but we should keep all options on the table. On the point about the education case being the best in the east of England, I am glad to say that these things are no longer done on a regional basis and are instead done on a national basis. The college scored well in that area.</p>
	<p pid="b.487.0/12">As my hon. Friend said, the college scored 21 out of a possible 39 points in the process and was just one point short of the score deemed necessary to secure funding. There is broad agreement that the process was carried out on a fair, open and competitive basis; the process was agreed in consultation with the sector. Even so, an appeals process is available for colleges that feel they have been hard done by. I entirely understand his disappointment and I commend the pressure he is applying.</p>
