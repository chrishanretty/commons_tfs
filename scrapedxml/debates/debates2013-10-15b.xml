I also welcome <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40373" name="Stephen Twigg">the hon.

	<p pid="b.577.10/2">It is of course good that people are motivated to campaign for what they believe in, whether inside or outside a traditional political party.

Campaigning by third parties at general elections should therefore be made more transparent and accountable.</p>

	<p pid="b.577.11/1">I am sure that the Deputy Prime Minister has, like many hon.

	<p pid="b.577.11/2">Bill. The right hon. Gentleman has assiduously cultivated those groups in the past, and frankly, they feel betrayed.

Better still, will he recognise, even at this late stage, that he has got this badly wrong and join us in opposing the Bill?</p>

	<p pid="b.578.0/1">My view is that if we did nothing about the increasing trend of big money in British politics, which seeks to influence the outcome of political contests through groups that are not political parties, those very same groups would campaign after the next general election, saying that we should do something about that trend. At the general election, non-party political funds doubled to &#163;3 million. We have seen what happens when that gets out of control. Just look across the Atlantic at the United States: super-PACs&#8212;political action committees; the increasing polarisation of politics; and people outside the democratic political process, non-political parties, trying to influence the outcome of elections. We will maintain the rules, as they have existed since 2000, on whether groups are regulated as third party campaign groups. All we are saying is that non-party political parties that want to act like a political party should be asked to fill in the same paperwork as a political party.</p>

	<p pid="b.578.1/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that there is nothing in the Bill that stops campaigns on particular policies? Furthermore, we will not end up with third party groups spending more than political candidates are able to spend on their own election.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.578.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40528" speakername="Nicholas Clegg" colnum="578"  time="11:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#131015-0001.htm_spmin2">
	<p pid="b.578.2/1">My hon. Friend is exactly right. Under the current rules, a well-funded third party campaign group seeking to influence the democratic outcome in a constituency or constituencies could spend more money than a political party. That, surely, cannot be right. The Labour party, which is run by a third party campaign group, the trade unions, does not think it is a problem if political parties are influenced by third party campaign groups that might have political designs. Nothing in the Bill would stop Make Poverty History spending millions on its campaign. Nothing would stop the Green Alliance grading us all on our green promises&#8212;nothing would change that.</p>

	<p pid="b.578.3/1">Returning to planet earth, the Deputy Prime Minister regularly bleats on about the value of consultation. Why did that not apply to the lobbying Bill? There was no form of consultation whatever on this wretched Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.578.4/1">There was extensive consultation and scrutiny on the lobbying provisions in the Bill. The parts on third party campaigning were discussed extensively by the three parties in the cross-party funding talks. It was agreed by all parties, and backed by Sir Christopher Kelly in his recommendations on party funding reform, that any change to party funding arrangements should also include some limits on third party campaign groups when they want to influence the political outcome in a constituency or constituencies.</p>

	<p pid="b.579.0/1">Does the Deputy Prime Minister agree that there is huge public demand for complete transparency in the influence of trade unions, especially during election periods and especially given the allegations concerning the actions of Unite in the affairs of the Labour party earlier this year?</p>

	<p pid="b.579.1/1">I have this old-fashioned view that in all our constituencies candidates from our democratic political parties should be slugging it out on a level playing field and that we should not have people pulling the strings in the background in an untransparent way. That is all the Bill is trying to do. Anyone who believes in the integrity and transparency of democratic, open contest in our constituencies should support the Bill.</p>

The results were much better than we anticipated and, using a combination of national and local data, could lead to an overall average match rate of 85%. In addition, we are making registration simpler by enabling online registration, and in June we announced &#163;4.2 million-worth of measures to maximise voter registration ahead of the transition to individual electoral registration.</p>

	<p pid="b.579.6/1">I know that the Cabinet Office has been working with the Ministry of Defence to ensure that efforts are undertaken. Considerable efforts have been made in the past, but where we can do more, we should do more, in order to encourage anyone who is eligible to vote to do so and to enter into the new individual voter registration system, as I explained earlier.</p>

	<p pid="b.579.7/1">As well as the problem of not enough voters being registered, there is a problem of voters registered under the wrong category.

	<p pid="b.579.8/1">I am not sure precisely what my hon.

	<p pid="b.580.1/1">Absolutely; in designing the system of individual voter registration that we are introducing, we looked very carefully at the strengths and weaknesses of the experience in Northern Ireland. The most important innovation on which we have embarked is the one I explained earlier, which is matching the very large databases that we already have with information on the electoral register and, in effect, automatically enrolling millions of people on the individual voter registration system.</p>

	<p pid="b.580.5/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, the data-matching tests are a dry run and have exceeded expectations. We think that the use of those central databases, particularly the DWP database, combined with what we do with other databases, should raise the overall figure of automatic enrolment when that finally happens. As he also knows, we have done a considerable amount to ensure that there is a two-year roll-over period, so that people who do not automatically register before the next general election will still have an opportunity to do so, while door-to-door information will be provided to people so that they will know how the new system works. We have put as many belt-and-braces provisions in place as possible, therefore, to ensure that the maximum number of people are on the new IER system.</p>

We tested it to destruction in seven meetings that brought the three parties together over a prolonged period on the back of very strong recommendations from Sir Christopher Kelly and his Committee. Not to put it too delicately, the same old vested interests relating to donation caps on the one hand and the financial relationship between the Labour party and the trade unions on the other were, once again, not reconcilable. Until we get those two things aligned, a cross-party agreement on party funding is unlikely&#8212;but it will have to happen eventually; otherwise we will be afflicted by scandal after scandal and controversy after controversy.</p>

	<p pid="b.582.2/1">If I understand it correctly, moves are afoot, although they are rather opaque to an outsider so far as the trade union funding link with the Labour party is concerned. More generally, transparency has to be a good thing when money is sloshing around the system and it could influence democratic electoral contests. To return to my earlier theme, this is what the transparency provisions on third party campaigning are all about&#8212;not to stop charities from doing their work or from campaigning, but simply to make them transparent in how the money is used, particularly where they choose to use money for explicitly political ends to engineer or influence a particular outcome in a constituency.</p>

	<p pid="b.582.3/1">The problem with the Deputy Prime Minister&#8217;s position is that he was willing to rush out a Bill to capture what amounts to a small problem, which may well damage democracy, but he was not prepared to put the weight of his position behind actually achieving a solution on party funding.</p>

I do not think that we should beat about the bush.</p>
	<p pid="b.582.4/2">As for the hon. Lady&#8217;s first point, I urge her not to be complacent about the trend towards the funnelling of increasingly large amounts of money into the political process by non-political parties.

	<p pid="b.583.0/1">First, I do not think that it is possible to view one of those figures in isolation. It is not possible to consider the &#163;19 million or the &#163;15 million figure without trying to incorporate it in a cross-party consensus on political party funding, which has eluded us so far. As for individual donations to individual candidates, our Bill increases the limit from &#163;500 to &#163;700.</p>
	<p pid="b.583.0/2">Secondly, charities and campaign organisations that are not seeking to influence the outcome of an electoral contest in a constituency can spend as much money as they like. They can spend millions and millions of pounds, unregulated, if they are not seeking to enter into the democratic process. If they do seek to enter into the democratic process, why are they not asked to fill in the same paperwork as political parties?</p>

	<p pid="b.596.7/1">My hon. Friend will be aware that the scheme is currently restricted to a list of serious offences. It is right to say that we have added to that list in recent years. In August 2012, the offence of trafficking people for exploitation was added, as were racially or religiously aggravated assaults in October 2003 and various offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 in 2006. It is always possible for cases to be added to the list, but it is important to bear in mind that references take up court time and there must be a limit to the</p>
	<p pid="b.596.7/2">number of cases that the Court of Appeal can hear. One must also bear in mind that there has to be a degree of finality and these things have to be balanced out. If my hon. Friend knows of any cases or types of offences that he thinks might be added, I am always happy to consider such matters. It is, obviously, ultimately a matter for my right hon. Friend the Lord Chancellor, but we discuss these matters and will act if we think it necessary.</p>

It is important that cases should be reviewed quickly.

	<p pid="b.599.2/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That leave be given to bring in a Bill to provide for the regulation of letting agents; to protect tenants&#8217; deposits; to require the enforcement of environmental and energy-efficiency standards in private-sector rented accommodation; to amend the law on secure tenancies; to provide for fair rent to be applicable to all rented accommodation; to require landlords not to discriminate against people in receipt of state benefits; to require local authorities to establish a private rented sector office; and for connected purposes.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/3">I first introduced this Bill earlier this year on <phrase class="date" code="2013-02-26">26 February</phrase>. Since then, the debate about the regulation of the private rented sector has gathered pace. It is now much more commonplace for all of us to be invited to endless seminars on the private rented sector and stories abound about the way in which people are treated in the sector. This matter ought to be part of the mainstream political debate on housing in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/4">There are essentially three elements to housing in this country: owner-occupation, housing provided by local authorities or housing associations, and the private rented sector. I will take them in turn. Owner-occupation has been the cornerstone of the housing policies of successive Governments for a long time. However, the rate of owner-occupation is steadily and steeply in decline, to the extent that it is well below the high point of 70%. There is every sign that it will continue to drop over the decades, as mortgages become more expensive and more difficult to secure for people on average incomes or below, despite the Government&#8217;s home-ownership objectives.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/5">The second area is council housing and housing association properties. Council housing provides good quality, secure accommodation, but it is in desperately short supply, particularly in London and the south-east. I am the first to admit that the solution to our housing problems lies in the much more rapid development of much more council housing all over the country. That would provide a good quality way out of housing desperation for many people. I hope that that policy is increasingly accepted and developed.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/6">Although I recognise that housing associations were founded to bring in good quality housing on a similar basis to council housing, I am becoming increasingly concerned about their behaviour and conduct. Increasingly, they act like housing companies, not social landlords, and see themselves as being in the property market, rather than in the provision of housing for people who are in desperate need. That area is in need of tight regulation.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/7">The third area is the private rented sector, which has traditionally been very small in this country. It has now started to rise rapidly. Nationally, it makes up 17% of the housing stock. That is predicted to rise to 22% by 2025. It is an extremely different story in some parts of the country. In the borough of Islington, which I am happy to represent with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40335" name="Emily Thornberry">the Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry)</phrase>, who is here to indicate her approval of the Bill, the make-up</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/8">is very different. Owner-occupation now makes up less than 30% of housing stock across the borough and is declining fast. Social housing&#8212;housing association and council housing&#8212;is about 40% of the stock and rising, as the local authority, to its great credit, manages to undertake some building programmes to ensure that people have a decent roof over their head. However, the private rented sector makes up well over 30% of the housing in the borough.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/9">Some who rent in the private sector in London are very wealthy, can afford to pay any price that is offered and do not particularly care about it. There are also those on middle incomes&#8212;young, professional people who move into London and pay an extraordinarily high proportion of what ought to be a decent wage on private rents. Then there are people on very low incomes who cannot get anywhere near the housing ladder but cannot get anywhere near getting a council property either. They are stuck in expensive private rented accommodation, often paying half their take-home pay just to keep an inadequate, expensive roof over their head.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/10">There are also people who are placed in private rented accommodation by the local authority, and they are the ones who suffer the most. They are often in inadequate, badly maintained accommodation with landlords who know that the tenants are in no position to complain about anything.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/11">The one thing that unites all those groups is insecurity about their housing. I guess that most Members are owner-occupiers and do not feel any great insecurity about their housing situation. It is not so for a large number of people in this country. We therefore need effective regulation of all private rented accommodation, so that there are decent environmental standards and not excessive energy bills. We need strict regulation of what letting agents do, because currently anyone can set up as a letting agent straight away. At the very least, we need Criminal Records Bureau checks, and we need anti-discrimination legislation to be enforced on letting agencies&#8212;not just when there is discrimination against people on housing benefit, but when there is discrimination against people of minority ethnic communities, which is absolutely disgraceful and is illegal under general anti-discrimination law.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/12">We also need the guaranteed return of deposits and much longer tenancies. Traditionally, assured shorthold tenancies last for six months in this country. Sometimes they are repeated and sometimes they are not, but they are almost never repeated if the tenant complains about conditions or requires the landlord to make some repairs during the first six months. The tenant finds that their tenancy is simply terminated. We therefore also need tenancies of at least five years, to reduce the level of insecurity.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/13">When the Government tell me that the cost of private rented accommodation is one of the main drivers of this country&#8217;s large housing allowance bill, I absolutely agree with them. However, the way to deal with it is not by restricting the level of housing benefit paid to tenants but by controlling the level of rent that is paid. Other countries seem to manage that well, and I feel deeply angry when I meet people in my advice bureau every week who tell me that they are, in effect, being socially cleansed out of an area they have lived in for a long time</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/14">because the housing benefit is inadequate for the level of rent that is charged. They are being forced to scatter all over London and all over the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/15">Some colleagues tell me that regulation of the private rented sector and rent levels is not a problem in their constituency, and I understand that. There is a vast discrepancy in rent levels across the country, from &#163;300 to &#163;400 a week in London to &#163;100 a week, or in some cases even slightly less, in other parts of the country. However, if the House does not pass strict regulation of the private rented sector now, starting in London and the south-east, the problem will spread across the country as the sector gets bigger and bigger.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/16">My Bill would bring about better security, such as there is in Germany, where tenancies last almost a lifetime. It would bring about better conditions for tenants and much more stable communities. In some wards in my constituency, population turnover is 30% a year, almost all occasioned by the insecurity of the private rented sector. What does that do to the stability of a community? Where does it get its community activists, school governors and movers and shakers from if there is no security and no investment in that community?</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/17">Finally, the Bill would bring about rent regulation. Some people are not keen on that&#8212;some landlords do not like it, but some recognise that the stability provided by a fair rent formula of the sort we used to have in this country would be a useful step forward. My Bill seeks to establish local authority run, fair-rent regulation authorities, the first of which would cover the whole of Greater London. We would start with the principle that rent should bear some resemblance to the cost of a property&#8212;often it bears none whatsoever&#8212;and ensure that we gain the security of tenure required to bring about a much better and fairer society.</p>
	<p pid="b.599.2/18">I hope the House will support this Bill today to end the insecurity and injustice, and recognise that some local authorities such as Newham and Oxford have made enormous steps forward to try and bring about some degree of regulation and stability in the private rented sector. The Bill is not a threat to good landlords who seek to do the right thing and look after their tenants; it is a threat to the cowboys, bad landlords, discriminators and those who refuse to repair their properties or return deposits at the end of a tenure. I hope the House will support the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.603.0/1">I will be brief because, as Members will recall, clause 104 introduces a new offence of forced marriage. The new offence is an important part of our efforts to stamp out that appalling practice, and will send a clear message that it will not be tolerated. I am pleased the Scottish Government has also decided that forced marriage should be a criminal offence, and new clause 9 introduces a similar provision for Scotland. Breach of a forced marriage protection order is already a criminal offence in Scotland, so there is no need for a similar amendment to mirror clause 103, which makes that the case in England and Wales. The other amendments in the group are consequential on new clause 9.</p>

	<p pid="b.603.1/1">I was not in the Chamber yesterday, so may I welcome the Minister to his new post and let him know that any conspiracy theories he comes up with about me will probably be true?</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/2">The Opposition accept the need to deal decisively with forced marriage in Scotland, as in England, and we are pleased that the Government are extending to Scotland provisions that make forcing someone into a marriage a criminal offence. We therefore support the new clause and its consequential amendments. It was clear from evidence taken in Committee that there are differing views on the issue, and some who are active in the sector oppose the use of criminal law in that area because they believe it would deter victims from reporting what is happening to them. That is an understandable view, but not one I share. Victims of forced marriage are British. They are of many ages, although many are young people. British boys and girls, of whatever colour, deserve the same protection as every other British boy and girl.</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/3">It is important to make the point that forced marriages are not about religious beliefs&#8212;they are not condoned by any of the major faiths, whether Christianity, Islam or Hinduism. Forced marriages are about abuse, often of children. What we condemn as abuse in any other sector of society cannot be condoned because of the colour of a person&#8217;s skin, their ethnic background or their parents&#8217; culture. I am therefore glad that new clause 9 will make coercing someone into a marriage a criminal offence in all parts of the UK. I hope we will give young people, their communities and others the confidence to challenge forced marriage and to stand up and say no, knowing that they are supported by the law throughout the country, and, I would hope, by others in the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/4">It is fair to say that, in some respects, Scotland has moved ahead of the rest of the UK on the matter because, as the Minister has said, breach of a forced marriage protection order is a criminal offence in Scotland, as it will be in the rest of the UK when the Bill becomes law. It is therefore clearly right that new clause 9 extends the criminal offence of coercing someone into a marriage into Scottish law. However, the UK Government and the Scottish Government need to do much more. No forced marriage protection orders have been issued in Scotland since its current legislation came into force, and yet no one would seriously argue that there were no forced marriages last year. In fact, the UK forced marriage unit gave support in 1,483 cases related to possible forced marriage. That is a high number, but the National</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/5">Centre for Social research report published in 2009 estimated that there were between 5,000 and 8,000 reported cases throughout the UK each year. Of course, many cases go unreported.</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/6">The Opposition therefore support the Government&#8217;s legislation for Scotland and the rest of the UK, but I should tell the Minister that the legislation by itself is not enough. We need to put in place a system that allows people to report when they are at risk of forced marriage, that encourages them to report, and that offers them the support they need. Currently, that is sadly lacking. For example, much more work needs to be done in schools, so that teachers are alert to the signs that a pupil might be being forced into marriage. Young people need to be educated so that, if they or one of their friends are at risk, they know where to seek help.</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/7">I therefore ask the Minister to say what the Government are doing to raise awareness of forced marriage. Where is the money to fund such a campaign? In 2012, the forced marriage unit said that many agencies, whether those dealing with children or with vulnerable adults, still did not recognise forced marriage as a safeguarding issue. That is totally unacceptable. There is evidence that police throughout the UK recognise the need to deal with forced marriage proactively, but other agencies&#8212;not just schools, but colleges and health organisations&#8212;still have a long way to go. I hope Ministers discuss the measures needed with the Scottish Government, so that we can develop a common approach throughout these islands.</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/8">We must have training not only for teachers to allow them to recognise the signs that their students are at risk, but for others. Teachers are important because, sometimes, they are the only person outside the family with whom a victim has contact at first. I remember the tragic case of Shafilea Ahmed in my area&#8212;she lived in the constituency of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40634" name="David Mowat">the hon. Member for Warrington South (David Mowat)</phrase>. She was so desperate that she drank bleach when she was taken to Pakistan. Later, she was missing for a week before anyone from the school raised the fact that she was not there, despite the warning signs she had given. Teachers did not intervene, and health workers did not follow up or ask the right questions. In the end, she was tragically murdered. I tell the Minister that, although the legislation is welcome, the Opposition want to know what he will do to ensure there is not another Shafilea.</p>
	<p pid="b.603.1/9">Social services provision is struggling because of the draconian cuts the Minister&#8217;s Government are making to council services. Women&#8217;s refuges have lost a third of their budget, and refuges and specialist advice services are closing. There is evidence that services that cater for women from black and ethnic minority communities are particularly hard hit. One test of the willingness of both the Scottish Government and the coalition Government to enforce the provisions will be whether they provide the services that people need.</p>

	<p pid="b.605.0/1">The hon. Gentleman needs to differentiate services that protect women from violence and specialist provision for those dealing with forced marriages. They are two parts of the same thing, but the current evidence is that specialised services for black and ethnic minority women&#8212;services that they feel more comfortable accessing because the people there understand the cultural background&#8212;are being closed at a greater rate than other refuges. That is a worry.</p>
	<p pid="b.605.0/2">My point to the Minister is that the legislation is all very well, but unfortunately, unless he ensures that there are services to allow women and girls to make use of the legislation and access the services they need, the Opposition will be forced to conclude that the Government will the ends but are unwilling to fund the means. We need a much more joined-up approach from the Home Office, the Department for Education, the Department of Health and the Department for Communities and Local Government if the legislation is to protect people in future. We do not oppose but welcome the Government&#8217;s new clauses, but that is the test we will apply to the Government.</p>

	<p pid="b.605.5/2">The Government proposals in the group are on the setting of fees for two distinct public services. New clause 10 concerns fees charged by the Disclosure and Barring Service. It is Government policy&#8212;I imagine and hope that this is supported by hon. Members on</p>
	<p pid="b.605.5/3">both sides of the House&#8212;to encourage volunteering in our communities. To that end, it has long been the case that criminal record checks, where needed, such as in respect of work with children, are provided free of charge to volunteers. The new clause puts on a clear statutory basis the ability of the Home Secretary to take into account the cost of providing criminal record certificates and other services covered by part V of the Police Act 1997 when determining the fees charged for those services.</p>

	<p pid="b.606.0/1">The Minister is making important points about ensuring that people are able to pay. As I understand it, it is not currently possible to get a basic disclosure within England and Wales&#8212;it has to go through Scotland. Will he look at ensuring that, where appropriate, basic applications are available and free?</p>

	<p pid="b.606.1/1">I am conscious that at various times there have been difficulties with the practicalities of the system, and I take on board my hon. Friend&#8217;s point.</p>
	<p pid="b.606.1/2">The other services covered by part V of the Police Act 1997 when determining fees charged for services also apply to the new update service that was launched earlier this year. This will enable employers to verify whether existing criminal record certificates for those signed up to the service remain up to date, allowing us to ensure that the overall costs of the service now provided by the disclosure and barring service are fully recovered through fee income, and not subsidised by the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="b.606.1/3">Earlier this year, when the update service was introduced, we made interim arrangements under the Finance (No. 2) Act 1987 to provide the legal gateway for this measure to apply. However, the overall arrangement was complex and not entirely transparent. For that reason, we believe the new clause will benefit volunteers and the people and communities they support.</p>
	<p pid="b.606.1/4">New clause 28 contains substantive provisions to replace clause 147, which, as we made clear, was a placeholder clause. The new clause provides the Lord Chancellor with a general power to set fees at a level that exceeds the cost of the related services. The services are those provided by the courts in England and Wales, including the Court of Protection, the tribunals for which the Lord Chancellor is responsible and the Office of the Public Guardian. The primary focus of our proposals for using this power will be the courts of England and Wales. The courts play a vital role in our society, providing access to justice so that the public can assert their legal rights. Ensuring that they are properly resourced is essential to maintaining access to justice. This must be delivered when public spending is required to fall&#8212;deficit reduction is one of the Government&#8217;s key priorities&#8212;and the courts and those who use them must make a contribution.</p>
	<p pid="b.606.1/5">As new clause 28 makes clear, the purpose of enhanced fees is to finance an efficient and effective court system. This change to the way that fees are set will help to ensure that courts are properly resourced to deliver modern, efficient services so that access to justice is protected. The proposed legislation provides a general power; specific fees would be increased through secondary legislation. When a specific fee or fees are set at an enhanced</p>
	<p pid="b.606.1/6">level for the first time, the order will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure&#8212;there will be full debate in both Houses. Any subsequent changes to those fees will be subject to the negative procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.606.1/7">We will shortly be consulting on proposals to achieve full cost recovery, less remissions, in the civil and family courts. However, even on this basis the running of the court system in England and Wales costs more than &#163;1 billion a year, so we need to go further in reducing the burden on taxpayers. We believe it is fair and proportionate that those who use the courts and can afford to do so should make a greater contribution to their overall funding. That is why we are bringing forward this provision to allow fees to be set above cost in some circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.606.1/8">Let me assure the House that we will not be using the power to set excessively high fees. In setting fees, the Lord Chancellor must have regard to the principle that access to the courts must not be denied. The new clause requires him to have regard to the overall financial position of the courts and tribunals, and the international competitiveness of the legal services market. We are not bringing forward specific plans for charging enhanced fees at this stage. We want to take some time to ensure that we get the measures right. As I said, we will consult widely on the proposals and look carefully at how any proposed court fees might compare with the overall cost of litigation, the value of the issues at stake and the fees charged by our international competitors. Following the consultation there will, as I have indicated, be full parliamentary scrutiny of any enhanced fees that we decide to introduce.</p>
	<p pid="b.606.1/9">Amendments 184 and 95 relate to the tests for eligibility for compensation following a miscarriage of justice. I propose that the House hears from the hon. Members who tabled them before I respond.</p>

	<p pid="b.608.0/1">I rise to speak on two matters; first, briefly, on enhanced fees. We are not opposed to the principle of what is being proposed, but it is clear from what the Minister has said that this is about more than full cost recovery, the kind for which we argued yesterday in respect of firearms. This is a revenue-raising measure. We will therefore scrutinise carefully any orders brought forward under the proposed legislation to ensure that any charges are reasonable, and that the interests of the administration of justice are best served.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/2">Amendment 95 relates to miscarriages of justice. I am proud to serve the city of Birmingham. In 1974, the city saw the most appalling terrorist outrage when, as a consequence of bombings by the Provisional IRA, 21 innocent citizens died. Six innocent people were then convicted of that terrorist outrage. I should make it clear that I have been a lifelong opponent of violence by the Provisional IRA. My mother and father were both Irish. I was also on the executive of the National Council for Civil Liberties for many years, and served as its chairman. In that period, we campaigned against terrorist violence and for justice at a time when it was sometimes difficult to stick one&#8217;s head up and say that what had happened to the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four was unacceptable. Sixteen years after the Birmingham Six were sent to prison, they were released and found to have been wrongly convicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/3">On behalf of the Opposition, I warmly welcome the fact that my hon. Friends the Members for Foyle (Mark Durkan) and for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) are bringing this important issue to the Floor of the House. We are rightly proud of our judicial system, but we know that it is not perfect. The Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four are but two examples of miscarriages of justice that highlight in extremis the consequences of getting it wrong; taking away years of a person&#8217;s life and damaging their reputation, their friends, family and colleagues. It is therefore entirely right that when such a miscarriage of justice occurs, the innocent people who have suffered are entitled to compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/4">At the heart of our legal system lies the principle of innocent until proved guilty, and rightly so. However, Government changes to redefine the compensation test, limiting it to</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/5">&#8220;if and only if the new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that the person was innocent of the offence&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/6">seem to fly in the face of this age-old principle. Under the Government&#8217;s new narrowed compensation tests, none of the Birmingham Six or Guildford Four would have been entitled to payments. Billy Power, one of the six men wrongly convicted in the 1970s for the Birmingham pub bombings, has warned that the changes would mean that</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/7">&#8220;the standard presumption of innocence would be abolished&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/8">And he is not alone. A report from the Westminster joint human rights commission said:</p>
	<p pid="b.608.0/9">&#8220;In our view, requiring proof of innocence beyond reasonable doubt as a condition of obtaining compensation for wrongful conviction is incompatible with the presumption of innocence, which is protected by both the common law and Article 6(2) ECHR. We recommend that clause 143 be deleted from the Bill because it is on its face incompatible with the Convention.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.609.0/1">As the hon. Gentleman will hear if I have a chance to say a word, I am very supportive of what he is arguing for and of the amendment that his hon. Friends have tabled. With respect, though, I would like to correct something that he said. The opinion that he just quoted was that of the Joint Committee on Human Rights&#8212;not the Westminster convention, or whatever he called it&#8212;which is making exactly the argument that he is putting to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.609.1/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for his intervention; he is of course right.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.1/2">We support a rigorous and fair justice system, but it must ensure that where a serious miscarriage of justice has happened, innocent people receive fair compensation for all that they have suffered, which, in the more extreme cases, can involve years of their lives. If a miscarriage of justice has taken place, it is the justice system&#8217;s mistake, and it should be its job to put it right, not to make it harder for innocent people to do so. If&#8212;God forbid!&#8212;we ever saw a repeat of what happened with the Birmingham bombings and the subsequent convictions, it would be absolutely unthinkable that those people would not be entitled to compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.1/3">I very much hope that the Minister will respond constructively to the amendment and our representations. We intend to support the amendment in the other place, where we believe that further detailed scrutiny should take place, because the Government have got it wrong and we must put that wrong right.</p>

	<p pid="b.609.2/1">It is a pleasure to speak in this debate and to follow the opening comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/2">I thoroughly support new clause 10, because it is right that we recognise volunteers. Too often, people have had to pay far too much to go through the processes necessary to volunteer, as I know from my own voluntary work, although that was more of a problem when people needed separate certificates for everything they did. I am glad that we have made some progress at least.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/3">There is an issue, however, about the availability of the right level of disclosure for criminal record certificates. I thought I knew this area reasonably well, but I did not realise until recently that it was not possible to get a basic certificate&#8212;there are three levels: basic, standard and enhanced&#8212;listing unspent convictions in England and Wales; the only body that does it is Disclosure Scotland. While getting the pricing correct, therefore, we must also ensure availability. It seems perverse that only under Scots law can somebody get what most employers ought to have access to. Most employers do not realise that they should have the basic, rather than standard or enhanced certificate. I hope that Ministers will consider that point and ensure that while providing the right costings, we also get that right, and that the Government implement the relevant provisions in the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act 1974.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/4">On new clause 28, the Minister made a strong case for having some fees. I think we would all agree that if a Russian oligarch makes great use of our courts, they should make some contribution. None of us would suggest that their having to pay &#163;1,000 or so would inhibit their ability to get justice. Perhaps the cost of using the courts should be a fraction of the fees going to the lawyers; that might be a safe way of ensuring that</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/5">we make our fair share. That is not the route chosen, however, although it is quite tempting, given how large the legal fees are in many of these cases. It is not just Russian oligarchs, of course; it is anybody with a very big transaction. It seems right that they should contribute to the costs of our fantastic court system.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/6">We need to ensure, however, that people not in a position to pay are not hit. It should still be possible for people without money to access the courts, and in that, the fees system could help, because by taking more money from those who have lots of it, we could subsidise those who do not. I note that there is broad support for the idea that any money made should be reinvested in improving our court system and ensuring that it works well. Broadly, therefore, I am pleased to see the new clause.</p>
	<p pid="b.609.2/7">Clause 143 has been discussed passionately by the shadow Minister and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>. I share their huge concern about effectively requiring somebody to demonstrate their innocence, which in very many cases would be extremely hard to prove to the level required. It is not hard to think of cases where it would have been problematic; the shadow Minister described some of them, and I will not detain the House with a long list, but people have written to me with examples.</p>

	<p pid="b.610.1/1">It is nice to be encouraged by the Whips to speak at greater length, but I am sure we have enough to debate and I do not want to take time from the important debates coming up.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.1/2">On the concerns about clause 143, the hon. Member for Islington North has, of course, tabled his amendment, but the Joint Committee on Human Rights has also tabled an amendment that would get rid of the clause completely. I am not a lawyer, but my assessment is that the JCHR approach is probably a cleaner one, but both amendments aim to achieve exactly the same thing. I agree with the shadow Minister that we should flag this up as a big issue, but leave it to the other place to find the right answer. By then, I hope that the Government will have reflected on it and accepted the principle that it is incredibly hard for anybody absolutely to prove their innocence. That is a really tough threshold. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that and that we can strike a better balance in the other place.</p>

	<p pid="b.610.2/1">I will be brief; because of the odd timetable we have for the Bill, there is not much time to debate any of it. My remarks are concerned solely with amendment 95, which stands in my name and that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40264" name="Mark Durkan">the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase>, and for which, as my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" name="Jack Dromey">the Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)</phrase> explained, there is strong support.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/2">Clause 143 will fundamentally overturn the huge changes made after the release of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four. For many years, along with Chris Mullin and many others, I was one of those who, from this position in the House, raised questions about the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four, and I could paper the walls of my house with the letters of</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/3">abuse we received for taking up their cases. None of us who took up those miscarriages of justice was ever in favour of the bombing and killing of civilians in any circumstances; we were, however, in favour of justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.610.2/4">The first person arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1974 was Paul Hill, one of the Guildford Four, who had been a constituent of my constituency before I was elected, but was in prison when I was elected. Meeting him and the others in prison, I was struck by the sheer hopelessness of being locked up for an offence they did not commit, when every newspaper and commentator in the country said they were guilty and when their family members were abused in the street and vilified because they had a son, nephew or cousin in prison for an offence they did not commit. It made that campaign very difficult, but some very brave people stood up, and eventually those happy days when they were finally released brought about a fundamental change in the whole narrative of justice in this country.</p>

	<p pid="b.611.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Gentleman on his work on this issue over many years; it is a great tribute to him that he took it seriously. Does he agree that a fundamental principle underlies this point, which is that no matter what somebody has been accused of, however heinous it might be, they are still entitled to due process and due legal protections? That is an essential principle from which we should not vary, whether a person be accused of terrorist activities, sex crimes or anything else. Due process is important, because errors are made.</p>

	<p pid="b.611.1/1">The hon. Gentleman is absolutely correct. However heinous the crime, however vile the accusation against an individual, unless they are treated as innocent until proven guilty, we undermine everything we believe in as a democratic society.</p>
	<p pid="b.611.1/2">The big change that came after the release of the Birmingham Six and the Guildford Four&#8212;and Judith Ward for that matter&#8212;was the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which immediately started looking at 600 miscarriage of justice cases that had not received the sort of publicity that we had managed to engender in the three cases I just mentioned.</p>

	<p pid="b.611.3/1">Absolutely. I recall that campaign very well. Although I was not centrally involved in it, I certainly supported it.</p>
	<p pid="b.611.3/2">The question really goes back to the Minister. I intervened on him during his opening remarks to give him a chance&#8212;a double chance; not double jeopardy, but a double chance&#8212;to provide us with good reasons why he is introducing a provision that we, along with Liberty and many others, believe will fundamentally undermine much of what has been achieved through the Criminal Cases Review Commission and by the ability to overturn miscarriages of justice.</p>
	<p pid="b.611.3/3">Justice can go wrong. The media can get it wrong. There can be a campaign of vilification that gets it wrong. We should not be too holier than thou in this country as we already have a considerable number of people held indefinitely under immigration law, and we have anti-terror laws that I believe are highly questionable in many ways when it comes to justice. I hope that the Minister will explain in his reply exactly how a serious campaign on a miscarriage of justice case would be dealt with in the future and how many more people could indeed be locked up for a long period for offences that they did not commit and could not have committed.</p>
	<p pid="b.611.3/4">If amendment 95 is not accepted&#8212;I support the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington that the whole of clause 143 be deleted&#8212;I hope that the House of Lords will look at the provisions in forensic detail. Many of those who did such incredible work, including Baroness Helena Kennedy, in representing these causes and cases over many years, sit in the other place and I hope they will ensure that this legislation is fundamentally changed so that we recognise that mistakes can happen, that terrible injustices can take place and that unless we provide the opportunity and ability to remedy them, they will happen again and again and again. That is very dangerous in any democratic society.</p>

	<p pid="b.612.0/1">I apologise to you, Mr Speaker, to the Minister and to colleagues because I had to slip out briefly at the beginning of this debate, albeit for what I hope are appropriate reasons. I had to meet a press deadline to pay tribute to one of our party members&#8212;not a parliamentarian, but a man called Stan Hardy who had been a great campaigner on these sorts of issues. He died last Thursday at the ripe old age of 93. Not just Liberal Democrats or liberals but Labour and Conservative colleagues in London and beyond recognised Stan as a doughty campaigner for civil liberties as well as for the rights of the under-privileged.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/2">It is always a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> on these sorts of issues, and I join my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase> in paying tribute to his doughty campaigning throughout all the time he and I have been together in the place&#8212;now more than 30 years in both our cases. The hon. Gentleman&#8217;s amendment, supported by his hon. Friends, is designed to deal with a wrong in this Bill that I hope we can remedy.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/3">There is a difference between amendment 95, tabled by the hon. Member for Islington North, and amendment 184, tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40034" name="Hywel Francis">the hon. Member for Aberavon (Dr Francis)</phrase> and me. We argue for our amendment in our own right, but also on behalf of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Amendment 95 would amend clause 143, taking out from line 26 the words</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/4">&#8220;the person was innocent of the offence&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/5">and inserting the words</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/6">&#8220;no reasonable court properly directed as to the law, could convict on the evidence now to be considered.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/7">The Joint Committee&#8217;s collective view was that we would do better to remove clause 143 as a whole&#8212;exactly the issue for which <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" name="Jack Dromey">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)</phrase> argued. I have been here long enough to remember and to have supported numerous campaigns to deal with miscarriages of justice, many of them very unpopular for the reasons we have all identified. Having looked at the issue again, I honestly believe that</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/8">the removal of the clause would be the better way to deal with the problem. There are technical problems with amendment 95, so I strongly commend to the Minister the amendment to remove clause 143.</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/9">Finally, I shall not press the Joint Committee&#8217;s amendment to a vote, but we feel strongly about this issue as a Committee. I am sure the Minister knows that we will listen respectfully to what he says, but I hope he can be helpful and confirm that the principle of the Government&#8217;s proposal&#8212;that the provision should apply</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/10">&#8220;if and only if the new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that the person was innocent&#8221;&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.612.0/11">will be changed because that is not the test that should be applied to deal with miscarriages of justice.</p>

	<p pid="b.613.0/1">I, too, rise to speak to amendment 95, to which my name is attached, along with that of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/2">As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase>and others have said, the history of serious cases of miscarriages of justice should bear very heavily indeed on all Members. I include in that the cases that were fought, promoted and championed against very difficult headwinds here in Parliament by Members of all parties. I recall Conservative Members like the late John Biggs-Davison and others championing those cases alongside Labour and Liberal MPs&#8212;but little thanks did they get for it from sections of the media and others.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/3">My own predecessors and party colleagues in Parliament fought on those issues at that time. I remember working in John Hume&#8217;s office writing all sorts of letters to the Home Office. Of course, we were told that new facts and new evidence did not qualify as new facts and new evidence. Perhaps that issue still applies to clause 143. Even if amendment 95 were accepted, the question of what counts as a</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/4">&#8220;new or newly discovered fact&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/5">still arises, although I hope that the wording of the amendment, which would provide that</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/6">&#8220;no reasonable court properly directed as to the law, could convict on the evidence now to be considered&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/7">would help. There were historical arguments about whether new evidence was indeed a new fact or a material consideration, and I would not want to legislate to produce more circular arguments or obfuscations like that for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/8">Clause 143 is pernicious. It seeks completely to reload the basic, long-standing presumption of innocence until proven guilty. It basically provides qualification of the notion of a miscarriage of justice, suggesting that when someone has suffered what most people would call a miscarriage of justice and when their conviction has, on subsequent judicial appraisal of relevant evidence, been overturned, they should still not be able to proclaim their innocence. There is an insinuation that if they were previously convicted, they are innocent and entitled to compensation as innocent only where they can prove that they are innocent &#8220;beyond reasonable doubt&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/9">For the people affected, many of their convictions will have taken place many years previously and they will be in no position to marshal all the evidence that could necessarily prove their innocence beyond what someone would call a reasonable doubt. Nobody has to</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/10">meet that criterion at their proper and due initial trial, so why should anybody have to do that to receive compensation after a conviction has been overturned? Compensation is not the only issue here because it is not the monetary value that motivates the fundamental objections to this proposal.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/11">Before I became a Member in 2005, I worked on the cases of the Guildford Four and the Maguire Seven when they still needed and wanted a full and proper proclamation of their innocence, not least because many sections of the media and others were retelling the slur that these people had somehow secured just a technical acquittal. Their conviction was quashed, but the insinuation remained that they were not really innocent. That problem arose from issues surrounding compensation and other factors.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/12">I recall being asked by Gerry Conlon, a friend of mine and one of the Guildford Four, if I could get a direct and clear statement of apology and a proclamation of the innocence not just of himself but of his late father, Giuseppe Conlon. I was also asked the same by Sarah Conlon, Gerry&#8217;s mother and Giuseppe&#8217;s widow. It was plain that Gerry Conlon wanted that clear proclamation of their innocence for his mother, that his mother wanted it for Gerry, and, of course, that they both wanted it for Giuseppe.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/13">It is hugely important for people to be able to engage in the proper legal process in order to have their innocence properly affirmed. They should not have to engage in all sorts of ulterior processes to secure, for instance, declarations in the House of Commons or in the precincts of Parliament, which is what happened at the time to which I have referred. We must recognise that miscarriages of justice have had a fundamental impact not just on the people whose lives have been marred and blighted by years of jail and the ignominy that they and their families have suffered, but on the wider community&#8212;and not just in the context of British-Irish relations and all those historic difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/14">It is mean-minded of the Government to use the Bill to try to qualify the definition of whether people have been victims of miscarriages of justice, and to impose an undue burden on them to prove their innocence &#8220;beyond reasonable doubt&#8221;. Those words were chosen very deliberately. How can any of us prove our innocence of anything beyond reasonable doubt? Many of us might be accused of saying things, insinuating things, meaning things, or doing things relating to our expenses or all sorts of other things, but it would be enormously difficult for us then to prove beyond reasonable doubt that we had not done those things, particularly if we had been subject to a lot of media reportage, profiling and distorted coverage. It is beyond me to imagine why the Government chose to use such wording.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/15">In amendment 95, my hon. Friend the Member for Islington North and I seek to modify the damage done by clause 143, proposing that the words</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/16">&#8220;the person was innocent of the offence&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/17">after the words</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/18">&#8220;if and only if the new or newly discovered fact shows beyond reasonable doubt that&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/19">should be replaced by the words</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/20">&#8220;no reasonable court properly directed as to the law, could convict on the evidence now to be considered&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/21">I think that that is an important and measured qualification.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/22">I also agree with what was said by the right hon. Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark on behalf of the Joint Committee. In many respects, clause 143 as a whole is the problem. I certainly am not minded to become involved in a contest relating to whether the House should divide on whether to keep the whole clause or on whether to amend it in the way suggested by amendment 95. On the basis of what I have heard from Liberal Democrat Members, as well as the important statements that we have heard from the Opposition Front Bench, I will say that&#8212;although my party has no Members in the House of Lords, and will have none until it has become a reformed and democratic Chamber&#8212;if there are other worthy heads there that are able to concentrate on this clause in its fullest and important sense, I shall give them every encouragement to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/23">We cannot treat this issue lightly. The Government may say, &#8220;It is all about the compensation culture: it is simply about cutting costs.&#8221; They may say that they do not want compensation to be automatically provided in cases with which people might not be comfortable because they might find the recipient unattractive, and because it might relate to a crime about which there was a great deal of deep and understandable public feeling. However, none of those considerations should allow us to indulge a clause that would fundamentally tilt the presumption of innocence&#8212;that would tilt the balance away from someone&#8217;s guilt having to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. People who have been convicted and deemed guilty may be able to challenge that decision subsequently, but, even if they are released, they may in a sense be unable to escape from the original conviction.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/24">Inherent in the Government&#8217;s proposal is the notion that the fact that someone is not guilty does not necessarily mean that that person is innocent, which is a very dangerous wedge to start inserting in public assumptions and perceptions. However, it is what we as legislators are being asked to do, and the hon. Member for Islington North and I tabled amendment 95 so that we could register our view properly today. We hope that it will be registered further, in terms such as those that we have already heard from the Opposition Front Bench and, indeed, from some on the Government Benches.</p>
	<p pid="b.613.0/25">I hope that the Minister is sensitive to some of the issues that have been raised&#8212;not just in relation to cases that have already happened, but in relation to those that may happen in the future&#8212;and to the deep concern that is felt about the possibility that the &#8220;tilting&#8221; is part of some other ulterior agenda. This is certainly not something that we can allow to pass lightly, and I shall listen very carefully to what the Minister says.</p>

	<p pid="b.615.0/1">I will support amendment 184, or, failing that, amendment 95.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/2">Clause 143 in its present form marks a significant and hugely detrimental shift in the law which would make it far more difficult for individuals to gain compensation for wrongful conviction and imprisonment. Non-governmental organisations concerned with human rights, including the Committee on the Administration of Justice, as well as highly respected organisations such as Justice and Liberty, have expressed major anxieties about the clause. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40264" name="Mark Durkan">the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan)</phrase> explained very eloquently, an individual who applies for compensation for a miscarriage of justice must currently demonstrate that a court could not have established</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/3">beyond reasonable doubt that he or she was guilty of the offence. Clause 143, however, shifts the burden of proof to the individual, and compels that individual to prove that he or she is innocent of the offence. A miscarriage of justice would henceforth be proved to have taken place only if newly discovered facts showed beyond reasonable doubt that that person was innocent.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/4">As Justice has pointed out, since 2006 section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 has provided the only avenue for individuals to obtain financial redress after miscarriages of justice have occurred. It is chilling to think that, had the proposed change in the law been in place at the time, none of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the Maguire Seven or the Cardiff Three&#8212;I have some interest in that case, and indeed referred to it earlier&#8212;would have satisfied the innocence test.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/5">Those infamous cases, of course, paved the way for the establishment of the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The individuals involved won compensation because it was proved that the evidence that had been brought against them was flawed, and that a jury could not have found them guilty had the case been retried. As was made clear by the hon. Member for Foyle, the justice system of England and Wales is unlike the Scottish system in that a case cannot be found to be &#8220;not proven&#8221;, although there have been arguments about that position.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/6">In the notorious cases that I have just listed, the rule of thumb for the awarding of compensation was always that the individuals would receive the amount that they would have earned had they been working during the time when they were wrongfully imprisoned. The purpose of that was to ensure that they would not be impoverished when they were released. It would be wicked indeed to deny individuals that compensation when the justice system has gone wrong.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/7">Under the current law, it is already exceptionally difficult to persuade the criminal Court of Appeal to review new evidence. For cases to qualify, the Criminal Cases Review Commission is required to apply section 13(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995, which provides that individuals must satisfy a &#8220;real possibility test&#8221;. Arguably, both the Criminal Cases Review Court and the Court of Appeal adopt an excessively strict interpretation of this test. They restrict reviews to new evidence that was not available at the time of the trial or appeal, which means in practice that evidence that was available at the time of the trial or appeal cannot be considered, even in cases in which it was suppressed by the police. Given how difficult it is to get cases referred to the Court of Appeal under both the &#8220;real possibility test&#8221; and the need for fresh evidence, it is harsh indeed that the Government are attempting further to restrict people&#8217;s ability to gain compensation. Innocence is far too high a test and would be virtually impossible to prove after many years, which is when such cases are usually heard.</p>
	<p pid="b.615.0/8">If this matter is not pressed to a successful Division this afternoon, I sincerely hope that Members in the other place will apply the most stringent attention to the clause. My noble Friend Lord Wigley will certainly do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.616.0/1">I am grateful to be called, Mr Speaker. Thank you for letting me speak in the debate. I appreciate that my role as a shadow law Minister means that it is an indulgence to allow me to speak. I appreciate it.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/2">I have been in the House for eight years and I thought that I was unshockable, but the way in which the Government are seeking to amend section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 to redefine a miscarriage of justice is truly shocking. They wish to change it so that, if and only if newly discovered facts show beyond reasonable doubt that the person is innocent, there has been a miscarriage of justice. Nothing less than that will do. Only in those circumstances can someone be given compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/3">I am sure that the Minister will have noted, as anyone else watching the debate will have done, that no one has yet spoken in favour of clause 143, not even the Minister himself yet. If the matter is not dealt with this afternoon, I hope that there will be the opportunity to deal with it in another place. We need to marshal our forces, because the essence of our liberal society is threatened.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/4">The Government&#8217;s arguments for introducing an innocence test&#8212;there are many arguments; I want to concentrate on the Government&#8217;s justification&#8212;are, first, that it is needed for the sake of clarity; and, secondly, that it will save money. Neither of those arguments is remotely convincing. Let me turn to the first, about clarity.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/5">The law at the moment is perfectly clear. Three recent authoritative judgments have rejected the innocence test as an affront to the presumption of innocence. The Supreme Court did so in the case of Adams in 2011, in which Lady Hale said:</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/6">&#8220;a person is only guilty if the state can prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt...He does not have to prove his innocence at his trial and it seems wrong in principle that he should be required to prove his innocence now.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/7">That was reiterated in the High Court in the case of Ali earlier this year. There was an attempt to widen the definition, but that attempt was well and truly quashed by the High Court. This summer, moreover, the European Court of Human Rights, in the case of Allen <i>v.</i> the UK, made it perfectly clear that any legislation that calls into question the innocence of an acquitted person would be a breach of article 6(2) of the European convention on human rights on the presumption of innocence.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/8">Therefore, the law is clear. That law has been reiterated by our own Joint Committee on Human Rights, which has been able to assert that</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/9">&#8220;it is now clear beyond doubt&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/10">that the proposed new test in clause 143 is incompatible with the right to be presumed innocent in article 6(2). Therefore, rather than clarifying the law, it seems that the Government are having a pitched battle with the settled, established law.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/11">The second argument is about saving money. The Bill&#8217;s own impact assessment reveals the expected savings to be negligible. According to that MOJ assessment&#8212;the Minister looks puzzled; it is on page 4&#8212;the effect of the clause will be to reduce by two per annum the number of judicial reviews of Secretary of State decisions, which it estimates will save around &#163;100,000 per annum. Therefore, for the sake of saving &#163;100,000 per annum, we will be trading in the centuries-old principle of the presumption of innocence. The courts have rejected an innocence test not out of some quibbling legalistic technicality. They have rejected it because it is a cornerstone of a fair</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/12">justice system. We have a fair justice system and a free society where it is for the state to prove guilt, not for the individual to prove innocence.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/13">The reason for that is obvious. Proving a negative is very difficult and the burden of proof it would place on the individual is extremely onerous. It is for the state with all its resources to make the case of a person&#8217;s guilt. The presumption of innocence applies before an acquittal. As Lord Phillips said in the Adams case, any test that requires innocence</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/14">&#8220;will deprive some defendants who are in fact innocent and who succeed in having their convictions quashed on the grounds of fresh evidence from obtaining compensation. It will exclude from entitlement to compensation those who no longer seem likely to be guilty, but whose innocence is not established beyond reasonable doubt. This is a heavy price to pay for ensuring that no guilty person is ever the recipient of compensation&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/15">It is unfair and unreasonable to demand that, after years of being wrongfully imprisoned, an acquitted person should produce some evidential rabbit out of a hat that proves beyond doubt their innocence. They should be able to seek redress for the years of their lives that have been wasted and the years in which they have been the victim of abuse of state power. It is wrong for them to be expected to come out of prison after 16 years, turn into some sort of Inspector Clouseau and find some nugget that will prove beyond doubt that they are innocent. In most cases, that will be a technical impossibility, given the amount of time that will have elapsed since their imprisonment. That means that it will often be the most deserving and the longest suffering who are denied compensation. The point has already been made that the Birmingham Six would not have been able to get justice and compensation under the test that the Government are proposing.</p>
	<p pid="b.616.0/16">This proposed change is wrong and we need to ensure, either in this place or in the other place, that it does not pass into law. There seems to be general agreement on both sides of the House among those who are against the change that another place may be the best place to deal with it. We wish Members in another place the best of luck.</p>

	<p pid="b.618.0/1">This has been a serious debate, appropriately, because these are serious issues. Having listened carefully to the views of Members on both sides of the House, I believe that there are some genuine misunderstandings about what is proposed and what its effect will be. I will seek to deal with those as briefly as I can. It is a complex issue.</p>
	<p pid="b.618.0/2">As we have heard, amendment 95 seeks to maintain the current definition of a &#8220;miscarriage of justice&#8221; derived from case law, which is therefore subject to ongoing litigation. Amendment 184 goes further and would prevent us from creating a statutory definition of a &#8220;miscarriage of justice&#8221; at all, leaving the definition subject to the shifting view of the courts. Over the years, the courts have provided complicated definitions of a miscarriage of justice, which are often confusing to a lay person and are by definition subject to change over time. In this instance, it is unlikely that an applicant for compensation would know what</p>
	<p pid="b.618.0/3">&#8220;properly directed as to the law&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.618.0/4">means in a particular case. That would have disadvantages for applicants, who will find it difficult to know whether they have a valid claim, or to understand the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision on their case.</p>

	<p pid="b.619.0/1">Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that, although there has been a challenge in respect of the case of Adams in the Supreme Court, the position has not moved and the law on the definition of miscarriage of justice has been settled since 2011?</p>

	<p pid="b.619.1/1">I will come to the Adams case in a moment, if the hon. Lady will be patient.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.1/2">Many disappointed applicants seek judicial review of the Secretary of State&#8217;s decision, because they do not fully understand its basis or because the case law is unclear. In practice, very few such claims succeed, and they place a significant burden on the applicant involved and on the taxpayers who have to fund them. Therefore, the purpose of clause 143 is to restore the law to the pre-2011 position and to make the definition of a miscarriage of justice more consistent, clearer and easier for the public and potential applicants to understand. That is fairer than using an obscure and confusing definition, or continuing to work, as we have to now, with a definition that is subject to unpredictable change. We are firmly of the view that the provision is compatible with our international obligations and the convention rights. I am conscious that we are in discussions with the Joint Committee about that and that we hold different views on the matter.</p>

	<p pid="b.619.2/1">Although this issue is being dealt with very carefully, there is clearly a difference of view, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40335" name="Emily Thornberry">the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry)</phrase> made the case for the legal justification. Rather than just have a battle at the other end of the building and a lottery of an outcome, will my right hon. Friend undertake to facilitate a meeting of all those interested in both Houses with members of the relevant Committees so that we can hear evidence and try to do the job properly, and see whether the Government have adopted the right position or we need to do something else? I would far rather we got it right and were really clear and all signed up than we had a maverick outcome that satisfied very few or nobody.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.619.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="619"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0002.htm#131015-0002.htm_spnew4">
	<p pid="b.619.3/1">I am happy to continue to engage in the discussions that the Departments have been having with the Joint Committee or anyone else, but I regret to say that I am not sure that having a meeting at which a definitive view could be arrived at would be possible, as that would be subcontracting the right of Parliament to be that Chamber&#8212;that is the purpose of this House and the other place, and I do not think it is constitutionally right to try to subcontract that to a meeting of experts.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.3/2">The nub of Members&#8217; complaints about clause 143 is that it is in some way incompatible with the presumption of innocence&#8212;I do not think I am traducing hon. Members in saying that&#8212;and that is the issue we need to address. Of course the Government recognise the fundamental constitutional importance of the presumption of innocence and we would not introduce legislation</p>
	<p pid="b.619.3/3">that cuts across that. We consider that article 14.6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which section 133 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 gives effect, provides only for compensation to be paid to those persons whose convictions have been overturned because a new fact shows that they did not commit the offence. In the Government&#8217;s view, that is the proper definition of a miscarriage of justice. Compensation should not be payable where the basis for the conviction being overturned does not demonstrate the applicant&#8217;s innocence.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.3/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40335" name="Emily Thornberry">The hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry)</phrase> brought up the European Court of Human Rights. We are aware of its decision on this issue and we have written in some detail to the Joint Committee on Human Rights about it. However, we continue to consider that this provision would not interfere with a person&#8217;s fundamental right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. We take firm support for this view from the Supreme Court in the Adams case, which held unanimously that the presumption of innocence is not infringed by the current arrangements for compensating a miscarriage of justice. In our view, the proposed change does not alter that analysis. As the European Court acknowledged, more than an acquittal is required to establish that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Through clause 143, we are determining where that line should be drawn.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.3/5">Under clause 143, there is no requirement for a person applying for compensation for a miscarriage of justice to &#8220;prove&#8221; their innocence. What is determinative is the fact on which the conviction was overturned. So, for example, if a person&#8217;s conviction is overturned because DNA evidence comes to light showing they could not have committed the offence, it is only right that they should be compensated. Following the coming into force of clause 143, they will, as now, be eligible for compensation.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.3/6">The proposed new test for determining eligibility for compensation does not require the applicant to demonstrate his or her innocence; it focuses on the new fact. When the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled in the case of Allen that the presumption of innocence is engaged when deciding whether to pay compensation for a miscarriage of justice, the Court made it clear that states were entitled to conclude that more than an acquittal was required. This clause will enable us to say, for the first time in statute, what beyond an acquittal is necessary for there to have been a miscarriage of justice. It introduces for the first time some certainty in the process.</p>
	<p pid="b.619.3/7">I should say in response to a point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40334" name="Jeremy Corbyn">the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn)</phrase> that the clause will have no impact at all on the very valuable work being done every day by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and nor will it change the basis on which a conviction is overturned.</p>

	<p pid="b.620.1/1">Yes, indeed, and I have addressed directly the cases the hon. Lady raised.</p>
	<p pid="b.620.1/2">We are returning the law to where it was in 2008 under the previous Government, where following the decision of the House of Lords in Mullen, compensation was held to be payable only where a person could be shown not to have committed, or to have been demonstrably innocent of, the offence for which he was convicted.</p>
	<p pid="b.620.1/3">As has been pointed out by the Supreme Court in Adams, it is difficult to glean exactly what the framers of the ICCPR intended on this point from the papers now available, and nor is there international consensus on what the ICCPR requires in this regard. Signatories to the ICCPR have some latitude in determining the requirements of article 14.6. For example. New Zealand and Canada restrict the payment of compensation for a miscarriage of justice to cases where the applicant was innocent. Further, while the Supreme Court in Adams ultimately held that eligibility for compensation was not limited to cases of innocence, four members of the Supreme Court, including the current Lord Chief Justice, considered that compensation should be payable only in cases of innocence. We are therefore confident that what we are doing achieves the aim of creating a more readily comprehensible test which meets the Government&#8217;s policy objectives, while also complying with our international obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.620.1/4">We recognise the fundamental constitutional importance of the presumption of innocence, and there may simply be a disagreement in this Chamber as to whether we are breaching it, but I can assure the House that there is no intention of doing so, and I am firmly of the belief that clause 143 does not do that. All it does is require compensation to be paid to those persons whose convictions have been overturned because a new fact shows that they did not in fact commit the offence. This, in the Government&#8217;s view, is the proper definition to be given to a miscarriage of justice</p>
	<p pid="b.620.1/5">I hope I have cleared up what I think are genuine misunderstandings about the effect of clause 143, and I urge the Members concerned to withdraw their amendments.</p>

	<p pid="b.622.1/2">New clause 16&#8212;<i>Control of new psychoactive substances&#8212;</i></p>
	<p pid="b.622.1/3">&#8216;(1) Any person supplying, or offering to supply, a synthetic psychoactive substance including but not restricted to&#8212;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.626.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="626"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0002.htm#131015-0002.htm_spnew9">
	<p pid="b.626.0/1">I propose to run through the Government amendments in this group briskly, so that other Members can speak to their amendments. Given the linkage to the Government amendments on low-value shop theft, I also intend to touch on amendment 136 tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase>. With the leave of the House, I propose to respond to the other non-Government amendments in this group when winding up.</p>
	<p pid="b.626.0/2">New clause 11 follows up a debate in Committee initiated by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40436" name="Stephen Barclay">the Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay)</phrase>, who raised some important points about the powers of police community support officers. In particular, he proposed that two new powers should be conferred on PCSOs: first, that they should be able to issue a fixed penalty notice for riding a bicycle without lights; and, secondly, that they should be able to search someone for controlled drugs.</p>
	<p pid="b.626.0/3">I gave a commitment to consider my hon. Friend&#8217;s proposals over the summer, in the context of the specific role that PCSOs play in our communities. As my hon. Friend pointed out, there is an inconsistency in PCSOs&#8217; powers around cycling. They can issue a penalty notice for riding on a footway, but not for riding without lights. Extending their powers in respect of cycling, as provided for in new clause 11, would end this anomaly and complement their important engagement role. Being on foot patrol, they are well-placed within their communities to increase awareness and educate people about the importance of cycle safety. Backing this up with the power to issue a penalty notice could enhance the impact they have in their neighbourhoods.</p>
	<p pid="b.626.0/4">The power to search for controlled dugs is more complicated. We do need to keep a clear distinction between the role of a PCSO and that of a constable. We need to be mindful of the risk that new powers could increase the element of confrontation in the role of PCSOs and detract from their presence on the streets. It is vital that we get this right and, accordingly, we are still considering whether such an expansion of powers is appropriate. I assure my hon. Friend that I will let him and the House know the outcome of that consideration as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.626.0/5">Amendments 51 to 55, 65, 70, 71, 77 and 84 to 86 simply make various consequential amendments to the provisions in the Bill relating to the creation of the police remuneration review body, which will operate in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to take account of the fact that the Scottish Government have now introduced their own legislation to establish the police negotiating board for Scotland. The amendments ensure</p>
	<p pid="b.626.0/6">that various statutory references to the Police Negotiating Board for the United Kingdom which are being amended by the Bill, will now apply to the PNB for Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="b.626.0/7">Amendments 79 to 81 relate to the new powers to seize invalid travel documents. They do not change the powers, but simply improve the drafting to ensure that there is absolute clarity. The amendments clarify that, although a constable, immigration officer or a designated customs official may authorise a person to carry out a search for travel documents on their behalf at a port, this power may only be exercised away from a port by a constable. The amendment restates that reasonable force may be used if necessary when exercising the new search and seizure powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.626.0/8">On low-value shop theft, clause 144 is intended to improve the management through the courts of the high volume of shop thefts involving goods to the value of &#163;200 or less by enabling them to benefit from procedures applying to summary only cases. In particular, offenders will be able to plead guilty by post and, in turn, the police will be able to prosecute suitable cases directly as &#8220;specified proceedings&#8221;, without the need to involve the Crown Prosecution Service. That will simplify procedures and enable swifter justice in such cases. Although clause 144 makes low-value shop theft &#8220;summary only&#8221;, it preserves the defendant&#8217;s right to be tried at the Crown Court, through subsection (2) of new section 22A of the Magistrates&#8217; Courts Act 1980. Amendment 136, tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley, would remove that subsection. The Government have been clear that they will defend the right to trial by jury; it is an historic freedom that is rightly protected by the coalition&#8217;s programme for government. Although the statistics suggest that the right is not often exercised in cases of shop theft&#8212;last year, only 700 out of 77,000 cases went to the Crown Court&#8212;we see no reason to depart from that general principle. In this instance, I urge my hon. Friend to reconsider his amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.626.0/9">Government amendments 61, 69 and 73 are consequential on those changes. Amendment 61 will ensure that a range of powers in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 available to the police and others to deal with indictable offences, which currently includes all theft from shops, will remain available to deal with the theft of goods of a value of &#163;200 or less. That means that magistrates will still be able to issue search warrants, the police will be able to enter premises to search for evidence or arrest suspects, and store detectives will still be able to arrest suspects. I hope that that provides some reassurance to some retailers that I know have been anxious about this. The amendment also ensures that the equivalent PACE provisions applying to service personnel are similarly amended to preserve relevant powers of investigation. This will ensure that cases of shop theft can continue to be investigated and pursued appropriately and rigorously by the police, while providing that where individuals are to be prosecuted in court, that can be done more efficiently and effectively.</p>

	<p pid="b.627.0/1">I wish to speak to new clauses 27, 26 and 16 and, given the time available, I will do so as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.627.0/2">Today, in another place, the remarkable Doreen Lawrence will be ennobled. Twenty years ago her son was cruelly murdered. The son of Neville, a carpenter, and Doreen, a special needs teacher, Stephen was but 18 years old,</p>
	<p pid="b.627.0/3">excelling at school and at sport, and with a whole life ahead of him, when he was cruelly murdered by racists. To add insult to injury&#8212;I say this with regret&#8212;there was clear evidence of racism in the way in which the police inquiry was conducted. As if that were not bad enough, serious allegations have now been made that the police then spied on the Lawrence family with a view to discrediting them. That has prompted the ongoing Operation Herne.</p>
	<p pid="b.627.0/4">What happened to the Lawrence family is not the only situation that gives rise to concern. I am thinking, for example, of the long-running infiltration of peaceful protesters in the environmental movement by Mark Kennedy; serious questions have been asked about the accountability of the undercover police operation that was undertaken. Let me make myself clear: undercover policing is vital in the fight against serious organised crime and terrorism, and is a key part of the police&#8217;s ability to keep communities safe. I pay tribute to the work done by brave police officers in dangerous and often difficult circumstances. However, undercover operations are also incredibly sensitive and have a substantial impact on the lives of members of the public. As such, they require the highest ethical and operational standards. That is why we have tabled new clause 27 to ensure that all long-term undercover operations would be signed off by a relevant independent body, to ensure that this important tool is used proportionately, sensitively and only when necessary, and with clear and improved accountability arrangements. That type of sign-off for police operations has precedent. If the police or security services want to break in and bug a room or intercept a phone call, they have to have a justification in the interests of national security&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.628.1/1">Having taken several interventions yesterday, I say with great regret that, because of the time and because other issues are down for debate, I will not take interventions. That will not be a precedent for the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/2">On other kinds of police operation a sign-off is necessary, but the oversight of the existing arrangements in this regard is inadequate. That cannot be right, so our new clause would help to ensure that unacceptable operations such as the alleged smear campaign against the Lawrence family cannot take place and that each operation undertaken is accountable, justifiable and in the wider public interest.</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/3">Let me now deal with new clause 26. Last year alone, 4% of retail staff were attacked at work and 34% were threatened with violence. Our new clause seeks to address a discrepancy in sentencing policy regarding people who suffer serious assaults during the course of their daily employment. At present, sentencing guidelines are explicit that an aggravating factor in determining a sentence for common assault on a public-facing worker should be whether the offence was committed against an individual working in the public sector or providing a service to the public. Whereas assaulting a police constable while they are discharging their duty is a separate offence that carries an additional sentence, an attack on those in public sector employment, such as nurses, is an aggravated offence. However, that consideration</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/4">does not apply in respect of the millions of hard-working people in our shops, petrol stations and restaurants. That leaves the judge to decide under which of the three categories of harm and culpability, the 19 aggravating factors and the 11 factors reducing the seriousness, assaulting a staff member falls. That is why there is real concern, particularly but not exclusively in the retail sector, about the level of attacks on employees and the sentencing guidelines&#8212;or lack thereof. This is a real problem, brought to the public attention not only by unions such as the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers but by the British Retail Consortium, who have come together to advance the &#8220;Freedom from Fear&#8221; campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/5">Although some progress has been made&#8212;of that there is no doubt&#8212;there remains an unacceptable level of assaults against public-facing workers, with 30,000 attacks on shop staff reported last year. Indeed, the British Retail Consortium estimates that the figure could be as high as 35,000. That does not include those that were not reported. Our proposed new clause simply makes it clear that attacking an individual in the course of their employment should be considered an aggravating factor, whether they work in the public or the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/6">It cannot be right that we have an unacceptable level of assaults on staff, some of which are very serious with lasting traumatic effects. That includes a machete raid on a corner shop in which an individual suffered severe lacerations. Only &#163;150 was stolen, but the impact on the individual has been profound and lasting. The evidence from many of the attacks shows that they impact on the mental and physical well-being of the staff who were trying to do their jobs, and that should not be underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/7">Of course it is right that we should give particular consideration to police officers and nurses and doctors in hospitals, but our new clause says that if someone is working in a betting shop, an off-licence or a supermarket, or on a bus run by a private company, their job is also important. They serve the public, even if they are not public servants. Does the Minister not agree that they should be afforded the same support and protection in the workplace? We believe that the time has come to send an unmistakable message that all citizens are entitled not just to dignity at work but to security at work.</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/8">We hope that the Minister will respond positively to new clause 27 and that further consideration will be given to the idea in the other place. Our intention on new clause 26, if the Minister does not agree to it, is to press it to a vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/9">New clause 16 is about the control of new psychoactive substances or legal highs. The problem with legal highs is exactly that&#8212;they are legal, so people do not see them as dangerous or feel the need to be careful about them or about the regulation around them. One such case involved Maryon Stewart, whose child tragically died and who established the Angelus Foundation. We need to ensure that anyone who uses a legal high knows the effect and that there is proper regulation to ensure that we do not have legal highs that lead to a high number of deaths. There were 29 such deaths in 2011 and 52 in 2012. All the indications suggest that that figure is growing.</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/10">We have proposed the new clause because the number of new psychoactive substances is on the rise. It is estimated that more than 500,000 people, predominantly</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/11">young people, use them and there is profoundly worrying research, including from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, on their impact.</p>
	<p pid="b.628.1/12">Our country is almost at the top of the league in the European Union and it is the second biggest market in the world, not just because of the online operators but because of the hundreds of high-street legal high sellers.</p>

It is absolutely clear, however, that the Government need to go further. Their approach should be flexible but determined, with the necessary powers to take us beyond the existing arrangements, under which only a handful of legal highs are scrutinised every year. This is a marketplace where new products constantly evolve, many of which put those who use them seriously at risk, and in the future we should tackle the problem, banning the use of such products, while, where appropriate, putting out of business those who promote and sell them. I hope that the Government will respond positively to this powerful case, not least because it is being put by many of those whose sons and daughters have died as a consequence of using substances that they never believed for one moment would put their lives at risk.</p>

	<p pid="b.630.2/1">I know that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40578" name="Ann Coffey">the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey)</phrase> and other hon. Members wish to speak, so I shall be as quick as I can.</p>
	<p pid="b.630.2/2">I declare an interest as a special constable with the British Transport police, which is why I wanted to speak. My speech can be short, because I agree with most of what <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40081" name="Jack Dromey">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey)</phrase> said. I particularly support new clause 26 on public-facing workers. I have little need to add anything. The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right in everything he said. In fact, only yesterday, I dealt with a lady, a retail worker, who had been spat at at close range. Obviously, I meet many rail staff who&#8212;the hon. Gentleman did not mention this&#8212;are the victims of daily verbal and physical abuse. We have already heard about nurses, too. I absolutely agree with the new clause and told my Whips that I would support it and vote for it, if it came to a vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.630.2/3">I am saddened that I am unable to do so, however, because of new clause 34, about which the hon. Member for Stockport will speak in a minute. I ask her to think very carefully about that, because the clause would reverse some of the good work that would be done by new clause 26. It would take away some of the rights that police constables, who are, after all, public sector, public-facing workers, should have. They should have the same rights as nurses, rail staff, bus drivers and the rest. That is important because police officers are often called to domestic dwelling houses late at night, in cases where drugs and drink can be involved, and they will suffer horrendous verbal abuse and, sometimes, threats of physical abuse. I do not think that police officers</p>
	<p pid="b.630.2/4">should have to put up with that any more than social workers or anyone else who goes into a private dwelling house.</p>
	<p pid="b.630.2/5">New clause 34 might also have unintended consequences. I am not trying to suggest that anyone is doing anything wrong, but sometimes neighbours might ring to allege that domestic violence is taking place and, when the police officer arrives, they might find one angry male&#8212;I am sorry if that is a stereotype, but it is often the case&#8212;under the influence of drink and shouting, swearing and so on. If neither of the people in that house is able to make an accusation, the fact that one person is drunk and shouting might be enough to allow a police officer to remove them from the premises by arresting them under the Public Order Act 1986. That is not something that police officers do lightly because they know that any arrest needs to be proportionate and that they will have to take somebody in front of a custody officer, who will not take kindly to arrests made without due cause. I ask the hon. Lady to think very carefully about her new clause.</p>
	<p pid="b.630.2/6">If the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington wishes to propose his new clause on some other occasion or to table an early-day motion, I will fully support him. I offer him my public support and I will vote for such protection for public sector workers. I would not do so, however, at the expense of police officers, who are also public sector workers like all the others.</p>

	<p pid="b.631.0/1">I want to say a few words on new clause 34. I thank <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40407" name="David Davies">the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies)</phrase> for giving me his views on it, but I think there might have been a misunderstanding.</p>
	<p pid="b.631.0/2">The new clause would change the law to make the use of racist or other abusive language in a dwelling house an offence when it was directed at a policeman. I was recently contacted by a serving police officer from my constituency who was present when a colleague from the Greater Manchester police was called a &#8220;nigger&#8221; in a private house. Under section 4A of the Public Order Act 1986, no offence is committed if the &#8220;harassment, alarm or distress&#8221; takes place inside a dwelling house&#8212;that is, somebody&#8217;s house or flat. I was surprised by that because, like many people, I was under the impression that racist abuse was an offence wherever it was committed. However, this is not the case. I was shocked to hear that somebody could not be charged with the offence because it took place in a dwelling against a police officer pursuing his duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.631.0/3">My amendment would make it an offence to use racist or other abusive language against a police constable who was present in a dwelling in the execution of his duty. The police officer from my constituency described attending a property where two men were aggressively arguing. One was very drunk and called one of the police officers a nigger. The officer described seeing her colleague abused and she told me, &#8220;I was quite horrified he had to endure this kind of abuse. I felt very frustrated and helpless that we could not charge the offender with any offence.&#8221; I am sure that this is by no means an isolated case and I suspect that other professionals such as social workers and health visitors have also been subject to racist abuse when visiting a person at their home address. It does not seem right to me or, I suspect, to the public that if the police officer had been called a</p>
	<p pid="b.631.0/4">nigger in the street, an offence would have been committed, but none was committed because it happened inside a house. I hope the Minister will feel able to consider the amendment that I propose.</p>

	<p pid="b.632.0/1">I shall be very brief as we are short of time, and I know that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase> also hopes to catch your eye, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.632.0/2">I draw the attention of the House and those watching our proceedings to amendments 179, 178, 180, 181 and 183. I do that not just in my own name, but on behalf of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which examined the issue as part of its consideration of the Bill. The Joint Committee is disappointed that the Government have not yet published in full their responses to their consultation on schedule 7. These are controversial issues. Of course, we need anti-terrorist legislation and there is always a balance to be worked out between the civil liberty of the subject and the powers of the authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.632.0/3">We believe, however, that it is very important that legislation distinguishes between the conventional powers to stop, to search, and to question, which can be exercised without reasonable suspicion, and more intrusive powers, such as those of detaining and taking biometric samples, for which the Committee believes the Government have not yet made a persuasive case. The Joint Committee recommends introducing a reasonable suspicion requirement for the more intrusive powers under schedule 7. I know that some argue that schedule 7 should go altogether. That is not the position of the Joint Committee nor, coincidentally, is it the position of my party, which debated this at our conference in Glasgow a few weeks ago and took a view that there should be amendment broadly along the lines set out by the Joint Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.632.0/4">The issue came to prominence, as the House will remember, in August, when Mr David Miranda was stopped at Heathrow when coming into this country on his way back home to Brazil and was detained for nine hours under the anti-terror laws. There were protests by the Brazilian Government and widespread concern about whether the powers were used extensively. We hope we can persuade the Government to take the position of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, but we will not seek to divide the House this afternoon, hoping there might be a chance not just for my hon. Friend, but even for the Minister to respond to our concerns.</p>

	<p pid="b.632.1/1">I shall do my best to be brief to allow the Minister time to respond to the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/2">I welcome Government new clause 11. It is right to extend powers to PCSOs, allowing them to issue fixed penalty notices to cyclists riding without lights. I am a huge champion of cycling. I was delighted when the House passed a motion to get Britain cycling. One of the banes of my life in that context is cyclists who do not obey the rules of the road. Anything that we can do to get people to cycle safely and legally will make it easier for those of us who want to extend facilities for cyclists. There are sensible ways forward. In Cambridge we have been using a &#8220;lights instead of tickets&#8221; campaign to make sure that people get their lights. I welcome the new clause as a sensible step forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/3">I shall spend most of my time talking about schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000, to which I have tabled a series of amendments. There has been particular controversy</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/4">recently, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40072" name="Simon Hughes">the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)</phrase> mentioned, because of the detention of David Miranda, the partner of</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/5" class="italic">The</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/6" class="italic">Guardian</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/7">journalist working on the Edward Snowden leaks. This has led to the Independent Police Complaints Commission taking the Met to the High Court over failure to address complaints and how schedule 7 is used. This is a very broadly written power. It should not be a surprise that it has expanded from its original use in Northern Ireland in the 1970s to become worse and worse as illiberal Governments have made it even heavier.</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/8">It seems to me that it is not right for people who &#8220;look like terrorists&#8221; to be detained. That is exactly what happens under schedule 7. StopWatch has done a huge amount of work on this. Last year there were 64,000 schedule 7 stops&#8212;a huge number. Twenty-seven per cent. of those stopped for under an hour were Asian, much more than their proportion in the community, and 77% of those stopped for more than an hour were from ethnic minority populations. We should not consider that acceptable. StopWatch cites some chilling quotes from one man Glasgow who said that</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/9">&#8220;the first thing you ask your friend is . . . not how was the holiday, it&#8217;s did you get stopped and what did they ask you?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/10">If we are setting up a power that creates huge concern in the Muslim and ethnic minority populations, that will separate people from the bulk of our country and is deeply alarming. The Equality and Human Rights Commission and David Anderson QC have also commented on how damaging that is.</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/11">This is a matter that Liberal Democrats have been concerned about for a long time. It is not just about David Miranda, who has the support of <i>The Guardian</i>. It is also about people who are detained routinely. That is why my party has debated this and why I tabled a range of proposals. There are many concerns about schedule 7. One option would be to get rid of it. There are alternative powers in section 47A. I hope the Minister will comment on what that is. There are other options that we have looked at. I would like to see us committed to David Anderson QC&#8217;s proposals to limit the scope of schedule 7. The Government should introduce provisions to that effect in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/12">I have also proposed implementing proposals that my party made at our conference. They include getting rid of the principle that authorities can stop people without any suspicion at all, restoring the right to silence for those who are detained, and questioning to be recorded from start to finish. Restoring confidence and the basic principles of the rule of law to that process and making sure that data collected are not used inappropriately should be important in the case of David Miranda. I also propose a statutory principle of annual review and a sunset clause. The Government should look at these proposals and I hope they will take advantage of the process to make sure that that happens. I am glad that that is supported by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="b.632.1/13">I would love to deal with the proposals made by the Opposition and their proposals to ban synthetic caffeine, but in the interests of time I will allow the Minister to respond.</p>

	<p pid="b.633.0/1">I am grateful. I shall be brief.</p>
	<p pid="b.633.0/2">On new clause 26, as I said in Committee, I entirely agree with the sentiments behind the clause. The work of a great number of people, whether within the public or the private sector, brings them into face-to-face contact with members of the public, and we know that some of these people suffer violence in the course of their jobs. It is essential that we are satisfied that the law adequately addresses this issue. However, I do not think the new clause is necessary to achieve that. There is already a range of offences that have general application and that criminalise violent behaviour and they would already apply in the context envisaged by the clause. Sentencing guidelines specify that where an assault is committed against someone providing a service to the public, whether in the public or private sector, this is an aggravating factor and so could well result in a higher sentence within the current maximum. So I do not think the clause is necessary, although as I said, I sympathise with the sentiment behind it.</p>
	<p pid="b.633.0/3">New clause 27 seeks to introduce a system of independent authorisation for undercover policing operations. I announced to the Home Affairs Committee in June our intention to legislate to enhance oversight of undercover law enforcement officer deployments. This can be done through secondary legislation and I will lay the appropriate order before the House shortly.</p>
	<p pid="b.633.0/4">The changes will mean that law enforcement agencies will need to notify the Surveillance Commissioners, all retired senior judges, at the outset of undercover operations and get their prior approval for every deployment that lasts longer than 12 months. In addition, I am increasing the rank of the authorising officer. Deployments of undercover law enforcement officers will be authorised at assistant chief constable level or equivalent. Deployments lasting longer than 12 months will be authorised by a chief constable or equivalent. The rank of an authorising officer for emergency deployments will increase from inspector to superintendent level or equivalent. These changes will promote the highest standards of professionalism and excellence in this most sensitive area of policing and therefore achieve the aims of new clause 28. I hope they will be welcomed by the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.633.0/5">On schedule 7, there is clearly debate on whether this requires further modification along the lines proposed in some of the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase> and others. For the purposes of the debate today, I put it to my hon. Friend and to the Chair of the Joint Committee that it is premature to consider making such changes because the Independent Reviewer of Terrorism Legislation, David Anderson QC, has decided to investigate and report on the exercise of these powers in the case of David Miranda. The Government, sensibly, will want to examine carefully any recommendations he makes in his report, and I am sure that the Joint Committee on Human Rights and my right hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark will want to do likewise. It would be wrong to pre-empt that report or commit now to implementing its recommendations. It is for the independent reviewer to make recommendations, but it is for the Government and Parliament to decide what legislative changes should flow from them.</p>

	<p pid="b.660.0/1">It is a pleasure to speak in this debate and to move this new clause, which stands in the names of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40372" name="Luciana Berger">the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger)</phrase> and my right hon.

	<p pid="b.660.0/2">Dangerous dogs, or, perhaps more accurately, irresponsible dog owners, are a serious public threat. Not only do we have a duty to act, but there is widespread agreement on what form that action should take. I regret to say that the Government are the only ones standing meekly on the sidelines, refusing to take the necessary action. Having failed to lead from the start with this Bill, the Government refused to act in Committee, despite the support of their own Back Benchers for such action, but I hope, with a new Minister in place, there will be a fresh approach and a chance to move forward and tackle this menace.</p>
	<p pid="b.660.0/3">I want to start by speaking to amendment 141, which was tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the hon. Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase>. I have strong sympathy with the case he is making, and which he made in Committee, for a much stronger punishment for irresponsible dog owners who allow their dogs to maim and kill. We were deeply disappointed, however, that the Government failed to meet their own promise, made in an open Committee, to publish the findings of a consultation on what level of sentencing would be appropriate in such cases before the Bill returned to the Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="b.660.0/4">As it was, the Minister wrote to members of the Committee last Friday, after the tabling deadline. An e-mail was sent at 5.50 in the evening, stating that the Government had not had time to review the consultation responses, and that therefore no Government amendment would be put before the House. It was in good faith that the Opposition did not table an amendment, as we believed his predecessor&#8217;s word that the consultation would result in a Government amendment. Announcing that he would not do anything after the tabling deadline was not a welcome start to the Minister&#8217;s tenure in the Home Office. I hope that we will not see a repeat of those tactics.</p>

	<p pid="b.661.0/1">Does the hon.

	<p pid="b.661.1/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. I have read the comments that he made in Committee and sympathise with his views. I hope to address them further in my comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.661.1/2">The Opposition supported increasing the guideline prison terms for manslaughter under the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 in Committee. We continue to support an increase, although we would prefer to have the consultation response before the House so that an informed decision can be made. Our starting point is that the current maximum sentence of two years&#8217; imprisonment for allowing one&#8217;s dog to kill someone is far too lenient. I hope that the hon. Member for Bedford will accept our support in principle for toughening the sentencing guidelines and work with us in the other place to agree on appropriate sentencing guidelines, informed by the consultation response when the Government get around to publishing it.</p>
	<p pid="b.661.1/3">New clause 3 would introduce dog control notices. I believe that this measure enjoys widespread cross-party support in the House and near-unanimous support from outside organisations with an interest in dangerous dogs and animal welfare. When reading the Committee transcripts, I was struck by the strength of support from Government Back Benchers, in addition to the support from Labour Members. However, that should not be surprising. Taking responsible, tough action to protect people from dangerous dogs and irresponsible dog owners is plain common sense and something that Members on all sides of the House should support.</p>
	<p pid="b.661.1/4">Yesterday, I joined my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" name="Julie Hilling">the Member for Bolton West (Julie Hilling)</phrase> to meet the father of Jade Anderson, who was savaged to death by four dogs when she was just 14 years old. Michael Anderson and his friend Royston had cycled down from Bolton in support of the Justice for Jade campaign. They came to lobby Members of this House because they want dog control notices to be introduced in England and Wales, as they have been in Scotland. To lose a child is bad enough; to live with the knowledge of the appalling circumstances in which they died is almost too much to bear. I can offer Mr Anderson only my support, sympathy and admiration that he is seeking to make something good out of such desperate and tragic circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="b.661.1/5">Sadly, Jade&#8217;s case is not an isolated one. Since 2005, nine children and seven adults have died as a consequence of dog attacks. In the three years to February 2013, 18,000 people were admitted to hospital in England and Wales after dog attacks. That is almost 20 attacks a day that result in someone ending up in hospital. Not only could many of those attacks be prevented by dog control notices, but the cost of those attacks to the NHS, the police and communities is an avoidable drain on already overstretched resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.661.1/6">Dog control notices are not punitive. They provide a menu of options that local authorities and the police can use to act in the interests of their local communities against dangerous dogs and irresponsible owners.</p>

	<p pid="b.662.0/1">I commend my hon. Friend and those who tabled new clause 3, which would improve the Bill. May I also commend to him and other hon. Members new clause 17, which was tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" name="Angela Smith">the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith)</phrase>? It would dovetail nicely with new clause 3 and would allow the notices to be published there and then at the point when they are needed, rather than waiting for an attack to take place.</p>

	<p pid="b.662.1/1">I thank my hon. Friend, who has an abiding interest in this issue, for that most helpful intervention. I will seek to address his point further in my comments.</p>
	<p pid="b.662.1/2">Dog control notices include the following measures: requiring a potentially dangerous dog to be muzzled whenever it is in a public place; requiring it to be kept on a lead in places to which the public have access; neutering male dogs; and requiring dogs and dog owners to attend training classes to bring potentially dangerous animals back under control. A dog control notice would also require the dog to be microchipped and registered, so that any dogs that were found to be in breach could be identified clearly and unambiguously&#8212;something that is absolutely necessary for effective enforcement.</p>

	<p pid="b.662.2/1">May I draw the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s attention to new clause 19, which appears in my name and that of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" name="Anne McIntosh">the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh)</phrase>? It talks about not only the dog owner, but the person who is in control of the dog at the time. I hope that he will recognise that it is important to hold that person responsible.</p>

	<p pid="b.662.3/1">The hon. Gentleman makes a sensible and helpful point. I recognise the sense of what he says.</p>
	<p pid="b.662.3/2">It is disappointing that on Second Reading and in Committee, the Government resisted dog control notices and said that community protection notices would be sufficient. I can only hope that, having read the Committee transcripts, the new Minister will bring fresh eyes to the issue and use fresh ears to listen to the experience of outside organisations, the victims of dog attacks and Members from all parts of the House who want tougher action.</p>
	<p pid="b.662.3/3">The use of community protection notices, as advocated by the Government, is simply not sufficient. They are slow to serve, can be challenged in the courts, causing further delays, and have been described by one outside organisation as a sledgehammer to crack a nut. The Government had a perfect opportunity to show leadership on this issue. They could have led this House and this country to act to protect children and adults alike from further dog attacks. However, the powers in the Bill and the limited changes to which the Government are clinging are not sufficient&#8212;not even close.</p>

	<p pid="b.662.4/1">My hon. Friend is making an excellent case for new clause 3. Does he agree that one of the successes of devolution is that we in Westminster can learn from the experiences of the devolved authorities in various matters and do</p>

	<p pid="b.663.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that helpful reference to the situation in Scotland. Given that the experience of dog control notices in Scotland shows that they work effectively, it is all the more baffling that the Government refuse to support them. I hope that the House can persuade the Minister to change his position.</p>
	<p pid="b.663.0/2">The position for which I am arguing is not just a Labour one. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, which has a coalition majority, considered the Bill and concluded:</p>
	<p pid="b.663.0/3">&#8220;We consider there to be strong evidence that targeted measures would be more effective in tackling dog-related problems than the general powers proposed under the Government&#8217;s anti-social behaviour and crime legislation&#8230;We recommend that the Government reconsider its rejection of our recommendation and legislate to introduce Dog Control Notices to provide law enforcers with tailored powers to tackle aggressive dogs before they injure people and other animals.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.663.1/1">My hon. Friend has eloquently set out the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee&#8217;s response on this serious issue. I do not know whether he saw the Chair of that Committee&#8217;s summary of what was in the report, in which she said that what the Government had brought forward was &#8220;woefully inadequate&#8221;. She said that unless we have a measure that deals effectively with prevention, we will not tackle the problem at its source. Does my hon.

	<p pid="b.663.2/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for putting that sensible view on the record. Of course, I am sympathetic to it. Indeed, I will add another sensible view, that of the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, who said:</p>
	<p pid="b.663.2/2">&#8220;We remain unconvinced that CPNs will fulfil the same purpose as bespoke Dog Control Notices.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.663.2/3">I could go on to read the evidence to the Bill Committee of organisation after organisation: the Kennel Club, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home, police and crime commissioners, the Local Government Association and the Association of Chief Police Officers. Although that would support my argument, I fear that a lengthy recitation would weary the House. However, two further sources of support for dog control notices are worth drawing to the House&#8217;s attention.</p>
	<p pid="b.663.2/4">First, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40159" name="Tracey Crouch">the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch)</phrase> helpfully drew the Bill Committee&#8217;s attention to the fact that before the general election, the Conservative party pledged to give police and councils more power to tackle the problem of dangerous dogs through the introduction of dog control notices. As it happens, the same is true of the Liberal Democrats, who also supported such notices when in opposition. We are used to the policies of one or other Government party being lost in coalition fudges, but I am not aware of a policy supported by both parties being lost in such a way. On this occasion, not only do I agree with Nick, but I am willing to agree with Dave as well. If we all agree, for goodness&#8217; sake let us act and bring in long-overdue</p>
	<p pid="b.663.2/5">and much-needed tough but fair measures to deal with dangerous dogs. Six thousand hospitalisations a year is too many simply to look the other way. I would challenge any Member to sit down with Michael Anderson, Jade&#8217;s father, as I did yesterday, and not conclude that the measures that we suggest must be on the statute book.</p>
	<p pid="b.663.2/6">I commend my hon. Friend the Member for Bolton West, who is in her place, for tabling new clause 6, which is similar to new clause 3 in many ways. It highlights her commitment to bringing her constituency issues to the House in the most powerful way possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.663.2/7">New clauses 17, 29 and 30, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" name="Angela Smith">the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith)</phrase>, were mentioned earlier. They include a number of further sensible and proportionate measures to deal with dangerous dogs, and I am sure that Members of the other place will want to study them carefully in their less time-pressured environment and take up many of them.</p>
	<p pid="b.663.2/8">I must push the Minister to accept new clause 3. To date, the Bill has been a missed opportunity for the Government. The need for tougher action is clear and well evidenced, and the desire to act has been endorsed not just by the parties of government before the last election but by the cross-party Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee and by every major organisation that deals with dangerous dogs, animal welfare and irresponsible owners. The means to act are now before the Minister, and I urge him to take the chance to do so.</p>

	<p pid="b.664.2/1">I rise to speak to new clause 19 and amendments 97 to 99, which I and my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40605" name="Anne McIntosh">the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh)</phrase> tabled. Like <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40696" name="Steve Reed">the hon. Member for Croydon North (Mr Reed)</phrase>, we are keen to ensure that there is provision for written notices so that not only dog owners but those in charge of a dog at any time have control of that animal and prevent it from causing injury or damage to any person or any other animal.</p>
	<p pid="b.664.2/2">Of course, there has to be a balance in the process, and I emphasise the need for home owners to be able to protect their property using a dog. Dogs must be allowed to protect property from burglars or trespassers who may be there to commit a crime. It is important that we get that balance right and that home owners are allowed to protect their property. Dogs must be allowed to defend property and act in a territorial manner, as they are inclined to do, without a home owner having to fear prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="b.664.2/3">I also wish to draw attention to the plight of those who are disabled and have a guide dog or hearing dog. People who are fortunate enough to be able-bodied can only imagine what it must be like for a blind person if</p>
	<p pid="b.664.2/4">their guide dog is attacked in the street. Not only do they lose their means of getting home, but the animal for which they care is disabled or injured, and they are unable to get it the assistance it requires. I hope the Minister will ensure that the Bill protects and provides adequately for people who have a guide dog or hearing dog. For a disabled person to be in those circumstances is absolutely intolerable.</p>
	<p pid="b.664.2/5">Finally, I seek the Minister&#8217;s assurance that he will look long and hard at the new clauses and amendments on written notices, take on board Members&#8217; comments and consider the position.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.665.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" speakername="Angela Smith" colnum="665"  time="015:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew14">
	<p pid="b.665.0/1">We have all heard the tragic tales of those who have been injured or even killed by dogs that are out of control, and the issue is of growing concern to the public. I am therefore glad at least to see that the Government are prepared to do something to tackle the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/2">The cases that have stuck out in the debate that has taken place over the past few years relate to children such as John Paul Massey, from Liverpool, who died three or four years ago; the girl from Chingford who was attacked in the park and nearly lost part of her ear because of an attack by a dog that was running free, unrestrained by its owner; and Jade Anderson, who died recently and about whom we have heard today. There was also the case of Keith Davies, the postman in Cambridgeshire who was attacked in a cul-de-sac by two Rottweilers that had escaped from behind the gates of a private residence, and who nearly lost an arm. It was saved only through the skilful intervention of surgeons. Paul Coleman, the Sheffield postman who got me involved in this campaign, nearly lost his leg as a result of an attack on the street where I used to live by a dog that was roaming free on the public highway.</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/3">All those cases indicate to me that enough is enough. We spend &#163;9.5 million a year on NHS costs alone to deal with the injuries inflicted on human beings by dogs that are out of control, and that is before considering the costs incurred by the police and other bodies in dealing with the issue. Any progress, however slight, is therefore welcome. I particularly welcome the Government&#8217;s decision to extend the law to private property. The onus will now be on owners to exercise responsible control of their dogs at all times, which will be welcomed not just by postal workers but by other delivery workers, health visitors, doctors, party members canvassing at election times and a whole range of other people. That really important safeguard will be more than welcome, because 6,000 postal workers a year alone are injured as a result of attacks on private property.</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/4">I believe that a strengthening of the defence must be built into the proposed legislation. The Bill currently includes the defence of general household protection, but amendment 142 would strengthen the defences given to householders who do their utmost to ensure they keep their dogs under reasonable control. It is my contention, and that of bodies such as the RSPCA, that the current defence does not do enough to protect householders who do their best to keep their dogs under control at all times. We can never legislate for all possibilities, and it is important that we include the best possible defences in the Bill to ensure that householders do not, for example, adopt the habit of keeping dogs imprisoned in the house for most of the day because they have</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/5">visitors. That would be unreasonable, but the Bill as currently drafted could make dog owners feel vulnerable to the proposed legislation, and therefore adopt those unfortunate welfare standards. Amendment 142 is reasonable and I hope the Minister will take it seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/6">My general point about the content of the Bill is that we need more than currently exists. What we do have is not necessarily best designed and in many ways is inadequate for encouraging responsible dog ownership and improving the welfare of dogs more generally. We need not only consolidation of the legislation but a comprehensive look at what measures we need for dog control. That position is supported by a grand coalition of charities and trade unions, including the RSPCA, the Dogs Trust, the Blue Cross, and Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. The Dogs Trust pointed out that 12 pieces of legislation in statute deal with dog control, but little emphasis is placed on the prevention of attacks and there is little focus on responsible dog ownership.</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/7">We need legislation that deals with dog ownership in the broadest possible sense, which is why I am working with animal welfare charities on a strategy to take a long-term look at what needs to be done, and at how charities work together to improve welfare standards and responsible dog ownership. Once finalised, legislation will inevitably be part of that strategy, focusing not only on dog control by the dog owner but on the breeding and sale of dogs, and the responsibility of all involved in dog welfare, including dog owners.</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/8">The Bill does not tackle that issue holistically or comprehensively, and along with animal welfare charities I remain disappointed that we have not had a dedicated Bill to update the legislation. Community protection notices are a blunt and unwieldy measure, not suited to the task of tackling irresponsible dog ownership. As indicated by the changes in new clause 17, the Bill contains no power to issue notices instantly so as to get on top of a dog that is potentially dangerous or out of control as soon as the situation occurs. In some cases, inevitably, the authorities will wait until an attack has been committed before issuing a notice, because they will not feel they should intervene and go through the unwieldy procedure to get a written notice before they can make that move. I do not believe that the Bill tackles those issues. New clause 3, tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40696" name="Steve Reed">the Member for Croydon North (Mr Reed)</phrase>, contains the important requirement that an owner whose dog is potentially out of control should be made to engage in training and behaviour courses related to their ownership of the dog, and in that sense the new clause is helpful.</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/9">New clause 17 provides for a bespoke community protection notice modelled on the dog control notices recommended by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. Guidance has already been issued on community protection notices and the measures in the Bill, but so far that guidance is long and difficult to interpret, and much of the support offered is found in the annexes to the guidance, not the guidance itself. As far as animal welfare charities are concerned, there will be an issue about the interpretation of that guidance, and a risk that animal welfare standards will be compromised as a result of the way it has been drafted. The guidance has not been produced properly in consultation with animal welfare charities.</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/10">Finally&#8212;you have been patient, Mr Deputy Speaker&#8212;I will refer quickly to the new clauses that relate to section 1 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. Clearly, section 1 on breed-specific legislation is not working. In a consultation run by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on that Act and the measures before us today, 71% of those consulted thought that the breed-specific section of that Act should be repealed because it is not working. It costs a tremendous amount of money to kennel dogs seized under section 1 of the Act, with an annual cost over the past three financial years of &#163;2.6 million for the Metropolitan police alone.</p>
	<p pid="b.665.0/11">The new clauses relate to the need to ensure that a time limit is imposed on the courts regarding how long a banned-breed dog can be held before the issue of whether it should be exempt from the legislation is dealt with, to ensure that animal welfare standards are not compromised. That is critical. There should also be the power to rehome dogs that are fit for exemption but have nowhere to go. The only other choice available to animal welfare charities at the moment is euthanasia, which is not good enough. It is the deed not the breed, and I look forward to hearing the Minister&#8217;s comments on that important issue, which I know the Metropolitan police, as well as animal charities such as the RSPCA, are keen to see dealt with.</p>

	<p pid="b.667.2/1">I rise to address amendment 133 tabled in my name, which looks specifically at extending the Bill to include protected animals. I tabled a similar amendment&#8212;slightly differently worded&#8212;in Committee, and it has been redrafted by animal welfare charities for consideration today. The amendment is intended to be limited in scope, and would not capture a genuine, accidental attack by a dog on a protected animal&#8212;that was one concern raised in Committee. For example, some dogs chase cats or other small animals, and that would not be caught by the amendment, which refers specifically to attacks.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.2/2">From previous discussions in Committee we know there has been an increase in attacks on protected animals. Charities, law enforcement agencies and the general public are concerned about the increase, yet we do not have a public record of the number of attacks and must rely on press reports. We know that there have been 66 reports of attacks&#8212;mostly fatal&#8212;on cats, including one last week, when the death of Caspar, which was devastating for the family involved, was reported in the <i>Bolton News</i>.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.2/3">The problem is genuine for people who love their pets&#8212;it is incredibly important to them. My proposal is designed to deal not only with dog-chasing-cat events; attacks are often aggravated. The argument in Committee was that the current legislation deals with the problem, but some animal welfare charities beg to differ. For example, it is true that the RSPCA has used section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006 on occasion to prosecute</p>
	<p pid="b.667.2/4">following dog attacks on other animals, but there is often incitement by the animal&#8217;s keeper or a history of other attacks. It can therefore be difficult to obtain information or prove a case, which means that section 4 is not a straightforward mechanism for prosecution.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.2/5">We discussed the Dogs Act 1871 in Committee. It is true that the Act can be used for attacks on protected animals, but it is limited in scope and application in the case of one-off incidents. The current legislation is not conducive to early intervention or a preventive approach, or to dealing with less severe problems. We therefore need to look at the Act again.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.2/6">There has been an increase in the number of attacks on horses, which I mentioned in Committee on behalf of the British Horse Society. The Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953 is applicable, but, under that Act, the attack must take place on agricultural land for an offence to be committed. Horses on bridleways are therefore not included. It is also not clear whether the Act is applicable when attacks take place on private property&#8212;it depends whether land is considered grazing land.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.2/7">Animal welfare charities do not believe that the current legislation is sufficient, which is why I have felt compelled to table amendment 133 again on Report. I believe that that will send a strong message to the other place that many people&#8212;not just scrutinisers of legislation, but those who love their companion animals&#8212;are concerned.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.2/8">Briefly, on dog control notices and community protection notices, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40696" name="Steve Reed">the hon. Member for Croydon North (Mr Reed)</phrase> was right to indicate that I said in Committee that there was a manifesto commitment. I stand by that commitment, and the Government have gone a long way to address the problems with dog control notices. Tellingly, organisations such as the Dogs Trust have made it clear that they are assured that the principle of DCNs could be applied within a CPN. However, the Dogs Trust has said&#8212;I am sympathetic to this&#8212;that the draft guidance on CPN enforcement is vague, particularly with regard to application. The Minister therefore needs to reassure the House, the charities that have been in touch with hon. Members on DCNs, and trade unions such as the Communication Workers Union, which provided an excellent briefing in advance of the debate, that CPNs will do as much if not more than DCNs. It is important that we send a clear message that we take the problem seriously.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.2/9">Finally, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> is not in his place to speak to the amendments he has tabled, but they are interesting and worthy of consideration, specifically on exemptions&#8212;for example, should a person who is the victim of an attack and whose dog then attacks the other person be liable? I am not suggesting that the Minister should accept all the exemptions proposed by my hon. Friend, but I urge him to consider them in a meaningful way.</p>
	<p pid="b.667.2/10">This is an incredibly important issue and one that drives a great deal of emotion and passion, not only among victims of attacks but among those who care very much about their companion animals. The fact is that the dangerous dogs and animal welfare legislation is incredibly complex. I am not convinced that the Bill simplifies it in any way, shape or form, but I hope the Minister acts on the concerns with regard to protected animals.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.669.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40578" speakername="Ann Coffey" colnum="669"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew18">
	<p pid="b.669.0/1">I shall speak to new clause 18, which is in my name and those of my hon. Friends. Rightly, there is a lot of concern about serious injury and death caused by aggressive dogs, and I support the measures proposed by my hon. Friends to tighten the current criminal law and introduce stricter penalties.</p>
	<p pid="b.669.0/2">New clause 18 deals with a different situation&#8212;it is a simple preventive measure to stop injuries to many people who, every year, post millions of bits of paper through letterboxes. It is not unknown for dogs to regard fingers put through letterboxes as curiosities and fair game for fastening their teeth on. Some dogs are aggressive, but others might simply believe they are being playful. The thought of a dog hurtling itself at a letterbox might conjure up visions of an hilarious scene from a sitcom, but for the real-life recipient, it can be traumatic and painful. People can sustain injuries ranging from bite marks and minor bruising to fingers or nerves being severed, causing long-term injury. Some years ago, I had to take my constituency assistant to accident and emergency for a serious injury to her hand sustained while leafleting.</p>
	<p pid="b.669.0/3">The amendment requires householders who keep a dog in their house to put up a wire mesh guard around their letterbox where there is a reasonable probability that, either through aggression or playfulness, it could go for somebody&#8217;s hand. I am not saying that every dog owner must rush out and buy a wire guard&#8212;if they have a good dog there is no need to worry. However, if there is a chance that their dog might jump up and, for whatever reason, bite someone through the letterbox, it would be up to them to take responsibility to prevent accidents and put in a simple wire guard.</p>

	<p pid="b.669.1/1">I strongly support what my hon. Friend is saying. While delivering leaflets during the previous general election campaign, I was bitten by a dog. It took an hour out of my life to have a tetanus injection at the hospital.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.669.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40578" speakername="Ann Coffey" colnum="669"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew20">
	<p pid="b.669.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I am sure his experience is shared by a lot of hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.669.2/2">If dog owners fail to comply with the requirement and there is an incident, the person bitten would be entitled to take a civil court action against them. By this simple measure, I believe that many injuries could be averted every year, and it has the added advantage of protecting householders from the hostility generated if their dog bites someone, particularly if that happens to be a child.</p>
	<p pid="b.669.2/3">I understand that there may not be much public sympathy for politicians who get bitten by dogs, but this is not simply a problem for politicians. Many people push leaflets and letters through doors, including: postmen and women; newspaper boys and girls; people starting up new businesses or advertising pizza and other fast food services; neighbours posting Christmas and birthday cards; and people posting leaflets advertising community events.</p>
	<p pid="b.669.2/4">I support the other amendments that have been tabled that aim to change criminal law, to make owners manage their dogs better and to put stricter penalties in place. However, my amendment is designed with safety, not the criminal law, in mind and I hope the Government</p>
	<p pid="b.669.2/5">will feel able to accept it. If they do not, I hope they will include the proposal in any future consultation.</p>

	<p pid="b.670.0/1">I rise to speak to amendments 140 and 141 in my name, which would increase the maximum sentence to 14 years for owners of an out-of-control dog that kills or injures a person or assistance dog. I am happy that the Government responded to the requests of the Committee and conducted a consultation over the summer. However, I am disappointed that the results are not available.</p>
	<p pid="b.670.0/2">People have the right to see their representatives debate fully and vote on what sentences they feel are appropriate to be imposed on the owners of out-of-control dogs. Those people include the constituents of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" name="Julie Hilling">the hon. Member for Bolton West (Julie Hilling)</phrase>, who has been an outstanding campaigner on behalf of her constituents and the victims of out-of-control dogs across the country. They include the families who have lost loved ones over the years, as hon. Members have mentioned in their speeches, and the 13-year-old boy who was attacked in Bradford a couple of months ago. As reported by the <i>Daily Mail</i>, he suffered a 10-minute attack which ended with the young boy saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to die, I&#8217;m going to die.&#8221; These people have the right to see us debate how we intend to increase sentences.</p>
	<p pid="b.670.0/3">The Communication Workers Union has a lot on its plate these days, but like any good union it is thinking first and foremost about the safety and well-being of its members. Five thousand postal workers are attacked each year by dogs. They have the right to have the House debate the right sentence. It is important for the Minister to understand that the CWU supports a 14-year sentence for the killing of a person by an out-of-control dog. The police also have a right to see us debate and vote on this issue today. In their evidence to the Committee, they raised the total and utter inadequacy of the current legislation in dealing with the important and increasing problem of attacks by out-of-control dogs. I will listen carefully to the Minister&#8217;s comments. I do not want to hear any flim-flam from him about how he is not sure where this is going and how we should just trust the Government to get it right.</p>

	<p pid="b.670.2/2">I believe that 14 years is the right maximum penalty. I am grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40436" name="Stephen Barclay">the Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay)</phrase> and my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40535" name="Stephen Phillips">the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Stephen Phillips)</phrase> for saying that, in many ways, it is equivalent to the maximum penalty imposed for dangerous driving. I believe that 14 years would send a strong message that owners must now take responsibility, and not just assume that it lies with the dog, and to judges, who today, even with the inadequate maximum penalty available, are not handing out very significant sentences when they should.</p>
	<p pid="b.670.2/3">I want us to provide reassurance that this would be a maximum penalty, not a mandatory penalty, and that we are not asking people to lock up their dogs, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" name="Angela Smith">the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith)</phrase> mentioned; we have to get the balance right. I will listen to the Minister, who is casting a fresh set of</p>
	<p pid="b.670.2/4">eyes on this, but let us not forget that at the moment the dog gets a death penalty, but the owner walks away pretty much scot-free. That is not responsible. The Government need to be responsible today and say what they intend to do.</p>

	<p pid="b.671.0/1">I want to speak specifically to new clause 6, other new clauses in my name and some of the amendments.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/2">The House will be aware of the tragedy that occurred in my constituency on <phrase class="date" code="2013-03-26">26 March</phrase>, when 14-year-old Jade Lomas-Anderson was killed by four out-of-control dogs in the house of a friend where she was staying overnight. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40696" name="Steve Reed">the Member for Croydon North (Mr Reed)</phrase> has paid tribute to Jade&#8217;s dad and his friend Royston Brett, who cycled from Atherton to Westminster over the weekend to add their voice to those calling for the legislation to be strengthened in this area.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/3">By all accounts, Jade was a smashing girl, full of life, kind to everyone and a good friend to many. When her parents were asked what Jade would have thought about their campaign for justice, they answered that she would have been the first to campaign, as she was such a caring girl. Her life was cut tragically short, but because of shortcomings in current legislation, no one can be held accountable. The tragedy has had a profound effect, not only on Jade&#8217;s mum and dad, Shirley and Michael, and her immediate family, but on the whole community of Atherton.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/4">Jade&#8217;s parents have bravely led a campaign supported by the community and by Wigan council to ensure that no other family suffers like they have. As Michael says, this is a problem of epidemic proportions. According to the People&#8217;s Dispensary for Sick Animals, 1 million dogs have displayed dangerous behaviour towards people and animals in the past year. About 250,000 attacks are made by dogs each year and 12 postal workers will have been attacked by dogs today. The cost to the NHS and taxpayers is about &#163;9.5 million. According to my figures, more than 6,000 people are hospitalised each year, many of whom will have received life-changing injuries, although my hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North said the number was higher. There have been 16 deaths since 2005 and I cannot even say that Jade was the last person to die, because in May 79-year-old Clifford Clarke was killed in Liverpool. In the area around Hag Fold, where Jade was killed, I know of three serious attacks since March. It is endless.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/5">I am pleased that the Government are taking the issue seriously and that people could now be prosecuted for attacks on private property, and I sincerely hope that they will bring forward proposals to increase the penalties when the Bill goes to the other place, in the way that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the hon. Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> just described. I still believe, however, that they are missing a trick by ignoring the call from all the dog charities, the CWU, vets, nurses and the police to introduce straightforward legislation on dog control notices. I am sure that they believe their proposals will tackle this issue, but when all the dog charities and other vested interests are telling them they have got it wrong, they should listen. Fears that the Government&#8217;s proposals are too bureaucratic; that there would have to be more than one incident; that they would not apply if the dog</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/6">had already been brought under control; and that they would not tackle the problem of dogs first becoming dangerously out of control must be taken seriously and be addressed either today or when the Bill goes to the other place. I hope that the Government see sense today and accept new clause 3.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/7">Let me move on to new clause 6. I believe that the issue of having too many dogs in a household should be tackled as part of dog control notices. I wish I could talk in detail about the dogs that killed Jade, but unfortunately I cannot because the dogs&#8217; owner still awaits sentence on dog cruelty charges. This demonstrates well how dog welfare and community safety are closely linked. For that reason, I will have to speak in the abstract.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/8">First, it is well documented that dogs will act in packs and that unless they are well trained, well socialised and kept under control, they will act together to the detriment of the community.</p>
	<p pid="b.671.0/9">Far too many people do not think through what sort of dog they should have in their household. Are there children? Do they have time to exercise the dogs? How much room do they have? Can they afford to keep and feed the dogs and get them veterinary treatment? Should they get small or big dogs? These questions are not even considered by far too many people when they purchase their puppy. Clearly, then, we need better education. What happens when people make the wrong choice? I believe, as do Jade&#8217;s parents, that there should be the ability to take quick and immediate action to instruct an owner to reduce the number of dogs they have. The number of dogs people have is not a problem only for community safety.</p>

	<p pid="b.672.0/1">What the hon. Lady says about the number of animals sometimes kept in the home is extremely important. On a lot of estates, it is the number of animals that often leads to a lack of control. Does she agree that one of the most important ways of trying to tackle the problem is to get local authorities to engage with housing tenancies and use the management of those tenancies to control the number of dogs in houses and perhaps to say that the top of a tall building, for example, is entirely unsuitable for keeping pets?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.672.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" speakername="Julie Hilling" colnum="672"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew26">
	<p pid="b.672.1/1">I want to say more about that. I agree with the hon. Lady, but the issue does not apply only to social housing, which is why we need legislative change so that the problem of people having too many dogs can be tackled wherever somebody lives. She is right that we need to do more for people in social housing and other rented properties.</p>
	<p pid="b.672.1/2">The number of dogs creates a problem not just in relation to community safety. A recent event was organised on Hag Fold estate by Wigan council to micro-chip dogs and promote responsible ownership as part of the Jade campaign. Two volunteers, Councillor Karen Aldred and the wonderful local resident Sandi Lucas, went knocking on doors to try to find dog owners to encourage them to attend the event. When they knocked on one door, they were told, &#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t got any dogs, but go over there because the owner has loads of dogs and is creating mayhem in the community&#8221;. That owner had seven dogs in a small house, creating noise, unpleasant</p>
	<p pid="b.672.1/3">smells and making life a misery for the neighbours. I am working with Wigan and Leigh Housing on tenancy clauses for dog ownership, but as I said, the issue is not confined to social housing; we need simple remedies for all.</p>
	<p pid="b.672.1/4">The new clause does not specify how many dogs should be in a household because I am not trying to restrict the responsible ownership of dogs. Frankly, if someone lives on a country estate with vast grounds, they can have as many dogs as they want, as long as they do not cause danger or disturbance to anyone else. I hope that the Government will listen to calls from communities to give them the powers they need for people to live peaceful and safe lives.</p>
	<p pid="b.672.1/5">Let me touch briefly on the issue of breeding dogs. We know that a strong contributory factor to dogs becoming out of control is how they are socialised in the first few weeks of their lives&#8212;whether, for example, they are taken away from their mother too soon or are appropriately socialised with other dogs and people or are sold to people who know how to train and look after them. This may be an issue for the urgently needed dog welfare and control Act, which I shall continue to press the Government to introduce because, whatever the results of these provisions, we still need holistic legislation to deal with those issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.672.1/6">Finally, I want to press the Government to extend the legislation to cover attacks on all protected animals. Attacking other animals is a sign that dogs are becoming dangerously out of control and therefore a threat to people. Why should a responsible pet owner have to face the trauma of an attack and the related veterinary expenses and heartache? Many owners are actually injured while trying to protect their beloved pets, such as the woman in Atherton who, just two weeks ago, lost part of her finger when she picked up her dog to protect it from a ferocious dog.</p>
	<p pid="b.672.1/7">There is much in the Bill to be welcomed, but it does not go far enough. I ask the Government to look again and to support our new clauses and amendments to strengthen the Bill. Jade, her parents and all the other victims of dog attacks deserve no less.</p>

	<p pid="b.673.0/1">It is an honour to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" name="Julie Hilling">the hon. Member for Bolton West (Julie Hilling)</phrase>. I am sure that she spoke for the whole House in relation to the case of poor Jade Anderson. Sadly, that is just the latest and most tragic example of what the hon. Lady rightly described as an epidemic of dog attacks which are hospitalising thousands, and injuring thousands of postal workers and others. I am afraid that there have been many distressing cases in my own constituency, which led me to become involved in what has been quite a long campaign. I pay tribute to, in particular, the hon. Members for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith) and for Ealing Central and Acton (Angie Bray), both of whom have campaigned very persistently.</p>
	<p pid="b.673.0/2">For many years it seemed as if the Government were not budging at all on the issue, so it is enormously welcome that we are considering it in the context of this Bill, and that the Government are taking action. Their action is being taken step by step&#8212;it is rather gradualist&#8212;and that may be frustrating for some of us, but we should not make the best the enemy of the good. We should recognise the positive steps that are being taken</p>
	<p pid="b.673.0/3">in the Bill, not least in the context of the Government&#8217;s earlier action in setting a timetable for the introduction of universal microchipping. That will help us to identify the real culprits, who&#8212;as many Members have pointed out&#8212;are irresponsible dog owners as much as the dogs themselves, some of which are just more victims of this phenomenon.</p>
	<p pid="b.673.0/4"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40696" name="Steve Reed">The hon. Member for Croydon North (Mr Reed)</phrase> and others have made a strong case for dog control orders. I have been sympathetic to that idea for many years, but I should be content if we could achieve the same outcome by other means. I understand the Government&#8217;s position; I realise that their main purpose is to simplify and rationalise antisocial behaviour legislation without sacrificing flexibility. The Bill underlines the important point that the issue of dangerous dogs is inextricably linked with that of human antisocial behaviour. If we can tackle one by tackling the other, I shall be satisfied, even if the legislation does not include the actual words &#8220;dog control order&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.673.0/5">One of the most important provisions involves the extension of liability for dangerous dogs to private property. Liberty has expressed some concern about the so-called &#8220;bite a burglar&#8221; provisions, and I think that Ministers need to consider those carefully. Our two contradictory instincts are to say, quite rightly, that burglars who enter other people&#8217;s properties with malicious intent should do so entirely at their own risk, and to support the extension to private property of liability for the dangerous behaviour of animals. Both are worthy instincts, and resolving that conflict will be a difficult task for Ministers. I speak as the brother of a postal worker who is very keen for the Bill to proceed.</p>

	<p pid="b.674.1/1">I am sorry, but I will not, because of the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.674.1/2">Another important provision, which has not been mentioned much in the debate so far, is clause 99, which begins the necessary shift from breed to deed. It requires a court to establish whether a dog is</p>
	<p pid="b.674.1/3">&#8220;a danger to public safety&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.674.1/4">given</p>
	<p pid="b.674.1/5">&#8220;the temperament of the dog and its past behaviour&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.674.1/6">and to establish whether the dog&#8217;s owner is a &#8220;fit and proper person&#8221; to own a dog. I agree with the criticism by the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge of the rather strange list of obscure breeds, which I am not sure that most police forces would recognise even if they came across them. I do not know whether we will eventually abolish that list, but I certainly think it significant that the Bill is embarking on that shift towards tackling deed and behaviour rather than just breed.</p>
	<p pid="b.674.1/7">I have some sympathy for the amendments tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the hon. Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase>. They seek tougher sentencing, underlining the fact that in many instances dogs are used as lethal weapons, and that we should see that in the context of the responsibility of their owners. I also have some sympathy for the amendment tabled by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40578" name="Ann Coffey">the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey)</phrase>, as, I think, will legions of Liberal Democrat &#8220;Focus&#8221; deliverers.

	<p pid="b.674.1/8">leaflets through letter boxes. A deliverer can take some responsible action. The paddle now bears a good many teeth marks, which could have been on my fingers. Councillor Reid made it by cutting up old &#8220;Yes to the alternative vote&#8221; campaign placards, which is probably one of the lesser but more positive outcomes of that campaign.</p>

	<p pid="b.675.0/1">Is it not true that, if we legislate specifically to require dog owners to put guards on their letter boxes, we will run the danger of neglecting the other risks that people face when they go on to private property, such as dogs running free in back gardens? Is it not the case that there are a number of possibilities in terms of dog attacks once someone passes the boundary of the gate?</p>

	<p pid="b.675.1/1">It is important that the Government consult carefully on all these things. We do not want to intrude too much into the realm of private property and what people are allowed to do with their dogs in their property, but the point that the hon. Lady makes is well made.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.1/2">I ask the Minister to consider carefully the campaign by Naturewatch, which is based in my constituency and led me to table early-day motion 412 to address the issues of irresponsible breeders and the need to regulate the advertising and selling of pets. That could be the next important step that the Government take in their rather gradualist approach to the issue. In many ways, that is one of the root causes of the phenomenon of dangerous and trophy dogs and dogs used as weapons.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.1/3">For now, however, we should congratulate the Government on taking some important steps to tackle the issue. The steps we are voting on today will help to save lives. They will potentially save the lives of children like poor Jade Anderson and the lives of adults. They will certainly save the lives of pets. Those steps are overwhelmingly to be welcomed.</p>

	<p pid="b.675.2/1">In November four years ago, my constituent, John Paul Massey, was killed by a dog in Wavertree. He was four. It happened during the run-up to the general election. I remember the impact that his death had not only on his family and their friends but on the wider community. To this day, I have people who come to talk to me about the experience of that happening in our community and how it has impacted on them, even though they may just have been a neighbour or someone who lived in a neighbouring street. It is not just John Paul Massey who tragically lost his life. Hon. Members on both sides of the House have mentioned many other victims. One life lost because of a dog is one life too many. I hope that the Minister will reflect on that in his response.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/2">I am going to echo many of the comments made by hon. Friends and Members on the Government Benches. I notice that there are people present who have been long-standing campaigners on the issue for far longer than I have following my election in May 2010. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" name="Angela Smith">the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith)</phrase> for the hard work that she has done for so many more years than I have on the issue. My hon. Friend the Member for Bolton West</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/3">(Julie Hilling) has been affected in more recent times. We have heard the worst examples and seen evidence in newspapers and on television of the most tragic injuries and of people who are permanently disfigured. As we have heard, every year, thousands of people are hospitalised. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people are attacked by a dog and may not present themselves to the NHS. For many of those people, there are long-term psychological consequences. For people on the front line who go into homes, be they social workers, BT workers, meter readers or energy company staff, such attacks can have a long-term impact on their ability to work.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/4">As we have heard, the attacks come at a great cost. The estimates that we have are very conservative. There is a cost of &#163;10 million a year to the NHS. That should cause any Government concern. Equally, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40530" name="Mark Spencer">the hon. Member for Sherwood (Mr Spencer)</phrase> said, people who are visually impaired will be affected if their guide dog is attacked. I do not think that enough of us know&#8212;I learned this only recently&#8212;that it costs &#163;50,000 to train and look after a guide dog over its lifetime. That is all charitable money. If a guide dog is attacked by a dog, not only will there be a cost and long-term consequences for the guide dog, but the owner, who has spent time bonding with the guide dog and has depended on it, will no longer have a friend. That can also have long-term consequences.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/5">I support new clause 3, which is in my name and that of many hon. Friends, because I share the criticism by the Select Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and many hon. Members on both sides of the House. Although I welcome what the Government have done on the issue, the clear message that I have heard from professionals in the field is that we should prevent dog attacks from happening in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/6">I have listened very closely to the contributions of Members on both sides of the House, in particular those on the Government Benches who spoke in support of what the Government have come forward with thus far. I have also looked very closely at the community protection notices and I have listened to the professionals who know far better than I do how this will operate in practice, and I will listen very carefully to the Minister&#8217;s response, too, but I have strong concerns. As it stands, CPNs are very bureaucratic and practitioners will need a lot of time and resource to implement them. They will not sufficiently address dog behaviour and welfare. That is, essentially, what all of us here are talking about today. There are also concerns that the CPN will come too late, because the dog owner must be served with a written warning before they can be issued with a CPN.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/7">I support dog control notices as I believe they would increase the profile of the issues and awareness of them among the target audience. They would also serve to impress upon enforcers the need to ensure expertise among those authorised to issue notices. We have not spoken about what a DCN would specifically do. It would place a responsibility on an owner to undertake requirements tailored to the need of the individual and their dog. That could be something as simple as the use of a lead or a muzzle at an appropriate time, or the maintenance of a dog-proof fence, or a request to undertake some training. I have attended events the Dogs Trust puts on for free, so I have met many people</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/8">who love their pet but do not have the skills or expertise to best look after it. A DCN could address that very well.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/9">The focus of a DCN is on education and supporting the individual, rather than being punitive to the owner or dog. I urge the Minister to think very seriously about this issue because we have a problem in this country. We see it in communities all the time, and not just in inner-city urban communities, but in rural communities too. We need something that is going to deal with dog attacks effectively, so we never again open a newspaper or switch on our TV and learn of somebody tragically being maimed or losing their life because of a dog.</p>
	<p pid="b.675.2/10">I know the Minister is new in his post, and I urge him to listen to the professionals, including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Dogs Trust, the Kennel Club, the British Veterinary Association and others, and also to the Communication Workers Union, which represents thousands of postmen and women who deliver our mail every day, and up to 20 of whom are attacked just delivering our post. I ask the Minister to consider the new clause again. If the Government are not going to support it today, I urge them to consider it in the other place, because we need serious action to prevent dog attacks in the first place.</p>

	<p pid="b.677.0/1">I welcome what the Government are doing. It is quite brave. Dealing with any topic such as this one fuels great passions. All of us love dogs, but those of us who are parents feel slight fear when we see an unruly dog in a playground or somewhere else.</p>
	<p pid="b.677.0/2">We have to strike a proper balance. The whole thrust of what the Government are doing in this area is to simplify and make flexible antisocial behaviour legislation so it can be more easily used. Therefore I urge the Minister to resist most of the amendments, although I accept they have been tabled for understandable and strong reasons, and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" name="Julie Hilling">the hon. Member for Bolton West (Julie Hilling)</phrase> certainly made a very good contribution. We ought to go forward with what is being proposed, which is CPNs, and see whether they deliver what the Government have assured us they will.</p>
	<p pid="b.677.0/3">There are DPNs in Scotland and Northern Ireland and the Government have looked at them and concluded they would rather have CPNs. If devolution is to mean anything, it must allow Scotland and Northern Ireland to go their own way and the rest of the United Kingdom to go a different way if it perceives that is a better way to deal with the problem.</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> said. The Committee came up with some refreshing ideas. Some of the Back-Bench Members had meetings with Ministers, including the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Minister Lord de Mauley. The refreshing thing was that they were prepared to look at the issue of the tariff and sentencing. A consultation</p>
	<p pid="b.677.2/3">took place in the summer, and although my hon. Friend is disappointed that it has not yet been published and any changes will be made in the House of Lords, by Whitehall standards this is the speed of light: we have a Bill, we meet a Minister, the Minister undertakes to have a consultation, we have the consultation and in a matter of weeks something will come back to the other place.

	<p pid="b.678.1/1">Absolutely. Progress has been made and the Government listened to our Committee debates. I was surprised that my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40159" name="Tracey Crouch">the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch)</phrase>, who mentioned cats, did not mention Mungo and Basil, as they got a mention in Committee. It was an interesting Committee and things were well debated. We made proposals that will improve the Bill. I urge the Minister to resist most of the amendments, but to consider the amendment to do with the tariff, which needs to be given serious consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.678.1/2">To go back to my first point, the Bill is about simplifying things and making them more flexible, and I urge the Minister to resist more complicated legislation. Let us get on with the job and let us make it easier for legislators. This is a good Bill, extending the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to private property and protecting assistance dogs. It contains a lot of good things and if we can get the tariff up as well, it will be a result for those who served on the Committee and for this House.</p>

	<p pid="b.678.2/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40483" name="Robert Syms">the hon. Member for Poole (Mr Syms)</phrase> and it was good to hear him speaking in the House, after a period in the Whips on the Front Bench, although what he had to say was still a little too loyal for my taste.</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/2">I welcome clause 98 and the extension of the offence of allowing a dog to cause injury or the fear of injury to all places, including all private property. That is long awaited and closes a significant loophole in the law. Ministers have simply been much to slow to make this change. Today, however, particularly with new clause 3, the new Minister has the opportunity to act ahead of a serious and growing problem, instead of just giving a long-delayed response to a problem, as we have seen so far. I am talking about the introduction of dog control notices.</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/3">We know that thousands of victims are injured and hospitalised each year as a result of dog attacks. We know that the number of owners sentenced for offences related to dangerous dogs has increased by more than one third since 2009. Just in South Yorkshire the police tell me that in the past year they have responded to 464 dog attack incidents, and that just in 2013 they have so far taken out 26 court cases pursuing prosecution against those owners.</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/4">The latest case reported to me was that of Rebecca Lowman of Goldthorpe, who was attacked and badly injured in the arm and leg last month when she was defending a woman who was being attacked by her own dog in her own house. While Becky was still in hospital,</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/5">I sat down with her husband John, who was very upset by Becky&#8217;s injuries and very angry that the police had no ability to act on that dog because the attack took place in that private house.</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/6">Since I started campaigning on this issue in the past few weeks, a lot of people have contacted me, including Norma Saunders, who told me that she knows someone who was a victim of a dog attack. She said:</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/7">&#8220;After the dog attacked several times, our community felt terrorized. I did not let my little boy play in the garden &amp; I did not walk to the shops, but the authorities were not interested.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/8">I pay tribute to Hallam FM in South Yorkshire, which has taken up this campaign, aired the problems and given listeners the chance to give their experiences over the past week. A couple have phoned in with very powerful points. One said that the law must be changed:</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/9">&#8220;I was mauled by an American Pitt bull crossed with a Bull mastiff at my friend&#8217;s house and as it was in its rightful house nothing could have been done&#8230;I have been left with traumatic memories and ugly scars, this dog has not been put down and has in fact bitten someone else&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/10">Another caller simply said that we should</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/11">&#8220;just do what is definitely necessary to prevent any more horrific and fatal attacks on innocent people and children.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/12">The Minister has the chance to do just that this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/13">I urge the Minister, taking advantage of his fresh mandate as a new Minister in a new post, to accept new clause 3. Dog control notices have been legislated for in Scotland for three years and this represents a sensible extension of the scope for local authorities, courts and the police to take action against a person in control of a dog whose behaviour is out of control. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40372" name="Luciana Berger">the Member for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger)</phrase> has explained some of the steps and sanctions available to the authorities when a dog control notice is in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.678.2/14">Labour has been arguing this case but Ministers have been dragging their feet for three years now. During that time, thousands more have suffered serious and often debilitating injuries. Most dog owners are responsible and their dogs are well behaved, but a minority see dogs as status symbols or even offensive weapons. The Government must go further than this Bill. Closing the loophole in the legislation over attacks on some private property is a sensible step, but one that they have been pushed to take. Let us see Ministers take the next sensible step this afternoon, introduce and accept the principle of dog control notices and help to reverse the rising trend of attacks and to head off some of the attacks we will otherwise definitely see, which will leave adults and children badly scarred, badly injured, badly traumatised and, in some cases, dead.</p>

	<p pid="b.679.0/1">I support the Government&#8217;s gradualist and sensible approach and I urge the Minister to resist new clause 3. We all regret and are desperately unhappy about vicious attacks by dogs, particularly on children&#8212;although also on anybody else&#8212;and if legislation could solve that problem and new clause 3 could deal with it without causing massive potential inconvenience to millions of peaceable people who own dogs, I would be in favour of it. However, like all such amendments, it would probably, sadly, do little to control the vicious people who use dogs as weapons and it could impact severely on millions of ordinary, peaceable dog owners.</p>
	<p pid="b.679.0/2">I declare an interest because, like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am a dog owner. My dog, a little border terrier called William, is a lot smaller than yours. I saw yours in the Westminster dog show last year and many people think that your breed of dog is quite powerful, but I know from having witnessed your dog that it is well brought up and peaceable.</p>
	<p pid="b.679.0/3">Let us be sensible about this. I know that new clause 3 is well intentioned, but it could have draconian effects. All it states is:</p>
	<p pid="b.679.0/4">&#8220;Where an authorised officer has reasonable cause to believe that a dog is not under sufficient control&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.679.0/5">It requires a reasonable belief&#8212;that is not probability. We all know that there are disputes between neighbours, or that people have rows with other people. That is such a small bar to get over for an &#8220;authorised officer&#8221;.</p>

	<p pid="b.680.1/2">Let me make a simple point. Who is this &#8220;authorised officer&#8221;? What is this &#8220;reasonable cause&#8221;? Simply because that officer of the state has some sort of belief, which might have been motivated by other people, the dog might have to be muzzled, neutered or prevented from going in particular places. I am very worried about that.</p>
	<p pid="b.680.1/3">I am also very worried about the other amendments. I do not agree with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase>, who was talking about 14-year sentences. It was in the papers last year that somebody had driven their car dangerously and killed somebody while they were looking at their global positioning system device. They did not look out of the window for 18 seconds and they killed a cyclist, and they went to prison for three years. We all think that is ridiculous. Are we really going to send someone to prison for 14 years?</p>
	<p pid="b.680.1/4">Let us be honest about it. Dogs have been bred for thousands of years to be guard dogs. Even my pathetic little border terrier, William, barks when people come up the garden path. That is what dogs are bred to do. All this nonsense about Liberal party canvassers who are scared of getting their fingers bitten when they put a leaflet through the door&#8212;I have delivered thousands of useless Conservative party pamphlets through the door. When I see a dog behind the door, I am delighted not to put the pamphlet through the letterbox. Just show some common sense. Dogs are dogs. We cannot change dogs with legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.680.1/5">New clause 3 is just one extra bit of legislation that will not impact on the people who really cause trouble, but will, as I said, impact on millions of dog owners. We should be calm, take a gradualist approach and support what the Government are doing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.680.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="680"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew42">
	<p pid="b.680.2/1">We have had a good wide-ranging debate. In the time left available to me, I will try as always to address the points that have been raised, but if I am unable to respond to all of them, I will write to the individual Members who have raised points and have not had those addressed as part of my response.</p>
	<p pid="b.680.2/2">Let me say first that we are very sympathetic to the calls from many people for an increase in the maximum penalty for a dog attack. The Government agree that</p>
	<p pid="b.680.2/3">two years&#8217; imprisonment is not a sufficient penalty for the devastation and damage that a serious dog attack can do. There were over 3,000 responses to the consultation, and although there was strong support for an increased maximum penalty, there was no consensus as to where to set the bar. Given the volume of responses, I regret that it has not been possible for the Department to conclude its consideration of the issue in time to table a Government amendment on Report, but I can reassure my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40067" name="Richard Fuller">the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)</phrase> that the Government will table an amendment to increase the maximum penalties for dog attacks when the Bill is in the other place. The response to the consultation on changes will, I can assure the shadow Minister, be published in good time to inform the debates on the issue in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.680.2/4">The Government amendment will reflect the high public concern that two years is an insufficient penalty for these offences, and the fact that some 16 adults and children have died in dog attacks since 2005, and some 10 assistance dogs are attacked by other dogs every month. As the consultation made clear, we will be looking to distinguish between attacks on people and attacks on assistance dogs. For attacks on people and where a person is killed or seriously injured, I am attracted&#8212;perhaps given my former role as a Transport Minister&#8212;by the comparison with penalties for causing death or serious injury by dangerous driving. Where a dog attacks an assistance dog, we will be looking at a lower maximum penalty, but one that is higher than the present one that applies.</p>
	<p pid="b.680.2/5">I should say to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40266" name="Edward Leigh">the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase> that some people are breeding dogs deliberately to use as weapons. It is under those circumstances that higher penalties would be applicable. I hope that in the light of the reassurances that I have given on this matter, and the commitment that I am giving to a Government amendment, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40531" name="Philip Davies">the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)</phrase> will not press his amendments today.</p>
	<p pid="b.680.2/6">New clauses 3, 6, 17, 18 and 19 deal with dog control notices, dog number control notices and the requirement for all households with a dog to fit letterbox guards. I understand the intentions of hon. Members who tabled these amendments. There is a genuine need for an additional tool to address poor dog ownership and to enable early action to prevent dog bites and attacks. I understand the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40578" name="Ann Coffey">the hon. Member for Stockport (Ann Coffey)</phrase>, who sought to take matters forward with her new clause 18. Every day thousands of postal workers and others, including those who deliver political literature, face uncertainty and apprehension as they approach houses with dogs to deliver mail and so on. The Government believe that such individuals must be able to go about their duties without fear of injury.</p>
	<p pid="b.680.2/7">It is paramount for local officers from the police or the local council to have at their disposal the right tools so that they may take action in cases of irresponsible dog ownership. But as was made clear when the issue was raised on Second Reading and again in Committee, the measures in parts 1 to 4 introduce powers that will allow exactly the type of early intervention that the new clauses seek to provide.</p>
	<p pid="b.680.2/8">Those measures can address all types of such irresponsible behaviour with a dog, regardless of the specific manifestation. For example, a community protection notice can be served in cases where there are too many dogs in one home&#8212;the point made by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" name="Julie Hilling">the hon. Member for Bolton West (Julie Hilling)</phrase>&#8212;where an owner does not have proper control of his or her dog, where a dog strays and in many other scenarios. Those measures are in addition to existing statutory measures, notably offences under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 relating to welfare standards, the law on statutory nuisance and, for commercial dog breeders, any licence requirements.</p>
	<p pid="b.680.2/9">I want to reassure Members&#8212;this is an important point&#8212;that all the requirements they suggest under new clauses 3 and 6, such as muzzling, neutering, microchipping, keeping a dog on a lead, attending training classes, fitting a letterbox guard to the door of a property and seeking expert advice, can be required under a community protection notice. The new clauses, although well intentioned, are simply not necessary. The powers are already there in the Bill. To pick up on a point made by the shadow Minister, that is how the Liberal Democrat and Conservative manifesto commitments are being delivered.</p>

	<p pid="b.682.0/1">Will the Minister acknowledge that, as the legislation is currently drafted, individuals will still require a written warning before they can receive a community protection notice, which will add delays? Who knows what could happen during the intervening period?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.682.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" speakername="Norman Baker" colnum="682"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew44">
	<p pid="b.682.1/1">I want to address that point. Only this month the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs published a draft practitioners&#8217; manual&#8212;it is a draft because we are inviting comments on it&#8212;entitled, &#8220;Tackling irresponsible dog ownership&#8221;. It gives an example on page 15. If a dog is out of control in a park, a written notice can be issued on the spot by the relevant officer who has control in that situation. The owner would then be given a &#8220;reasonable time&#8221;, which might be just five minutes, to respond. If the dog is not brought under control in that time, the community protection notice can be issued right away. I do not understand why the Opposition think that there could be huge delays in the process, because there could not. It is a simple piece of legislation to make it effective and quick, and that relates to the issues to which attention is rightly being drawn.</p>

	<p pid="b.682.2/1">I am concerned about the term &#8220;owner&#8221;, because the person in control of the dog in the park might not be the owner, so the &#8220;It&#8217;s my cousin&#8217;s dog&#8221; defence could deflect the notice.</p>

	<p pid="b.682.3/1">The provision might specify the person in control of the dog, so if I have that wrong I will correct it. I absolutely accept my hon. Friend&#8217;s point and will reflect on it.</p>
	<p pid="b.682.3/2">The measures in the Bill go further and allow officers to make innovative requirements based on the specifics of the case they are dealing with, for example by requesting that signage be put up to warn visitors to a property of the presence of a dog, or that a letterbox guard be</p>
	<p pid="b.682.3/3">fitted. I have genuinely heard nothing during the course of the debate to suggest that there is a gap in what is proposed in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.682.3/4">The Local Government Association stated in written evidence to the Public Bill Committee:</p>
	<p pid="b.682.3/5">&#8220;The LGA remains to be convinced that separate tools are necessary as no details have been provided of the specific gaps in the provisions for the injunctions, community protection notices or public space protection orders that a dog control notice is needed to fill.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.682.3/6">We all share the objective of trying to do something about this matter, but Opposition Members seem to think that a measure cannot be effective if it does not have the word &#8220;dog&#8221; in the title, which is simply wrong.</p>

	<p pid="b.683.2/1">It is not just the Opposition who are making those points; so too are many experienced organisations, including the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Association of Chief Police Officers, the British Veterinary Association, Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home and this House&#8217;s Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee. All of those organisations have more experience in this area than either the Minister or I have, yet he is not taking their views on board.</p>

	<p pid="b.683.3/1">The shadow Minister made that point in his opening remarks. I have not been a Home Office Minister for long, but I dealt with dog legislation for many years in opposition, so I think I know what the legislation says. I have given him an absolute assurance that the issues the Opposition are concerned about, as am I, such as microchipping and neutering, could all be dealt with under the community protection notice. I have given the hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree an assurance that those matters can be dealt with very quickly. Those are the two points that the Opposition are perfectly correct to pursue, and I have given answers that I had hoped would satisfy them. I guess the proof of the pudding is in the eating. As far as I am concerned, the measures they want to deal with the problem that they, and we, have identified are in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.683.3/2">Notwithstanding that, I understand the concern that, as Labour Members have said, any dog issues may be lost in the breadth of these measures. However, these powers recognise, first, that antisocial behaviour does not come packaged into distinct areas, and secondly, that what matters is whether it can be dealt with quickly and effectively, which is what the Bill does. The practitioners&#8217; manual from DEFRA is the Government&#8217;s attempt to reassure people that these matters will be dealt with properly.</p>

	<p pid="b.683.4/1">Does the Minister recognise that sometimes it is not the attacks themselves that cause anxiety but the intimidating nature of some of the dogs that are attached to what I would call dangerous owners? That blights the lives of people trying to use the parks. Just the presence of this intimidating animal with its owner can do some damage.</p>

	<p pid="b.684.0/1">I do recognise that. That is a good reason why it is better to have flexible, general legislation rather than specific legislation that then creates loopholes.

	<p pid="b.684.2/1">I must not, because I have lots of people to try to reply to. I am sorry.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.2/2">I hope that I have been able to persuade Opposition Members that the approach put forward in the new clause is already provided for in the Bill. If they were minded to press it, I would invite the House to reject it. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i></p>
	<p pid="b.684.2/3"><phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40476" name="Angela Smith">The hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith)</phrase>, who is seeking to intervene while I am trying to respond to her points, proposes to reduce the time delay that can take place following the seizure of a suspected section 1 dog, such as a pit bull terrier, before it is examined by expert witnesses for the defence or prosecution to assess whether it is a prohibited dog. I understand her concerns about the impact that such delays can have on the welfare of dogs. That is why we are committed to bringing forward regulations next year to make it clear that when the police seize a suspected prohibited dog they will not be required to kennel it, but need do so only where they are satisfied that the situation of dog and owner do not present a risk to public safety. It is right to give the police this discretion, and that is the aim that we intend to take forward. It will be a condition of release, if release occurs, that the owner consents to the dog being muzzled and on a lead in public, as well as being microchipped and neutered before it can be released back to the owner. This is to ensure public safety and to prevent breeding from section 1 dogs. On that basis, we do not consider the hon. Lady&#8217;s new clause 29 to be necessary.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.2/4">I now want to deal with the amendments eloquently presented by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40159" name="Tracey Crouch">the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch)</phrase>, which seek to extend the offence in section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to cover incidents where a dog injures or kills a protected animal. I entirely understand and sympathise with her reason for proposing that measure. She listed some of the existing legislation, which does have an effect and can be used in certain circumstances, including the Animal Welfare Act 2006, the Animals Act 1971, the Dogs Act 1871, and the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953. It is rather unfortunate that the Criminal Damage Act 1971 classifies animals as goods or property in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.2/5">I understand the concern of people whose cat is savaged by a dog, but the way forward is to consider other solutions. Instead of more legislation, we want better education for owners, training for dogs, and increased awareness among the public and the authorities who can use the new antisocial behaviour powers to address these incidents and help to prevent them before they happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.2/6">I draw my hon. Friend&#8217;s attention to particular resources in legislation in respect of horses, which she mentioned. The Dangerous Dogs Act would apply in a situation where a dog threatens or attacks a horse and a rider, because the rider is likely to have &#8220;reasonable apprehension&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.684.2/7">that the dog will injure them, and therefore an offence would be created. My hon. Friend also referred to the livestock issues that I mentioned earlier. We are keen to make sure that other animals are protected. However, as I said, the general nature of the legislation provides options through, for example, the injunction procedure to see whether there are other avenues that can be taken to deal with dogs that present a danger to the public and, indeed, to other animals.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.2/8">On amendment 142, tabled by the hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge, I regret that because of the lack of time I will have to write to her with a specific response to the point she raises.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.2/9">The actions that this Government are taking in tackling dangerous dogs are absolutely right. Everybody in the House agrees that that needs to happen better than it has done in the past, and I believe the Bill will achieve that. The provisions will enable all the dreadful acts that have been taking place to be tackled in a sensible and effective way.</p>

	<p pid="b.689.0/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I take the opportunity to welcome for his last hurrah on this Bill <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase>, before he moves to the equally exciting field of immigration policy. It is an area that&#8212;I say this with some experience&#8212;I know he will find life enhancing.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/3">The Bill has been much improved by the scrutiny of this House. We often beat ourselves up&#8212;and are beaten up by people outside&#8212;about the level and quality of scrutiny we apply to legislation in this House, but I think the Bill is now in better shape than it was when it entered Committee, and for that I thank hon. Members from across the House. Foremost among the improvements is the insertion of a whole new part of the Bill at the instigation of my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40472" name="Nicola Blackwood">the Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood)</phrase>, and 67 other right hon. and hon. Members from across the House who supported new clause 5. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the energy and perseverance she has shown in pursuit of her Childhood Lost campaign.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/4">In 2012-13, well over 1,000 people were convicted in this country of offences relating to child sexual exploitation. It is a horrible and repulsive crime and we owe it to the victims, and to all children, to do all we can to eliminate it. Prosecutions and convictions are essential, but by then, of course, the damage is done&#8212;or, as my hon. Friend put it, a childhood has been lost. We must therefore do more to prevent such horrendous crimes from occurring in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/5">Civil orders, which help protect the public from individuals whose behaviour means there is a risk that they will sexually abuse or otherwise sexually harm others, play an important part in our prevention strategy.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/6">Although provision for such orders has been in statute for 10 years, and there are many cases in which they have been used effectively, it is clear that the current regime in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 is too inflexible. Instead of supporting the protection of vulnerable children, it places unreasonable obstacles in the way of keeping them safe. The new sexual harm prevention order and sexual risk order will simplify and strengthen the current powers available to the police, rebalancing the scales of justice in favour of children and vulnerable adults.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/7">In many respects, the approach we are taking to the reform of civil prevention orders under the Sexual Offences Act mirrors our approach to antisocial behaviour powers, and as in that case, the Bill sweeps away the complex and bureaucratic array of powers that put unnecessary obstacles in the way of front-line professionals taking fast and effective action to protect vulnerable people and communities. With the ASBO, however, there was an additional problem because the existing powers simply do not work. ASBOs can take many months to obtain, and, once secured, most are breached with more than four in 10 breached repeatedly. We need powers that will not only offer fast and immediate protection for those at risk of harm, but drive a change in behaviour and provide a long-term solution.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/8">In her article in <i>The Independent </i>last month, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40048" name="Gloria De Piero">the hon. Member for Ashfield (Gloria De Piero)</phrase> bemoaned the fact that the ASBO is &#8220;much maligned&#8221;. She has recently moved on from the Home Affairs brief, on which I congratulate her, but I put it to her and to her colleagues who remain on the Front Benches that it is also time to move on from the ASBO. The ASBO is maligned for the good reason that it has been ineffective, and the Bill will rightly see the back of it.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/9">As well as ensuring that front-line professionals have the powers they need, our reforms place the victim at the heart of the response to antisocial behaviour. The community remedy will be enhanced if it is developed locally within a national framework. Out-of-court disposals must be seen to be a fair and effective way of dealing with offending behaviour if they are to have the confidence of the community. To achieve that, each and every one should have a punitive, restorative or rehabilitative element, or a combination of those. I commend my hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40535" name="Stephen Phillips">the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Stephen Phillips)</phrase> for his comments about strengthening the provisions of the Bill to that end. Out-of-court disposals must be used appropriately, and as I have repeatedly said, they should only be used as the first response to low-level offending. When the seriousness of an offence, or the frequency of the offending behaviour, warrants prosecution, prosecution is what should happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/10">Under the Bill, victims of antisocial behaviour will be able to take advantage of the community trigger. No one should have to suffer repeated incidents of antisocial behaviour because the police, local authority or landlord repeatedly fails to respond to the victim&#8217;s call for action.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/11">The community trigger will give victims the power to demand a case review. That case review must assess whether further action is required, and it can result in the relevant authority being required to take appropriate action. That is real accountability. It gives ordinary people real power to compel the authorities to respond in a way that will stop them being victimised.</p>
	<p pid="b.689.0/12">After the debate on Report and the House&#8217;s clear rejection of new clause 3, I hope we can move on from the debate about dog control notices. Hon. Members on both sides of the House agree on the need for more effective preventive powers to tackle irresponsible dog owners. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has published the draft of a comprehensive practitioners manual that shows how the new antisocial behaviour powers in the Bill can be used to tackle dog-related problems. I put it to the House that the time has come for all parties, including animal welfare groups, the police, local authorities and others, to work together to ensure that the provisions in the Bill deliver the outcomes we all want.</p>

	<p pid="b.691.0/1">The Minister will know very well that responsibility for policing and justice was devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2010, but bits of clause 98, on dangerous dogs, appear to apply to Northern Ireland. I do not understand why some bits and pieces apply to Northern Ireland when other bits and pieces do not, but on the bits that apply, what consultation was there with the Northern Ireland Department of Justice and the Northern Ireland Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, which is responsible for dogs?</p>

	<p pid="b.691.1/1">I am happy to assure the hon. Lady that, throughout the passage of the Bill and on many other matters, there has been regular, continuous contact at all levels. I see the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice regularly, and our officials are in contact on detailed matters. We work closely with the Northern Ireland Department of Justice.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.691.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40101" speakername="Julie Hilling" colnum="691"  time="016:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew59">
	<p pid="b.691.2/1">The Minister says he hopes the charities and so on get behind the Bill. It is not too late for him to reconsider and listen to what they say on how to improve the Bill rather than asking them to support measures that they believe are second best.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.691.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="691"  time="016:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew60">
	<p pid="b.691.3/1">I sense the hon. Lady is trying to lure me into a debate she has just had with my hon. Friend the Minister. I heard his speech, in which he replied fully to the points made by her and others. She says it is not too late, but, in practical terms, it is&#8212;we have just had a Division and have moved on to Third Reading. <i>[</i><i>Interruption.</i><i>]</i> There will indeed be debates in other places.</p>
	<p pid="b.691.3/2">The examination and detention of David Miranda at Heathrow airport in August has put a renewed spotlight on the changes we are making in the Bill to the powers in schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000. Schedule 7 remains a key part of the UK&#8217;s border security arrangements and is vital to preserving the safety of the public. I welcome the renewed scrutiny of the provisions. It is right that, as part of his function of reporting on the operation of the Terrorism Acts, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC, has decided to investigate and report on the exercise of the powers in Mr Miranda&#8217;s case. The Government will carefully consider his report when it is received.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.691.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" speakername="Julian Huppert" colnum="691"  time="016:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew61">
	<p pid="b.691.4/1">We had a slightly truncated debate on that earlier. The Home Secretary has rightly expressed concern about the use of stop and search&#8212;it disproportionately affects the ethnic minority population&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.691.4/2">and taken steps to deal with it. Given that a huge proportion of people who are stopped under schedule 7 are ethnic minorities&#8212;it is massively disproportionate&#8212;does the Minister agree that similar actions should be taken on schedule 7 stops?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.692.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="692"  time="016:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew62">
	<p pid="b.692.0/1">The sensible thing to do is to wait for Mr Anderson&#8217;s report and then decide what changes, if any, are needed. Let us look at the evidence and then decide what changes are necessary, because the police need the power to stop, question and, when necessary, detain and search people travelling through airports and ports if they are to be able to determine whether an individual is, or has been, involved in terrorism. That power is essential to the prevention of terrorism because it enables the police to detect and disrupt individuals who might be travelling for the purposes of planning, financing and training for terrorist attacks.</p>
	<p pid="b.692.0/2">The amendments to schedule 7 are in line with the Government&#8217;s continuing commitment to ensure that respect for individual freedoms is balanced appropriately and carefully against the need to reduce the threat of terrorism to the British public and British interests overseas. I have no doubt that the other place will want to examine the provisions particularly closely, including in the light of Mr Anderson&#8217;s report, but we should wait until we have all had the opportunity to look at the report before rushing to make a judgment on whether we have the balance right.</p>
	<p pid="b.692.0/3">I should say a few words about the much expanded part 11, which deals with extradition. The ability to extradite people to and from this country is an important component of our criminal justice system. Those who commit serious crimes should not be able to evade justice by crossing international borders to escape arrest. We owe it to the victims of crime to ensure that there are efficient and effective arrangements in place to prevent justice being denied in that way.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.692.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40247" speakername="Nick de Bois" colnum="692"  time="016:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew63">
	<p pid="b.692.1/1">The Minister says that the Bill was improved in Committee and on the Floor of the House. While I am sure that that is the case for most of the Bill, he is well aware that we did not have the opportunity to scrutinise Government new clauses on extradition, or discuss the amendments tabled by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40253" name="Dominic Raab">the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab)</phrase> and 28 other hon. Members from across the House. How confident is the Minister that we are providing protections that British citizens have lacked in the past?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.692.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40049" speakername="Damian Green" colnum="692"  time="016:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#131015-0003.htm_spnew64">
	<p pid="b.692.2/1">I am conscious of my hon. Friend&#8217;s particular constituency interest, which he has pursued diligently. I am sure that he and I agree that our extradition arrangements need to be fair and proportionate. It is a big step to extradite a person from one country to another. The impact on family life and employment will be far greater than in cases where a person is prosecuted in his or her own country of residence. We should not, therefore, be hoovering up British residents and dispatching them to all corners of Europe to spend months in prison awaiting trial for minor offences. I am sure he would agree with that. That is why in July I recommended to the House that the United Kingdom opt back into the European arrest warrant, but only on condition that we first rectify a number of serious weaknesses in the way it has operated. That is what we are now doing.</p>
	<p pid="b.692.2/2">Part 11 introduces a new proportionality bar to extradition to prevent people being extradited for trivial offences. It also introduces a new bar to extradition where the prosecuting authorities in the requesting state have not yet taken a decision to charge and try the accused. That will stop extradited persons languishing in a foreign jail while an investigation takes place. We will amend the Extradition Act 2003 so that a British citizen cannot be extradited for conduct that is not a crime in this country.</p>
	<p pid="b.692.2/3">These are all important new safeguards that will help to ensure that our extradition arrangements with other EU member states are fair both to the victims of crime and the accused. They are not particularly difficult or onerous. They could and should have been included in the Extradition Act 2003. To leave them out was a mistake, which is being rectified by this Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.692.2/4">This is a significant piece of legislation, one much enhanced as it has made its way through the House. It will help us to cut crime further, to protect the public and to extend the modernisation of the police. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.693.0/1">I thank the Minister for thanking me for my service as shadow spokesperson on police. It is a privilege to move on to another shadow Home Office role. He and I appear to have job swapped in the course of our time on the Bill. I thank my hon.

Friends the Members for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey), for Croydon North (Mr Reed) and for Warrington North (Helen Jones), who joined the shadow Home Office team and worked on the Bill in the past two days. I thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40345" name="Diana Johnson">the Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson)</phrase> for her work on Report. I also thank my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40521" name="Phil Wilson">the Member for Sedgefield (Phil Wilson)</phrase> for his efforts in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/2">I thank the Minister for his consideration during the Bill&#8217;s progress and the Minister of State, Home Department, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40362" name="Norman Baker">the hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker)</phrase>, for his consideration over the last couple of days. I also thank the former Ministers, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40600" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton Deane (Mr Browne)</phrase>, and, in particular, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40483" name="Robert Syms">the hon. Member for Poole (Mr Syms)</phrase>, whom I think, in a challenging Committee full of very different views, did his job with integrity; I personally was sorry to see him leave his post in the recent reshuffle. Members of the Committee, some of whom are present today, know that it was an interesting and exciting time, and I thank them also.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/3">Third Reading is about what is in a Bill, not what might have been, and with that in mind, I will first welcome those aspects of the Bill with which the Opposition agree. We welcome the instigation of the College of Policing, which is an opportunity to provide training and investment and to set standards. We perhaps want to see it develop in different ways from the Government, but it is a positive and forward-looking initiative, and I wish both the chair and the chief officer well in their task.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/4">I welcome the measures on firearms and the intent to supply, which, as I mentioned in Committee, had their genesis even before the last general election. These important provisions will help to reduce the supply of guns, and therefore deaths and criminality.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/5">I welcome the extension of the role of the Independent Police Complaints Commission to private contractors and staff working for police authorities, particularly because my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" name="Yvette Cooper">the Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> proposed such a measure last year. I am pleased that the Government have taken it up. Again, we would like to see further action, but I welcome the provision none the less.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/6">I welcome the measures on terrorism and on terrorists travelling abroad and the long-overdue measures on forced marriage, which, in my view and that of the Committee, will strengthen the legal basis for tackling this immensely challenging problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/7">I particularly welcome new clause 5 and the measures on sexual harm prevention notices, which my hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull North gave a fair wind yesterday. Their introduction to the Bill was a positive development, and I am pleased that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40472" name="Nicola Blackwood">the hon. Member for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood)</phrase> brought them forward, with support from across the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/8">I welcome the measures on witness protection and, as far as they go&#8212;I will return to this shortly&#8212;the measures on dogs, although we think they could have gone further. I particularly welcome the measures against dog attacks in the home.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/9">I welcome the policing pay review body, which we will give a fair wind, but we need to look again at the commissioning of victims&#8217; services by police and crime commissioners, as I still worry that it will lead to the fragmentation of victims&#8217; services across the country.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/10">We therefore welcome several measures in the Bill. We challenged them in Committee, but they remain and broadly have the Opposition&#8217;s support. I have to say, however, that I do not welcome the changes to the ASBO regime or the developments on the injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance. I cannot for the life of me understand why a party that, during my formative political years, prided itself on being the party of law and order continues to bring forward measures that reduce the ability of the police and communities to tackle elements that need tackling in our communities. We have seen it on DNA and CCTV, and we are now seeing it on ASBOs. The changes are a reprehensible and retrograde step.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/11">On the same theme, I do not welcome the same party&#8217;s introducing thresholds for low-value shoplifting, which we had a strong discussion about in Committee. When the Association of Convenience Stores, which represents 33,000 shopkeepers across the country, is worried about such criminality and the changes relating to low-value shoplifting, the party of law and order&#8212;as was, but not anymore&#8212;needs to give some serious consideration to the matter.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/12">We support aspects of the Bill, then, but firmly do not support other aspects. On balance&#8212;to let you into a secret, Madam Deputy Speaker&#8212;Labour Members will give the Bill an unopposed Third Reading, but we will seek to take those matters forward. As I have said, we have to deal with what is in the Bill on Third Reading. We have identified important shortcomings, but we will grant the Third Reading. The Government must reflect further on the issues that have been debated, which have been raised by Members of all parties. Some issues have seen cross-party co-operation&#8212;for example,</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/13">on the importance of dog notices, on the points about covert policing raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Erdington and on how to protect shop workers and other staff from assaults at work. Domestic violence and gun control are other serious issues debated in Committee on which I hope the other place will reflect carefully. Another issue to be considered is that of legal highs and reducing their availability in our communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/14">While we are giving fair wind to the Bill, I hope that the other place will look carefully at the improvements we have suggested and listen not just to what Members have said today about dog notices, but to what all organisations have said about them. We want the other place to look at bringing forward measures to tackle covert policing, to protect people from assaults at work and further to reduce and stop the potential for gun use, for domestic violence and for legal highs.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/15">I thank the Minister for his consideration in Committee, but we think there is more to be done. We think that we have been constructive on Second Reading, in Committee and on Report about the changes that need to be made. Ultimately, we think that the issues I have mentioned that are not covered by the Bill now will be part of it following consideration in the House of Lords.</p>
	<p pid="b.693.0/16">I have enjoyed my role as shadow policing Minister and move on now to shadow Minister on immigration. I thank my colleagues for their support over the three years in opposition and one year in government in which I have discharged this role. I look forward to watching from afar as this Bill is further improved following consideration by the other place.</p>

	<p pid="b.695.0/1">It was a pleasure to serve on the Committee that considered this Bill. It was indeed the first Public Bill Committee on which I served. After my active participation, I am in no doubt that it may well be my last! I was pleased to play a role and I think that we Back Benchers sometimes underestimate and undervalue the work we do in scrutinising legislation, which is an incredibly important aspect of our job. I am proud to have been part of a team that has, as the Minister said, improved the Bill before it goes to the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.695.0/2">I am particularly proud to have made some progress on the issue of bullying&#8212;a subject on which I feel strongly, and I believe that the House should continue to feel strongly about it. It is an issue that affects many children and their parents throughout the country. Building advice on bullying into Home Office guidance is a very positive step forward. I would have liked to see more, but that is for another day. We can continue to discuss online safety and cyber-bullying via the Select Committee on Home Affairs and the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, and I have no doubt that we will come back to those issues at some future date.</p>
	<p pid="b.695.0/3">As I said many times in Committee, I have a great deal of respect for <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase>, but I disagree that we should be harking back to the halcyon days of ASBOs. Although they might have started off as a very good measure for tackling antisocial behaviour, the simple truth is that the breach rates are far too high. Clearly, then, because</p>
	<p pid="b.695.0/4">it is broke, it needs fixing. We can argue about how best to fix it, but I think that the Government proposals will strengthen our response to antisocial behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="b.695.0/5">The Minister and the House will be pleased to hear that I recently attended a residents&#8217; meeting in Chatham at which we discussed the significantly high levels of antisocial behaviour in one small part of a ward. The police told residents that new provisions were going through Parliament as they spoke that would enable them to deal much more effectively with this problem in the future, including by ensuring some sort of community punishment. We have introduced what I consider to be sensible measures to ensure that people who commit crimes do not go into the stocks, but I can tell the Minister that my residents were very keen to put some of those perpetrators of antisocial behaviour into the stocks. I am pleased that we have amended the Bill to provide for proportionality of response, but I am also pleased that there will be an opportunity to impose community punishments such as cleaning up all the litter or getting rid of all the graffiti. That will be greatly welcomed in parts of my constituency.</p>
	<p pid="b.695.0/6">I have no doubt that the House of Lords will improve the Bill further through its precise scrutiny of specific clauses, and that it will consider some of the matters raised by the right hon. Member for Delyn, including legal highs and aspects of the dog legislation with which we have dealt at such length this afternoon, not least the sentencing issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.695.0/7">I am pleased to have played my part in the Bill&#8217;s passage so far, although I am not sure that the Ministers and the former Whip would be so delighted by my active participation. I think that this is a good Bill, and I look forward to its return from the House of Lords.</p>

	<p pid="b.696.0/1">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40159" name="Tracey Crouch">the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch)</phrase>. She has done valuable work in raising the issue of bullying, which blights many children&#8217;s lives and is a very important subject for politicians to consider.</p>
	<p pid="b.696.0/2">This is a Christmas tree of a Bill. When a Bill has so many aspects it makes it difficult to provide enough time for discussion of important issues. However, I think that it has been improved during its passage so far, and it has certainly been given a great deal of scrutiny. I always enjoy the exchanges between <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase> and the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice, which are sometimes robust, and certainly&#8212;in the good parliamentary tradition provide answers to the question of why a Government and an Opposition take particular points of view.</p>
	<p pid="b.696.0/3">The main changes that have been made relate to extradition. There was a fair degree of consensus on the Bill, which was why at one point we had to slow down a little so that the extradition clauses could be tabled. The Committee had also considered the issue of extradition. In recent years, we have seen a number of examples of why the European arrest warrant is sometimes a good thing for Britain. We have seen gangsters extradited from Spain very quickly, sometimes within hours, and identified. One can understand why the Home Secretary is minded to opt back into the arrest warrant, following an opt-out, subject to reassurances.</p>
	<p pid="b.696.0/4">However, we are also aware of many constituency cases in which people have not been treated so well, and human rights have not been dealt with according to the good old British tradition of allowing a someone his day in court. People have been whipped out of the country somewhere abroad, have spent a period in prison, and have ended up either not being charged or being acquitted. It is a pity that we did not have an opportunity to explore that more fully today, although I know that a good many Members will be doing so. Of course, the House of Lords is stuffed full of experts&#8212;lawyers and others who are au fait with the issues&#8212;and I am sure that there will be proper scrutiny in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.696.0/5">I thank the Members who served on the Committee, and I thank the Ministers&#8212;including <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40600" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton Deane (Mr Browne)</phrase>&#8212;for their contribution. We have considered some important issues, including antisocial behaviour, which blights many of our constituencies, and the National Crime Agency, which I think will be a great addition to crime-fighting, particularly across borders. Let us hope that they are considered further, and that we receive the reassurances on extradition that I think the House needs. I think that our constituents and the House will welcome many of those developments.</p>

	<p pid="b.697.2/1">I am sure that we can do that, Madam Deputy Speaker. It seems positively generous, given some of the discussions that we have had today. I am very glad that we agreed yesterday to extend the debate to a second day, although I think that we could have used the time more productively.</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/2">There is clearly a great deal of common ground, and the scrutiny process has clearly been useful. It began with pre-legislative scrutiny by the Home Affairs Committee. The Bill was examined very carefully, and I commend the Government for that. A great deal has been added since then, but it was good to start in that way.</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/3">I think that the large disagreement that remains ultimately comes down to whether we think that antisocial behaviour orders were an effective solution. I very much think that they were not effective. Yesterday, we heard that they were not effective in terms of breaches and that young people often used them as a badge of honour. We have also heard that the public do not think that they were effective. Last year, about 8% of people in an Angus Reid poll said that ASBOs were an effective way of reducing antisocial behaviour. Therefore, I am pleased that we are moving away from them. Unlike the shadow Minister, I am pleased that we are moving from sounding tough on antisocial behaviour to trying to reduce it. There is a difference between the two.</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/4">I still have a number of concerns that I hope their lordships will have a chance to consider. I hope that the Government will reconsider those issues during the passage of the Bill in the Lords. I was pleased by the attitude of</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/5">my hon. Friend the Minister in his maiden speech in his new role. He highlighted that we must not allow injunctions to prevent nuisance and annoyance to</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/6">&#8220;become a means of targeting young people simply for being young people.&#8221;&#8212;[&gt;<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2013-10-14.541"><i>Official Report</i>, 14 October 2013; Vol. 568, c. 541</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/7">That is right. I am sure that the Government would not want that to happen. We must ensure that it does not. However, the breadth of the IPNA still concerns me. What counts as behaviour capable of causing nuisance or annoyance? I think that some draft guidance is going out. That needs to work. IPNAs should not be used to stop reasonable, trivial or benign behaviours that have not caused and are not likely to cause harm to victims or communities. Guidance can be misinterpreted and I hope that their lordships will look further at that issue. We must also ensure that any positive requirements granted are practicable and will not force people into a position where they simply cannot do what they are required to do and hence breach the IPNA.</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/8">I remain concerned about the naming and shaming issue. Judges should do that only where it is necessary. We should have legislation to deal with that. Failing that, the guidance must be expressly clear, but I hope that their lordships will look more carefully at that.</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/9">On eviction, the Joint Committee on Human Rights noted</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/10">&#8220;the seriousness of riot-related offences&#8221;,</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/11">but correctly questioned whether we need a special rule for riot-related antisocial behaviour, because it looks like</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/12">&#8220;a punishment rather than a genuine means of preventing harm&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/13">It punishes the entire family. I was pleased that my hon. Friend the Minister told the House that he would reflect on the issue. I hope that he will do so in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/14">On schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act 2000, I was pleased to hear the Minister make some commitments, having looked at David Anderson&#8217;s recommendations. That will take us forward. I am pleased that the Government saw the problem with the existing legislation before it became a massive media story. However, the Government can go a lot further. I have tried to itemise a series of amendments that would make a substantial difference. The time has already been reduced from nine hours to six. However, we should go further. We should get rid of the idea of holding people without reasonable suspicion.</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/15">One thing we do know is that, with all the people who have been convicted after being held, there has been intelligence ahead of that. I am told that not on a single occasion has someone been stopped and searched, effectively randomly, without suspicion, and been convicted. Therefore, if it is not working, we do not need it to be sure that we are convicting people. There is a series of processes&#8212;the right to silence, the right to a lawyer&#8212;which should be taken further in another place.</p>
	<p pid="b.697.2/16">I am pleased that the Government have shown throughout the passage of the Bill, from pre-legislative scrutiny to now, that they are listening and will reflect. I hope that that will continue in the other place and that this can be the right sort of Bill that helps us to deal with the genuine problem of antisocial behaviour, but also protects, indeed enhances, civil liberties by retreating from some of the things that the previous Government introduced&#8212;antisocial behaviour orders, schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act and much more.</p>

	<p pid="b.699.0/1">I do not wish to detain the House for any great period. I had the great privilege and honour of serving on the Bill Committee with my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40483" name="Robert Syms">the Member for Poole (Mr Syms)</phrase>, who was not always given an easy time by those whom he was whipping, even on his own Benches. As a number of hon. Members have done, I pay tribute to the proceedings in the Bill Committee. It was a great pleasure of course to work with <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40199" name="David Hanson">the right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson)</phrase> and with the Minister for Policing and Criminal Justice and <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40600" name="Jeremy Browne">the hon. Member for Taunton Deane (Mr Browne)</phrase>, who was also taking the Bill through the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.699.0/2">The Bill has shown the House at its best. It has been improved throughout the Bill Committee, both by Opposition amendments that the Government have taken on board&#8212;they have brought changes to the Bill before the House during Report&#8212;and amendments tabled by Government Back Benchers, which the Government have also taken into account. I want to pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40159" name="Tracey Crouch">the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch)</phrase> for her work during the passage of the Bill, which a number of us were pleased to support and which has led to the vast improvement of the Bill before it leaves this place.</p>
	<p pid="b.699.0/3">I am grateful to the right hon. Member for Delyn for indicating he will not divide the House on Third Reading, but insofar as there is any difference between the two sides of the House on the Bill, it appears principally to centre on whether ASBOs have been a good thing. I understand that there is politics around this and the Labour party is deeply attached to the idea, but as I pointed out in our debate yesterday, whether or not ASBOs were originally effective, as matters now stand they have turned out not to be effective at all. As <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the hon. Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase> has pointed out, they have become a badge of honour for some teenagers, and the breach rates of ASBOs among teenagers in particular have risen to such levels that they have proved completely ineffective at controlling antisocial behaviour. It is therefore entirely right that the Government have moved to tackle this issue&#8212;as, I say to the right hon. Member for Delyn, I suspect that that would have been the position even if his party were in government.</p>

	<p pid="b.699.1/1">We had to wait and wait impatiently for years for the Labour party to introduce ASBOs in Northern Ireland, and we were very grateful indeed when we had them extended to Northern Ireland and we have found them very effective.</p>

	<p pid="b.699.2/1">I hear what the hon. Lady says, but the breach rates among teenagers have in some places reached as high as 90% and in those circumstances it is</p>
	<p pid="b.699.2/2">absolutely plain, at least in England and Wales, that ASBOs are not working to control antisocial behaviour. The poll to which I referred yesterday and to which the hon. Member for Cambridge has referred today found that the vast majority of people in this country do not see ASBOs as an effective way of tackling antisocial behaviour. The position in Northern Ireland may be different, but the reality is that whichever party was in government, this issue had to be grappled with. I am pleased the Government have done so and have brought forward measures to deal with antisocial behaviour that are largely welcome on both sides of the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.699.2/3">As the Bill leaves the House, there are great sadnesses. One of them is that we are yet to have a proper debate on the extradition provisions. We have had the Scott Baker report, yet that has never been debated at length in this House. My hon. Friends the Members for Enfield North (Nick de Bois) and for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab) have repeatedly sought to have a proper debate on extradition, and it remains a matter of great sadness to me&#8212;and, I know, a number of other colleagues&#8212;that we have not yet had that debate. I therefore hope that, as this Bill leaves the House with these effectively undebated provisions relating to extradition, they will receive a great deal of scrutiny in the other place.</p>
	<p pid="b.699.2/4">When my right hon. Friend the Minister opened the Third Reading debate he pointed out that one of the things this Bill will do is put the victim at the absolute heart of tackling antisocial behaviour. That is greatly to be welcomed. I had some concerns about the way in which community remedies were going to be dealt with in the Bill, but the Government have listened to the concerns I and a number of others had around how those provisions were to be interpreted and whether or not guidance should be given. That is one of the ways in which the Bill has been improved, and it serves to show this House in its best light.</p>
	<p pid="b.699.2/5">The Government have listened and brought forward measures designed to improve the Bill, so that when it is rolled out across the country, it tackles the things it is designed to tackle. I have paid a number of tributes already, but may I pay a final one? It is fair to say that the officials at the Home Office and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs were given a great deal of work to do by the Bill Committee during the passage of this Bill, and I am sure that my right hon. Friend the Minister would wish to join me in congratulating them on all the work they did. As this Bill goes to the other place for further consideration, I can say that, in its drafting and the way in which it has been improved, it is, in my short tenure in this House, one of the best Bills the House has considered.</p>
	<p pid="b.699.2/6" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>

	Deep Sea Mining Bill (Ways and Means)
</minor-heading>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.701.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40224" speakername="Hugo Swire" speakeroffice="The Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office"  colnum="701"  time="017:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0004.htm#131015-0004.htm_spmin0">
	<p pid="b.701.1/1" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">I beg to move,</p>
	<p pid="b.701.1/2" class="" pwmotiontext="yes">That, for the purposes of any Act resulting from the Deep Sea Mining Bill, it is expedient to authorise:</p>
	<p pid="b.701.1/3">(1) the imposition of charges in connection with licences granted as a result of the Act, and</p>
	<p pid="b.701.1/4">(2) the payment of sums into the Consolidated Fund.</p>
	<p pid="b.701.1/5">The House debated the Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2013-09-06">Friday 6 September</phrase> and it received its Second Reading unopposed. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40546" name="Sheryll Murray">the Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray)</phrase> for her work on the Bill thus far and to Members from across the House who took part in the debate. The former Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40435" name="Alistair Burt">the Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt)</phrase>, signalled the Government&#8217;s support for the Bill on Second Reading, and in order for the Bill to progress to Committee it is necessary for a Ways and Means resolution to be agreed by the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.701.1/6">As I have said, this motion allows for charges to be imposed in connection with licences granted as a result of the Act. Under the Act, licences would be granted for the exploration or exploitation of any of the certain mineral types for which the International Seabed Authority has regulations&#8212;currently, those are polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides and ferromanganese cobalt-rich crusts. The licence would be specific to a particular area of the deep sea bed and it would not have effect until the ISA issued a corresponding contract to the same applicant. The application fee for an exploration licence currently stands at &#163;10,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.701.2/1">Have mining companies expressed any interest in exploiting the deep sea bed around the coast of Northern Ireland? The Bill extends to Northern Ireland but not to Scotland, as is helpfully explained in the explanatory notes.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.701.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40224" speakername="Hugo Swire" colnum="701"  time="017:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0004.htm#131015-0004.htm_spnew8">
	<p pid="b.701.3/1">I am not aware that there has been any such interest, but, as the hon. Lady says, the new licensing regime applies to Northern Ireland as much as it does to anywhere else. Of course, all this motion is doing is committing the Bill to Committee, where she will have a chance to use her forensic powers of examination to tease that and other information out.</p>
	<p pid="b.701.3/2">As I was saying, the application fee for an exploration licence stands at &#163;10,000. The company then pays an annual fee for three years to continue to hold the licence; those fees are &#163;15,000 for the first year, &#163;25,000 for the second year and &#163;25,000 for the third year. Those are substantial sums; indeed the fee for an application to the ISA is $500,000. Those involved are not small-scale companies but businesses that are prepared to make significant investments in the search for minerals on the deep sea bed. Two licences have been issued under the Deep Sea Mining (Temporary Provisions) Act 1981, and should this Bill become law we hope it will encourage other companies to apply. The fees go into the Consolidated Fund. The ability of the UK Government to issue these licences, in a manner that is fully compliant with international law, will ensure that British companies benefit from the opportunities available in this new industry. The country as a whole will benefit, too.</p>

	<p pid="b.702.0/1">I was particularly struck by the Minister&#8217;s phrase that the Bill will benefit &#8220;British companies&#8221; and allow them to exploit the deep sea bed. The Bill runs to only two clauses, but does it contain a clause that I have not noticed which reduces those who can mine the deep sea bed around England, Wales and Northern Ireland&#8212;but not Scotland&#8212;to British companies only?</p>

	<p pid="b.705.2/1">I am extremely grateful to the Conservative party. Because of the social event that Conservative Members are attending tonight, it managed to engineer a little under two hours for me to make the important points that I wish to make, which is just about adequate time.</p>
	<p pid="b.705.2/2">We have a Government who are Janus-faced on a vital issue. I had the pleasure last Thursday of listening to the new the Minister of State, Cabinet Office, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40617" name="Greg Clark">the right hon. Member for Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark)</phrase>, talking about his view of the principle of devolution. He is the one that is facing forward, but I believe there is another face to this Janus. Lurking in the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office is a little nest of devolution deniers who are doing great damage.</p>
	<p pid="b.705.2/3">The Minister of State said last week:</p>
	<p pid="b.705.2/4">&#8220;This has been something that, as you know, I have always been passionate about. Way back in Opposition, I wrote books on the need to transfer power from the centre to the places in our country. As you probably know, I am Middlesbrough born and bred, and the founders of the infant Hercules did not need to ask permission from central government to grow and prosper. I think we need to get back to the spirit of people, the leaders of our cities, towns and counties across the country, feeling that they have the right to initiate policies, do things differently, and have greater control of financial resources.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.705.2/5">Hallelujah. Amen to that.</p>
	<p pid="b.705.2/6">But what has happened in Wales has been extraordinary. We have seen the other face of Janus that is looking backwards. That is where the devolution denial is coming from. The Attorney-General&#8217;s Office is suffering from an acute case of CPR&#8212;it is chronically power retentive in an era of devolution. This is not something that has come about as party propaganda. We have had votes on this. We have been through the whole process. We had a referendum to get devolution in Wales and we had a referendum to get greater powers.</p>
	<p pid="b.705.2/7">I speak with some pedigree on this because I can fondly recall the day in 1953 when I marched through Cardiff with people from several parties. I had a Labour party banner that said &#8220;Senedd i Gymru&#8221;, &#8220;a Parliament for Wales&#8221;. It did not say, &#8220;hanner Senedd i Gymru&#8221;. It did not say, &#8220;LCOs i&#8217;r bobl&#8221;. It did not say, &#8220;half-baked policies that can be shredded by a national Government.&#8221; It said, &#8220;a Parliament for Wales&#8221;. We still do not have one, sadly. We have a form of democracy, but it is not tax-raising and the limited powers that it has for passing laws have been frustrated at every turn.</p>

	<p pid="b.705.4/2">Member for Cardiff, Central today. At that time it meant challenging some of the views of the Labour party in Wales, which were not always progressive.</p>
	<p pid="b.705.4/3">We got to the stage where Wales had the chance to make laws on its own soil, not for the first time in history, but for the first time in 1,000 years. Laws were made by Hywel Dda between 942 and 950, and they were very progressive. One stated that if a wife caught her husband in bed with another woman for the third time, she could divorce him and get compensation for the previous two occasions. Women had the right to own land, which was progressive in 942. There was also a law&#8212;it is rather better than the bedroom tax and other measures we have now&#8212;stating that if a person had passed through three villages asking for food but not been fed, he or she could not be punished for stealing food. That was progressive Welsh legislation, and it should have inspired the Government to realise that, as the great Welsh proverb states: Hawdd cynnau t&#226;n ar hen aelwyd&#8212;it is easy to kindle a fire on an old hearth. The old hearth was there, because we were law-makers in the past, and good law-makers at that.</p>
	<p pid="b.705.4/4">Boldly the Welsh Assembly Government put forward their first law, which had the romantic title of the Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Bill. They took it through the Assembly and it became an Act. One would not have expected it to cause an enormous amount of excitement, because it just cleared up a few other laws to allow local government to pass their own byelaws, which they have been doing without trouble for a long time. There was no hesitation and no excitement, but for some reason&#8212;I am sure that the Solicitor-General will explain it when he replies&#8212;that modest Bill, the first for 1,000 years to bear the royal Welsh seal, which made it significant, even if its content was not, was opposed by the Attorney-General&#8217;s office.</p>

	<p pid="b.706.0/1">My hon. Friend might want to recollect that before that we had the procedure for legislative competence orders, which he has referred to. The first one I dealt with, along with my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40414" name="Peter Hain">the Member for Neath (Mr Hain)</phrase>, was the LCO on red meat. Although it was delayed, subject to parliamentary scrutiny that was a little over-onerous, we did not delay the red meat LCO too long, because otherwise it would have gone off.</p>

	<p pid="b.706.1/1">Yes, it was a difficult period when we had the LCOs, which were a new legislative monstrosity that we were stuck with and that puzzled us, but as a result of certain ingenuity they did mean that some sort of law was made in Wales, even if in a cack-handed manner. They are now a footnote in history.</p>
	<p pid="b.706.1/2">The Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Bill went through because it was uncontroversial, and there was a little bit of ceremony because we were proud to be making laws in the land of our own country for the first time in more than 1,000 years. Why on earth was it opposed? The First Minister called it a</p>
	<p pid="b.706.1/3">&#8220;ridiculous situation that has arisen on what is a totally uncontroversial piece of legislation&#8230;The primary policy objective of the Bill is to simplify and rationalise how local authorities make byelaws to deal with nuisances in their areas&#8230;So why the UK government has decided to take this to the Supreme Court, at the last minute, is inexplicable.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.707.0/1">My hon. Friend is making a strong case about the first law, which was very historic, as he mentioned. Did he share my surprise, along with other members of the Welsh Affairs Committee, that the Secretary of State, and apparently the Attorney-General&#8217;s office, did not even seem aware of the cost to the taxpayer of referring that very modest measure to the Supreme Court?</p>

	<p pid="b.707.1/1">I am glad that my hon. Friend has intervened, because I can remind him of the costs that the Government seemed indifferent to. The legal cost of the Treasury Solicitor&#8217;s Department for representing the Attorney-General in relation to the Bill was &#163;59,000.</p>

	<p pid="b.707.3/1">Absolutely. We could have saved lots of the bedroom tax if this had not been done. The legal cost incurred by the Welsh Government was &#163;30,000, and about &#163;15,000 was spent on civil service time in the Wales Office. The total bill was &#163;150,000. Why? Because some pernickety piffle artist in the Attorney-General&#8217;s office was trying to make some kind of stand against devolution. He went through the might of the High Court. Five judges were there, looking dignified and wise in their wigs. The total number of judges who agreed with the Government was zero. It was a unanimous vote that this was a frivolous intervention.</p>

	<p pid="b.707.4/1">While following the very excited way in which the hon. Gentleman is putting his case, I cannot let him get him get away with that, because the Court made it clear that it was a perfectly justifiable application, and in fact it clarified the law in an important way.</p>

	<p pid="b.707.6/1">I am not sure that it is entirely fair for my hon. Friend to put all the blame on officials in the Attorney-General&#8217;s office in the way that he graphically described, because it was the Secretary of State in the Wales Office who referred the matter to the Attorney-General. As the then Secretary of State, I was the author of the Government of Wales Act 2006, under which this process took place. I can tell my hon. Friend, and the House, that in no way was that Act drafted and designed to allow for this situation to occur. The drafting of the relevant clause dealt with cross-border issues where there were questions, for example, about rivers that flowed across the border or other environmental concerns about which there might be disputes after a Wales Act had been passed by the UK Government in Westminster. There needed to be a reserve power by which the Secretary of State for Wales could clarify or tidy up anything that resulted from such a cross-border issue. It was never intended to allow the Secretary of State to ride roughshod over the devolution settlement and veto what the Welsh Assembly had decided.</p>

	<p pid="b.708.0/1">Before my hon. Friend continues on to another Bill, may I suggest that there might be an interpretation of what justified the Westminster intervention and challenge on this? It is as simple as this: for local government, a devolved area in Wales, read England.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2013-10-15b.708.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40424" speakername="Paul Flynn" colnum="708"  time="017:35:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0004.htm#131015-0004.htm_spnew34">
	<p pid="b.708.1/1">Absolutely. This is part of the long history of the neglect of Wales and the undervaluing of Welsh life by the British Government over the years that now has a chance of being corrected.</p>
	<p pid="b.708.1/2">A Bill about the Welsh language was proposed that offered equal status to the two languages. While there were quibbles from the national Government about this, they did not take it to the High Court. We now have a farm workers wages Bill&#8212;a splendid Bill in many ways&#8212;that has had great support even from the farm unions in Wales. That is because there are farm wages boards in Scotland and in Northern Ireland, and the Bill tried to get the board continued in Wales. Farm workers along the borders in Wales are already exposed to market forces and do not have the protection that the 13,000 farm workers in Wales have. The Agricultural Wages Board set pay rates that gave a modest amount of protection to farm workers, whose wages have never been generous and were hardly generous under the Bill, but are certainly exposed to greater cuts now.</p>
	<p pid="b.708.1/3">The UK Government warned that there were important questions for the Supreme Court to resolve as to whether the Assembly acted within its powers on that matter. Yet whatever powers the Welsh Assembly got, they certainly included agriculture. There is no question about that, because it was the decision of this House under the Acts that were passed here. However, for some twisted reason the Government decided that this was to do with employment, and by that chicanery challenged the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="b.708.2/1">Does my hon. Friend share my shock at the fact that the Welsh Government Minister, Alun Davies, had repeatedly made it clear to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs that he wanted to carve a different path in Wales and was simply seeking a dispensation in order to do that, and yet he was told, &#8220;No, we will abolish the whole structure of the Agricultural Wages Board and then fight the battle over whether you can reinstate something that looks like it&#8221;? What sort of respect for devolution is that?</p>

	<p pid="b.708.3/1">My hon. Friend gives a splendid example. This is the reverse of devolution, the very opposite of what the new Minister of State at the Cabinet Office said the other day about local opinion and good ideas. Wales has a stronger case for an Agricultural Wages Board, perhaps, than many parts of England, so we should be able to make a different decision, but the Government object.</p>

	<p pid="b.708.4/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing the debate. Should it not be the case&#8212;it certainly was when I was Welsh Secretary&#8212;that disputes between devolved Administrations and the United Kingdom Government should be resolved at a governmental and political level, and that they should never get to a stage where they are resolved by the courts?</p>

	<p pid="b.709.0/1">That is absolutely right. Leaving decisions to the courts and depending on expensive silks is no way to run devolved Assemblies or national Governments.</p>
	<p pid="b.709.0/2">A Bill on recovering NHS costs for asbestos treatment is also of great value. It went through the Assembly over the summer and is at an advanced stage. The first people to have their lives destroyed by negligent employers, or by defects in the health service with which they were provided, have suffered&#8212;it is a terrible, crippling disease&#8212;and they will be entitled to compensation from those who were responsible for causing the problem. What is wrong with that? The Bill has not been finally resolved, but if there is a problem with such Bills, surely the two authorities should discuss and resolve it.</p>

	<p pid="b.709.1/1">Does my hon. Friend agree that that Bill is important because it will recover money for the health service, which is a very worthwhile thing to do? One would have thought there would be support for that across the whole of the UK.</p>

	<p pid="b.709.2/1">That is absolutely right. The main part of the Bill is to get money back for the health service from the negligent people who allowed diseases to take hold. Many of the unfortunate people affected by asbestosis in Wales worked in industry.</p>
	<p pid="b.709.2/2">Tied to all this is the Government&#8217;s view of devolution. The Silk commission reported after a referendum that measured popular opinion in Wales. We know that the Tories have always had trouble with devolution. They were very much against it in 1994 when, as my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40414" name="Peter Hain">the Member for Neath (Mr Hain)</phrase> has said, three of us were disciplined by the Labour party in Wales.

	<p pid="b.709.3/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend on securing this debate. We are still awaiting the latest information on the findings of the Silk commission. Devolution delivers the things we need for the people of Wales&#8212;Welsh solutions to Welsh problems&#8212;and yet we cannot seem to prise that information out of the Government. It is a great shame that we cannot make progress at the pace that the communities and citizens of Wales want when we are putting all this time and effort into good governance.</p>

	<p pid="b.709.4/1">My hon. Friend expresses very well the position we are in now. The Silk commission, after an exhaustive inquiry, made certain recommendations. We were promised that the Government would reply in the spring, then the summer, then the late summer and then the early autumn, but when will they actually respond? Carwyn Jones rightly said over the weekend that this is a major problem. An urgent bypass is required in Gwent and other constituencies that suffer continual traffic congestion, such as that of my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40612" name="Paul Murphy">the Member for Torfaen (Paul Murphy)</phrase>, in order to find an alternative route for the M4. As Carwyn Jones said, the situation is frozen. The Welsh Government cannot move forward until there is a response to the Silk commission and action is taken on that.</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/2">In a few weeks&#8217; time, on <phrase class="date" code="2013-11-04">4 November</phrase>, Newport will recall the great day when thousands of Chartists made their protest against the Government of the time. They</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/3">intended to establish a republic. The plan was to stop the mail going from Newport&#8212;that is the Royal Mail, not the</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/4" class="italic">Daily Mail</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/5">, although there may well be riots about that now&#8212;so that the signal would go to the rest of the country that a revolution was going on and that a republic was to be set up. It was very good of Her Majesty to organise a party tonight to give me enough time to explain what happened. Those people wanted to run their own affairs and to have autonomy 174 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/6">I will conclude, because I am sure that my hon. Friends will want to contribute to the debate, by reading a poem about that march in 1839 by Gillian Clarke, who concludes by saying that the &#8220;grudged gift&#8221; of devolution was given sparingly:</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/7">&#8220;Their bones ached from the shift, wind in the shaft,</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/8">the heat of the furnaces, yet on they marched,</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/9">their minds a blaze because their cause was right,</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/10">through darkness from Ebbw Vale, Blackwood, Pontypool,</p>
	<p pid="b.709.4/11">faces frozen and stung by the lash of rain,</p>

	<p pid="b.709.4/16">To stand united, of one heart in the square</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40612" name="Paul Murphy">the Member for Torfaen (Paul Murphy)</phrase> made the key point that we would like to see such discussions resolved politically, rather than being taken through the courts, with the huge costs that that involves.</p>
	<p pid="b.710.0/2">The Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for initiating the action. The sad thing is that in each case, he has acted right at the last minute. Instead of discussing early on whether the Assembly was taking the appropriate measures or proceeding in the right way, on each occasion he has waited until the very last minute, when the Welsh Assembly Government have had everything ready and have been prepared to act, to raise the objection, in an almost obstructive manner. I hesitate to use that word because it might be considered unparliamentary to</p>
	<p pid="b.710.0/3">accuse him of such action, but it really does look as though he acts just when the Welsh Government have an excellent idea.</p>
	<p pid="b.710.0/4">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40465" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> spoke about the preparation that was done to allow the Agricultural Wages Board to remain in Wales. That was not a matter of starting from scratch, but of continuing what was already there. However, that has been laid waste because the legislation was put in question. That is such a wasteful way of proceeding.</p>
	<p pid="b.710.0/5">I would like to ask the Minister a question, to which I hope he will respond when he replies, although I fear it might be difficult for him as Solicitor-General, because he cannot predict what his colleague the Secretary of State for Wales will do. My question is, when will this process end? How many more things will the Welsh Government prepare and be ready to run with, only to find that they are suddenly thwarted? We want that process, and the ridiculous waste of money, to stop now. If there are doubts about what is within the competence of the devolved Government, let us get that sorted out properly, around the table in a grown-up manner, not in the current ridiculous way. It is like children running up to mummy or daddy to ask whether something is right or wrong. It is an absurd situation, and I would like to know whether the Attorney-General has had talks with the Secretary of State for Wales about making this the last time it happens. It should not continue in future.</p>

	<p pid="b.711.0/1">Unexpectedly, I rise to support my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40424" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> on this issue. I do not actually think the Attorney-General&#8217;s Office is to blame for the situation. The system is to blame, because it means that issues are resolved through the courts when they should be resolved through the political process.</p>
	<p pid="b.711.0/2">The whole purpose of the Wales Office and its counterparts in Northern Ireland and Scotland is to resolve disputes such as those that have been described in a proper political way, so that they never have to enter a court of law, let alone end up going to the Supreme Court and costing so much money. When I was first appointed Secretary of State for Wales, virtually all the responsibilities of my predecessors had gone to the National Assembly for Wales. Although my hon. Friend and I&#8212;we have been friends for far too many years to remember&#8212;were not always on the same path on the issue, we have ended up in the same place on it, not least because the people of Wales recently voted to extend the Assembly&#8217;s powers. For the first time, it will have the right to produce its own primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.711.0/3">The Solicitor-General will know that disputes in government are resolved either through correspondence or, if that cannot work, through Ministers meeting. In the case of matters involving devolved Administrations, Ministers of the Crown meet other Ministers of the Crown who happen to be in the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Beyond that, there is machinery, for which I was once responsible, for joint ministerial committees. If necessary, there is British-Irish Council. All that means that matters can be resolved</p>
	<p pid="b.711.0/4">in a way that avoids the need to go to the courts. Of course, the situation is not the same when different parties are in government in London and Cardiff, but the principle is the same&#8212;to try to resolve the problem.</p>
	<p pid="b.711.0/5">I rather fancy that the Solicitor-General will talk about whether the National Assembly has the powers to do certain things and whether it acts ultra vires or intra vires. Even those points can be resolved by diplomatic means, however, if they are talked through. By going to the Supreme Court, we press the nuclear button. Although that might satisfy the lawyers, civil servants and Ministers who think it should be done, they are unwittingly doing immense damage to the devolutionary settlement, whether in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The whole purpose of devolving legislation and administration to those three countries and regions of the United Kingdom is that they are allowed, by Act of Parliament and by referendum, to take their own decisions. If the Government do not like something, a crafty way to stop it is not through negotiation among Ministers but by going to the courts. That is the wrong way to do it.</p>
	<p pid="b.711.0/6">A lot of the problem is the general inexperience in government of how devolution works. For many years, I was frustrated with Whitehall Departments because they did not understand what devolution meant. The purpose of the territorial Departments of State for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is to undertake liaison between the Governments of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland and that of the United Kingdom.</p>

	<p pid="b.712.0/1">My right hon. Friend is making a strong case. Does he agree that at play here was something much more sinister because, in the case of the Agricultural Wages Board, the Welsh Government were going to show up the UK Government in what they were doing and what we were trying to protect? Let us not forget that the measure was to protect more than 13,000 low-paid agricultural workers in Wales. The use of this constitutional process shows not only disrespect for devolution, but a way of trying to get away from something the Government did not want to be shown up in public.</p>

	<p pid="b.712.1/1">There are two ways of looking at it. There are party political differences because of the different parties in the different countries, but I also experienced that when Labour was in government and other state Departments were not necessarily sympathetic to what the Welsh Government were doing. It was my job to say, &#8220;You might not like it, but you&#8217;ve got to do it because that is what devolution is all about.&#8221; Otherwise, what is the point of having it in the first place?</p>

	<p pid="b.712.2/1">When I served under my right hon.

	<p pid="b.712.3/1">I am grateful to my hon.

That has been set up for nearly 16 years and is precisely to deal with those areas of</p>
	<p pid="b.712.3/2">considerable difference. In my view, that includes whether there is a dispute, and whether something is intra vires or ultra vires. I repeat: to take the issue to the courts is to press the nuclear button and could cause immeasurable damage to the devolution settlement.</p>

	<p pid="b.713.0/1">I want to return to the Agricultural Wages Board&#8212;a good example &#8212;and ask the Solicitor-General why he is so adamantly trying to stop the agricultural wages sector in Wales, which is important to us in Wales as a rural economy. I represent the wonderful rural constituency of Swansea East and&#8212;I have to say this&#8212;I have a husband and son who are actively engaged in the rural community. I therefore get my ear bent about this matter on a regular basis by family, friends and neighbours, and I note the concern that people are expressing to me, and the worry. We have already seen the agricultural industry hit. Many people will have far greater fluency on the issue and be more qualified to speak about these matters than I am, but the idea that we in Wales cannot make a decision about helping farmers and rural workers within the boundaries of Wales without having it challenged is a retrograde step in the light of devolution, as many of my colleagues have said.</p>
	<p pid="b.713.0/2">I am worried because the Farmers Union of Wales has stated clearly that this is about attracting young people of high calibre to the agricultural industry. If we want to attract the best young, forward-thinking people, including women, into rural industries and those related to them, how do we do that when we have to fight for every penny? How do we say, possibly when unscrupulous employers are taking advantage of the fact that there is now no Agricultural Wages Board to protect people, &#8220;It&#8217;s okay, we&#8217;ll look after you&#8221;?</p>
	<p pid="b.713.0/3">This is not a race to the bottom; it is supposed to be a race to the top, but I am finding it difficult, and I would like the Solicitor-General to explain the situation to me and to all the people in Wales, including the 13,300 agricultural workers who would be protected by the introduction of the legislation in Wales. They are heaving a huge sigh of relief and are sympathetic to their fellow workers across the border in England. We already have wages boards in Scotland and Northern Ireland, and we cannot see why this legislation was introduced in Westminster.</p>
	<p pid="b.713.0/4">I am going over old ground&#8212;the Minister will have heard this regularly and be well aware of it&#8212;but we want and need that protection in Wales. If we want a thriving rural sector in Wales, we must pay decent wages. We must ensure that we can protect people.</p>
	<p pid="b.713.0/5">As I have said, I have friends in unglamorous jobs in farming&#8212;cow men, shepherds, general farm workers and farriers. They are cross, as hon. Members can imagine. They expect to be protected. They have been successfully protected for 65 years. During that period, many hundreds of thousands of people have been ensured a minimum wage and protection.</p>
	<p pid="b.713.0/6">When <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40545" name="James Paice">the right hon. Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Sir James Paice)</phrase> was a Minister in the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, he suggested that Labour Members assumed that farm workers were &#8220;forelock-tugging yokels&#8221;. All hon. Members accept that the world has moved on since 1948, but protection is not backward looking; it is about the future.</p>
	<p pid="b.713.0/7">Somebody once likened history to using a rear-view mirror in a car: it is useful, but we do not necessarily need it. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40424" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> spoke of history, particularly of the Chartists. We should look over our shoulders and ask why the Agricultural Wages Board was established in the first place and what it has done over the years. I am sorry, but in Wales we would like to plough our own furrow&#8212;pardon my pun.</p>
	<p pid="b.713.0/8">I return to the basic question. The board is supported by farming unions in Wales and other parts of the UK. I ask the Minister to accept that we in Wales want to be forward thinking. We want to protect people and give them decent wages. The Labour Welsh Assembly Government is to be congratulated on their action. They should not be stymied and thwarted at every corner. Let us move forward.</p>

	<p pid="b.714.0/1">I congratulate my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40424" name="Paul Flynn">the Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> not only on introducing the debate and on his excellent peroration on the stymieing of legislation and policy in Wales by the current Westminster Government, but on expounding on the narrative history of the Chartists and why it is relevant. I can only share his disappointment that we have so little time to debate this&#8212;we could go overnight, but, in compliance with the wishes of right hon. and hon. Members, we will try to avoid that situation.</p>
	<p pid="b.714.0/2">The legislative competence order process was a previous mechanism for producing legislation in Wales. It was slightly cumbersome and convoluted, and required a great deal of detailed scrutiny in Parliament. However, it passed some cognisance of the growing authority of the Welsh Government. LCOs were much criticised at the time&#8212;rightly, in some ways, because they caused delay and were complex, even for the very good officials in the Wales Office in London and in Cardiff, and for Welsh Government officials, who worked through the minutiae. The intention&#8212;to afford proper scrutiny in Parliament and ensure that the Welsh Government could introduce their own measures under the process within their clearly devolved responsibilities and so on&#8212;was good. Yes, it caused delays, but there was a good spirit. We managed to pass LCOs into legislation, even after good scrutiny in Parliament by the Welsh Affairs Committee and others. There was never any intention to hold things up unduly.</p>
	<p pid="b.714.0/3">The purpose was the growing relationship under the LCO system between the right scrutiny of this place at that time and the right role of the Welsh people, through their elected officials in the Welsh Assembly and the Welsh Government, to introduce appropriate measures from Wales. As my hon. Friend pointed out, that was not without its difficulties. It could sometimes be tortuous&#8212;even the now legendary red meat LCO took a little time to get on to the books, and that was one of the more straightforward orders&#8212;but we got there eventually. On all occasions, the intention of my right hon. Friends the Members for Neath (Mr Hain) and for Torfaen (Paul Murphy) was for their officials to work with officials in the Welsh Government and the Welsh Assembly to try to progress the measures through the LCO mechanism, which was imperfect but was what we had at the time.</p>
	<p pid="b.714.0/4">What has followed, with the will of the Welsh people, is ostensibly an attempt to streamline the process to give clarity on where devolved responsibilities lie, and to allow the Welsh Government, the Welsh people and Welsh civic society to get on with passing their own laws&#8212;whether we, on both sides of the House, might agree or disagree with them ideologically&#8212;to define their own democratic path. As we have heard, it has not quite gone that way. For those on the Opposition Benches it feels like there has been by the current Secretary of State for Wales&#8212;I do not blame the Solicitor-General for looking quizzical&#8212;a maybe inadvertent but deliberate attempt to hold up, to challenge, to rebuke the Welsh people for being so impertinent as to actually bring forward their own legislation.</p>

	<p pid="b.715.0/1">I am surprised to hear the hon. Gentleman suggest that LCOs are better than the current system, whereby the National Assembly for Wales has primary powers in 20 areas. What is more, most of the Bills are going through without any difficulty. There have been difficulties with two, but the idea that we should go back to LCOs is wrong.</p>

	<p pid="b.715.1/1">I could not agree with the hon. and learned Gentleman more. Perhaps I should clarify what I was saying: LCOs were clearly imperfect, but the new system is meant to be better. Even with the LCO paraphernalia&#8212;it was difficult and cumbersome&#8212;attempts were made within the constitutional arrangement, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Torfaen has made clear, to work through those difficulties. If necessary, and as a last resort, they would be escalated up the constitutional food chain for resolution at a higher level, but there was certainly not the seemingly macho political posturing of taking it outside of this place without recourse to internal mechanisms and straight to the Supreme Court. I can see only one possible justification for that: to prove some sort of point and say to the people of Wales and the democratically elected representatives in Wales, &#8220;Know your place.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.715.2/1">Does my hon. Friend accept that there is also an opportunity cost here? What is the Secretary of State for Wales doing with his and his officials&#8217; time, attempting to stymie and frustrate the will of the Welsh people and the National Assembly instead of focusing on standing up for Wales around the Cabinet table? He was evasive when we questioned him on this point in the Welsh Affairs Committee. He would not give us an estimate of the amount of time that he and his office had spent on this. I suspect it was far more than it should have been.</p>

	<p pid="b.715.3/1">I agree entirely with my hon. Friend. There is a clear case for a cost-benefit analysis of the tasks the Secretary of State is spending his time on, and for asking why he is not finding more useful things to do. There is also the question of the cost of challenging this through the Supreme Court. In an era of what we are told is great austerity, cutbacks and stringent demands on Departments, I am amazed that the Wales Office thinks it fit to throw on to Government&#8212;albeit another Department&#8212;the cost associated with a Supreme Court challenge.</p>
	<p pid="b.715.3/2">I turn to the Agricultural Wages Board, about which I know some small amount, given that I was the shadow Minister who stood here frequently in opposition to its abolition. Just as frequently, I put the case that the Westminster Government merely needed to allow Wales to continue as it was by putting a clause in the Bill, as requested by the Welsh Government, saying, &#8220;Ignore Wales for these purposes.&#8221; We only asked that they let us carry on and find a way to do it ourselves, rather than abolishing the whole mechanism and saying, &#8220;Now do what you want.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.715.3/3">I pay tribute to the work of Unite, in Wales and throughout the UK, which stood up for the lowest of the low-paid agricultural workers, for skills and training and for the development of earnings and capacity among agricultural workers. I also pay tribute to colleagues in the Welsh Assembly, including Mick Antoniw and others, who fought the good fight in Wales and to the Farmers&#8217; Union of Wales&#8212;for goodness&#8217; sake!&#8212;which said, &#8220;The reason we want to keep it in Wales is that we are slightly different from England. We have a higher proportion of small and medium-sized farms, which do not only employ individuals. That is why we want the clarity provided by the Agricultural Wages Board. We also rent ourselves out.&#8221; The would say to me, &#8220;I as a small farmer, rent out, and I know the terms of the contract.&#8221; I am talking of the young farmers of Wales too. These are not organisations that would automatically side with Labour on every issue in defence of something such as the Agricultural Wages Board, but my goodness they did on this occasion.</p>
	<p pid="b.715.3/4">All that the Welsh Government and Alun Davies, the Welsh Minister, were asking was, &#8220;Give us time and space to define our own future&#8221;, but that did not happen. We debated it long and hard, we fought the good fight, speaking up for the Agricultural Wages Board not only in England, but in Wales, all the while conscious that the voice of representatives in the Welsh Government and the National Assembly was not being heard anywhere except in the media. We had to speak for them.</p>
	<p pid="b.715.3/5">Wales lost without having had a direct say, and all that was required was for a Westminster Minister to say, &#8220;We concede that agriculture is a devolved responsibility. We won&#8217;t challenge you. We will put a clause in the Bill that will allow you to proceed.&#8221; That, I say to the Solicitor-General, would have shown respect for Wales and the devolution settlement. Rather than that, and symptomatic of the case put forward by my hon. Friend the Member for Newport West, we had a firm no. The door was shut in our faces. In effect, it wiped Wales off the democratic map. That is a regret.</p>
	<p pid="b.715.3/6">The Solicitor-General is a reasonable and fair-minded fellow. The cacophony of pleas from the Opposition might remind him of the old poem about Welsh people worrying the carcase of a dead song and being a bit too melancholy, but we are not melancholy; we want to be joyous and we want to celebrate devolution and respect the fact that the people of Wales supported greater devolution. We just ask the UK Government, whatever political perspectives make it up, also to show that respect.</p>

	<p pid="b.716.0/1">I start by thanking <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40424" name="Paul Flynn">the hon. Member for Newport West (Paul Flynn)</phrase> for initiating the debate. The issues raised are important</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/2">and go to the heart of the UK&#8217;s devolution arrangements. It is clear that the issues have raised concerns among several hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/3">The hon. Gentleman, in his characteristic way, brought in history and his own political struggle over many years, and it was clear that he would like devolution to go further still. That is his viewpoint. I found the information about the three villages law of 945 particularly interesting, although I am not sure that it would be of current import and could cause some concerns if implemented by the current Government. It is not the Conservative&#8217;s stance on law and order, but it was an interesting piece of context.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/4">The subject of the debate is the role of the Attorney-General in reviewing legislation passed by the National Assembly for Wales&#8212;a role that I share with him. Despite the comments of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40414" name="Peter Hain">the right hon. Member for Neath (Mr Hain)</phrase>, this role was conferred by Parliament on the Attorney-General under the Government of Wales Act 2006. That was, of course, under a Labour Government, with their own approach to the issue of devolution. They had set forward a system of devolution that was a conferred powers model rather than the sort of model used elsewhere in the United Kingdom. As that happened, Parliament recognised that the devolution settlement for Wales must be made to work. The 2006 Act sets out the 20 &#8220;devolved&#8221; subjects in respect of which the National Assembly may legislate. It is the responsibility of this Parliament to legislate in any area that is not devolved.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/5">The 2006 Act provides for the Attorney-General to consider each Bill of the National Assembly, so the Government look carefully at all legislation passed by it to ensure that it falls within the Assembly&#8217;s legislative competence. The Act provides that, where the Attorney-General or I consider a Bill to go beyond the Assembly&#8217;s competence, we can refer it to the Supreme Court to decide the question.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/6">All of that recognises that it is in the nature of legislation that it may often appear to be about more than one thing. Where that happens with legislation passed by the National Assembly, a judgment has to be made about whether the legislation is about something that either is or is not devolved. The Government of Wales Act 2006 provides a means for the Attorney-General and, if necessary, the Supreme Court, to arrive at that judgment. If it did not, the devolution settlement could not work. The same power to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court is conferred on the Counsel General for Wales. In this way, there is an appropriate equality between the UK Government and the Welsh Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/7">That illustrates an important point that I do not want to get lost in the debate. Something has been made of the idea that this Government are anti-devolution or are somehow determined to thwart the will of the Welsh Government and the democratically elected National Assembly for Wales. Where concerns arise, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40612" name="Paul Murphy">the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Paul Murphy)</phrase> said, most are resolved by a process of negotiation between the UK and the Welsh Governments. My officials have excellent working relations with their colleagues in the Wales Office and their opposite numbers in the Counsel General&#8217;s Office. The Attorney-General and I have excellent working relations, as one would expect, with the Secretary of</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/8">State for Wales and with the Counsel General, Theodore Huckle, QC. Together, we are working hard to try to reach agreement.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/9">It was suggested by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40375" name="Nia Griffith">the hon. Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith)</phrase>, the shadow Minister for Wales, that there was a problem with the UK Government making an effort to resolve issues before they escalated to the Supreme Court. It is, however, the last resort. The Wales Office, working with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, has discussed with the Welsh Assembly Government concerns about the Agricultural Sector (Wales) Bill from the outset, and the Secretary of State wrote to the First Minister as soon as the draft Bill was available, expressing concerns about it&#8212;but the Welsh Government could not be persuaded to address them. The mechanisms provided under the Government of Wales Act 2006 will therefore need to be followed. Under its provisions, we are guardians of the Welsh devolution settlement and together we must put our efforts into making it work.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/10">A reference to the Supreme Court is not a confrontational process. It does not amount to this Government or any Government picking a fight with the National Assembly. It is a simple recognition of the fact that a particular piece of Welsh legislation raises difficult devolution questions that are best answered by the independent Supreme Court. That process of resolution is to the benefit of the Welsh Government, the National Assembly and the UK Government. It is in all our interests that we fully and clearly understand the boundaries of the devolution settlement.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/11">Full primary law-making powers are still relatively new for the National Assembly. It was the UK Government and the former Secretary of State, my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40164" name="Cheryl Gillan">the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan)</phrase>, who facilitated the successful referendum in 2011 on the devolution of those powers to the Assembly, allowing it to pass its own laws in 20 devolved areas for the first time. That was a major departure in comparison with a legislative competence order, as it lodged the power squarely with the Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/12">We are still learning about the settlement. Decisions by the Supreme Court about what is within the legislative competence of the Assembly allow us to establish the boundary with greater certainty, and the Supreme Court itself has recognised that when there is uncertainty, it is appropriate for a reference to be made to allow it to be resolved at the earliest possible stage. That was true of the byelaws case.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/13">Having said all that, 1 do not want the House to think that a reference to the Supreme Court is made lightly, or is somehow to be seen as the easy way out. Several Bills have now been passed by the Assembly, and the vast majority are uncontroversial in devolution terms. For the most part, there is consensus with the Welsh Government and the National Assembly that the legislation passed is within competence.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/14">It is clear from this evening&#8217;s debate that the reference of the Agricultural Sector (Wales) Bill has given rise to strong emotions, which were set out by <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40596" name="Sin James">the hon. Member for Swansea East (Mrs James)</phrase>. Given that the reference has been made, I do not think that I should discuss the arguments about, in particular, the competence of that Bill in any detail here. We shall await the Court&#8217;s decision. What I will say is that the reference relates to all the</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/15">themes that I have already identified, and that the United Kingdom Govt take the view that employment law is a UK competence.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/16">The Attorney-General considers that the Agricultural Sector (Wales) Bill raises important questions about the extent of the Assembly&#8217;s legislative competence and the boundary of the devolution settlement. Despite the good working relationships that I have described and the efforts of the UK Government, it was not possible to persuade the Welsh Government that there was a way forward that would meet their concerns. That is why the Supreme Court will have to make the decision. It is a sign of the Government&#8217;s respect for the current devolution arrangements, and our wish to provide certainty and stability for those who work in the agricultural sector, that we are continuing the existing agricultural wages regime in Wales until the court case is decided.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/17">The Government of Wales Act 2006 was introduced by the previous Labour Government. It provided a conferred model for Welsh devolution whereby subjects that were devolved and within the legislative competence of the Assembly were specified in the legislation. The present Government believe that the conferred model is right for Wales. The settlement is not perfect, and the Silk commission&#8212;which has been mentioned&#8212;is currently considering how it could be improved. The Government will respond to Part 1 of the commission&#8217;s recommendations in due course, and, as the House will know, there was a further consultation about stamp duty during the summer. The Government are determined to see the process through, and to make it work.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/18">There is some room in the settlement for different views in certain areas about the extent of the National Assembly&#8217;s legislative competence. That is why the last Labour Government provided a mechanism for the Supreme Court to scrutinise Assembly Bills. However, I agree with the right hon. Member for Torfaen that, if possible, it should be the last resort.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/19">It was this Government who enabled the referendum on full Assembly powers to take place. That is an achievement of which we are proud, and because of it we are seeing a growing and maturing legislature in Wales. That is what devolution is about.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/20"><phrase class="honfriend" id="unknown" name="None">The hon. Member for Newport West mentioned the Asbestos (Recovery of Medical Costs)</phrase> Bill. It is true that there have been constructive discussions about the Bill, but that demonstrates that the UK Government are seeking to resolve the devolution concerns at the earliest possible stage.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/21">I do not think that <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40465" name="Huw Irranca-Davies">the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw Irranca-Davies)</phrase> should be so pessimistic. I realise that to some extent he was making a political case, and it was very nice of him to say how reasonable and fair-minded I am: I have always found him to be the same. However, I think that progress is being made. It is early days, and I believe that this will be seen as a major achievement which is proceeding effectively.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/22" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.716.0/23" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
