	<p pid="b.1162.0/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, we do not call in many applications for consideration. Last year, we called in only about eight. The one he has mentioned has some degree of complexity, and he will understand that I cannot comment about the individual application until all the facts are before me.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.1162.1/1">I strongly support the Minister&#8217;s excellent work in devolving powers to our city regions. Will he assure us that our counties and rural areas such as those in east Hertfordshire will have the same opportunity for these new responsibilities?</p>

	<p pid="b.1162.2/1">Such areas most certainly do have the same opportunity. The devolution of responsibilities and powers to cities has been an important step forward for localism. I should like to see counties, perhaps adjoining counties, and district councils coming together with a united case, because it was that unity of purpose, which was presented to us in various deliberations, that made it easier for us to take powers out of central Government. I am sure that my hon. Friend will be at the forefront in encouraging his local councils to do exactly that.</p>

	<p pid="b.1162.3/1">Last Thursday, I held an Adjournment debate on works that had been carried out by Sainsbury&#8217;s in Belgrave and Leicester, which was efficiently answered by the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40485" name="Penny Mordaunt">the hon.

When will local communities be given the powers to hold developers to account not just for planning applications but when works are being executed, because great delays are being caused by this company?</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40485" name="Penny Mordaunt">the Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt)</phrase>, who is very junior and new to the job, has just briefed me on the situation. As the right hon. Gentleman will understand, the local authority should exercise the powers that it already has in these matters. There is not much point in calling for new powers if the existing ones are not used.</p>

	<p pid="b.1162.5/1">While I agree that the devolution of powers to local authorities can be a good thing, does my right hon. Friend agree that local people should always be consulted before there are any changes to their system of local government?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2014-11-10b.1162.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40116" speakername="Eric Pickles" colnum="1162"  time="14:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmhansrd/cm141110/debtext/141110-0001.htm#141110-0001.htm_spnew10">
	<p pid="b.1162.6/1">Certainly. When new things are to be brought in, I think that it is appropriate to have a consultation and, in some cases, a referendum. The most important thing about localism is that it is about passing powers not only to councils, but to local communities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1162.7/1">In my constituency we are currently campaigning against a planning application for a new drive-through McDonald&#8217;s. I hope that it will be rejected on the normal planning grounds of noise, pollution and so on, but does the Minister think that the local community should also be able to reject such applications when they are very close to local schools?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="b.1163.0/1">Of course, it is very important in that kind of discussion to have a local plan in place, and one would expect a local council to be helpful to the community, and to developers, by setting out clearly where particular developments should take place. I hope that the hon. Lady will forgive me; obviously we will consider that fairly and openly if it comes to us, because the applicant is entitled to justice.</p>

That is one issue I looked at, among others. Most importantly, I also met a number of groups, including women&#8217;s groups, within the fire service. I have trained as a firefighter and I am a serving reservist, so I know the stresses that women go through in order to maintain strength, in particular, in their fitness tests.

Given that their record is an average of just 25,000 affordable homes being built over their four years to date, how will he miraculously deliver a further 75,000 in the Government&#8217;s last remaining year in office?

This will be probably the first Government in my lifetime to leave more affordable homes in stock at the end of a five-year Parliament than there were before it.</p>

That is appalling. Today, I am writing to councils, with the Community Security Trust, to stress the importance of using their range of legal powers to remove such graffiti quickly, including on private property, and to report all incidents to the police.

	<p pid="b.1183.2/1">Last month the previous European Commission presented Britain with a bill for &#163;1.7 billion, which it insisted must be paid by <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>. The Prime Minister spoke for British taxpayers when he said that that was completely unacceptable, and we set about getting a better deal. Following intensive discussions with the new Commission and at the ECOFIN meeting last week, we have achieved such a deal. I can tell the House that we have halved the Bill, have delayed the Bill, will pay no interest on the Bill, and have changed the rules of the European Union so that such unacceptable behaviour never happens again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183.2/2">Let me briefly give the House the details. At the European Council last month, the Prime Minister made it clear to the Barroso Commission that while annual adjustments to contributions were a regular part of EU membership, a sudden and unprecedented demand for a &#163;1.7 billion payment on <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase> was unacceptable. He secured the agreement of all 28 Heads of Government that it should be discussed by the Finance Ministers as a matter of urgency. That meeting took place last Friday, and followed two weeks of intensive and constructive discussions with the new Budget Commissioner, Vice-President Georgieva, and other member states.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183.2/3">As a result of those discussions, we achieved unanimous agreement that, first, expecting payment on <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase> was indeed unacceptable. The budget rules will therefore be rewritten to allow for a delay in any payment. In Britain&#8217;s case, that means that we will pay nothing this year, and will instead make payments in two instalments in July and September, in the second half of next year. Secondly, the suggestion that we might have to pay interest charges was rejected, and it was agreed unanimously that no interest would be charged on the delayed payments. Thirdly, in our discussion with the new European Commission, it was agreed that a full rebate would apply to the British payment, that the rebate would be specific, that it would be in addition to any other rebate that we might expect next year, and that, for the first time ever, it would be paid at the same time as any money owed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183.2/4">It had not been not clear that we would receive a rebate, let alone such a large one. No one in the House had suggested that we would. Only my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40541" name="Andrew Lansley">the Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr Lansley)</phrase> had even asked a question about it. Indeed, it was only confirmed that we would receive a rebate, and a large one, by Vice-President Georgieva on <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-06">6 November</phrase>, last Thursday evening. This means that Britain&#8217;s payments have been halved, from &#163;1.7 billion to about &#163;850 million.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183.2/5">Finally, all member states agreed with us that the entire episode had been unacceptable, and a deal was therefore reached to make a permanent change in European law so that this would never happen again.</p>
	<p pid="b.1183.2/6">In the face of this budget challenge, we have far exceeded the expectations and predictions that preceded Friday&#8217;s meeting. We have achieved a real result for</p>
	<p pid="b.1183.2/7">Britain. The whole episode reminds us of the reform that we need in Europe&#8212;reform that Government Members believe should be put to a vote of the people of Britain.</p>

	<p pid="b.1184.0/1">If this is such a good deal, why did the Chancellor not offer to make a statement? Why was he dragged to the House this afternoon? Talk about smoke and mirrors, Mr Speaker&#8212;I can barely see you through the Chancellor&#8217;s fog and bluster!</p>
	<p pid="b.1184.0/2">Is not the truth that the Chancellor failed to reduce our contribution by a single penny?

His so-called victory is nothing more than a con trick.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184.0/3">The Chancellor claims that the rebate was somehow in doubt, but that claim has been contradicted by everyone else.

	<p pid="b.1184.2/11">They are queuing up to contradict the Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1184.2/12">Let me ask the Chancellor this: can he name a single Finance Minister who is willing to go along with his desperate attempts to pull the wool over people&#8217;s eyes? And it is worse. The <i>Financial Times </i>reported:</p>
	<p pid="b.1184.2/13">&#8220;Officials involved in the closed-door negotiations between finance ministers said Mr Osborne did not complain about the overall bill.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.1184.2/15">Is it not now clear that the Chancellor totally failed to get a better deal for the taxpayer? He did not reduce Britain&#8217;s backdated bill by a single penny. The British people don&#8217;t like being taken for fools, and his attempts to fool them have totally unravelled.</p>

	<p pid="b.1185.0/1">No, the British people do not like being taken for fools which is why the shadow Chancellor is in opposition. The shadow Chancellor is one of those people who is wise neither after the event nor before the event. How do we know that? Because he wrote an article in <i>The Guardian </i>last Friday. It appeared alongside another article called &#8220;Labour is doomed&#8221; by one of his colleagues, and in his article he set out four tests that I had to pass. The first test, he said, was that we needed a coalition of support, and he asked me about that again today. We had unanimous support around the ECOFIN table for the deal that was agreed. The second test he set me before the ECOFIN council was that we needed the support of Germany. Well, we went to Berlin and the German Finance Minister was central to the deal that we did. Thirdly, in this article, he said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.0/2">&#8220;The Prime Minister should be clear about whether he intends to take the EU Commission to the European Court of Justice if they insist on the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.0/3">Well, we do not have a deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase> any more, because we did not challenge the law; we changed the law.</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.0/4">So three tests passed, and here is the fourth and final test the shadow Chancellor set us: he said that the interest rates on any delayed payments should be fair. Well, I disagree. I do not think we should pay any interest at all, and we are not, but what is revealing about this fourth test is the number he himself gave for the fines Britain might face. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.0/5">&#8220;Britain could face a&#8230;fine of &#163;114,000 a day.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.0/6">Does he confirm that that is what he said in the article: &#163;114,000 a day? <i>[Interruption.] </i>Well, he has given himself away because &#163;114,000 a day happens to be the EU penal interest on &#163;1.7 billion, so the shadow Chancellor, who stands before us today and says he always knew the rebate would apply, is the same shadow Chancellor who on Friday said we would paying &#163;1.7 billion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1185.0/7">And of course the word &#8220;rebate&#8221; never appeared once in that article or, indeed, in any intervention from the Labour party on this issue. This whole question from the shadow Chancellor today is based on the absurd charade that he would stand up for Britain&#8217;s interests in Europe, but he gave away billions of pounds of the rebate, he signed us up to billions of pounds of eurozone bail-out, and he still refuses to give the British people a say on our future in Europe. May I suggest to him that he should leave the strong leadership in Europe to us, and he should get on with throwing over the weak leadership in the Labour party?</p>

The calculation on interest payments that he used in <i>The Guardian </i>on Friday was based on the assumption that we would pay &#163;1.7 billion&#8212;that is how he came up with the number that he used to make his point.

Does he also agree that, however distasteful we might find it, while we are in a club we have to abide by the rules, and that only a future Conservative Government will give the people a say&#8212;and a chance to leave the club&#8212;in a referendum in 2017?</p>

He is absolutely right that the only way to get that reform is with a Conservative Government, and then the British people can decide in a referendum.</p>

	<p pid="b.1199.1/1">Before we come to the main business, I have a statement to make on the handling of it. Several hon. and right hon. Members have asked me to rule on the scope of each of the two motions today relating to the protocol 36 opt-in regulations. It might be of assistance to Members intending to take part in the debates if I do so now. On the business of the House motion, any debate should focus on the time to be allocated to the subsequent debate and the putting of the question at its conclusion. Members will have to exercise some ingenuity if they wish to raise other matters, such as the absence of an opportunity for the House to express an opinion or to vote on all or any of the related matters not contained in the regulations. Such remarks must demonstrate a reasonable connection with the business of the House proposition before the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1199.1/2">On the substantive motion to approve the regulations, which I understand transpose into UK law 10 of the 35 measures the Government have decided that the UK should rejoin, I will be prepared to offer some latitude in permitting reference to the merits or otherwise of rejoining those related measures not requiring transposition and therefore not in the regulations, as listed in the Government&#8217;s explanatory memorandum on the regulations. I ask hon. and right hon. Members to lighten the burden on the Chair by holding in their minds the actual question before the House. The Chair and the House can deal only with what is on the Order Paper.</p>

Although I accept your ruling on the technical meaning of the vote at the end, will you allow a broad interpretation of what is relevant to the debate, because at the root of it is the competence of the EU in these issues and the use that is made in this country of the 35 measures that the Government are seeking to opt into?</p>

Is it not right that debates are, on most days, in the hands of the Government? They are perfectly capable of putting down clear motions that people will understand. If they want a vote on the arrest warrant, they can have one. Does this not seem to you, as it does to me, to be procedural prestidigitation to persuade people that they are voting on something on which they are not really voting? Would it not be better if the Government were to put down a clear motion on some future day that we could vote on properly?</p>

	<p pid="b.1202.3/1">I say to the hon. Gentleman that all sorts of things might be better, as he puts it, but as I said in my statement, the Chair and the House can deal only with what is on the Order Paper. I understand, because it has been communicated to me by several Members, that there is considerable irritation on this matter. I absolutely understand that, but what I am trying to do, operating within the limits of the powers of the Chair, is to facilitate the will of the House. I have only a partial ability to do that&#8212;I cannot create a vote for which provision has not been made&#8212;but the House will want to debate what the House wants to debate. In future, it would be better if these matters were handled in a way that is straightforward, and if the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s appetite for the honouring of commitments were to be met.</p>

	<p pid="b.1203.2/1">All we can do today is have a debate, and after that debate Members will have either to vote for or against the regulations or decide to abstain upon them. What motions might or might not be put forward on a subsequent occasion, either to satisfy Members&#8217; appetite or for the purposes of the clarity that the hon.

	<p pid="b.1203.2/2">I think I have given a fairly clear indication that this has been a rather sorry saga and that the House should not be put in this position. Most of us think that a commitment made is a commitment that should be honoured, and we should try to operate according to sensible standards rather than trying to slip things through by some sort of artifice. It may be the sort of thing that some people think is very clever, but people outside the House expect straightforward dealing, and they are frankly contemptuous&#8212;I use the word advisedly &#8212;of what is not straight dealing.

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40627" name="David Winnick">the Member for Walsall North (Mr Winnick)</phrase> suggested we suspend the sitting to allow the House to come back with a more sensible business motion. We will happily suspend the House. It would allow the Justice Secretary to go for his dinner and come back again, and we could then vote later on a more sensible measure.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/2">The Justice Secretary stood there and I heard him say that this was a vote on the whole package of 35 measures. That is in direct contradiction to your ruling and your advice to this House, Mr Speaker. We were told that the business motion today would give us a proper debate. The Whips are scuttling away to try to do some quick dealing to sort out the mess and chaos that the Home Secretary has left the House in today. This was supposed to be a proper debate on the European arrest warrant&#8212;the motion will allow no such thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/3">The Home Secretary told me, in a letter I received this weekend, that</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/4">&#8220;Monday&#8217;s vote is a vote on the entire package of 35 measures &#8230;and in this case a whole day is being made available for the debate rather than the usual 90 minutes.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/5">The whole reason for this business motion, and the whole reason we have the suspension of Standing Orders and the extra time for the debate, is because the Home Secretary told us that this would be a debate on 35 measures, including the European arrest warrant. That is what this business motion is supposed to achieve, but it is a joke. Instead, we have a vote on 11 regulations&#8212;regulations we support and will vote for&#8212;that do not include the European arrest warrant. This is what the motion states:</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/6">&#8220;That the draft Criminal Justice and Data Protection (Protocol No. 36) Regulations 2014&#8230;be approved.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/7">What do the draft regulations say? Not the 35 measures the Government want to opt back into; just 11 good sensible measures, none of which is the European arrest warrant. We have today a business motion on a false premise. This is what the Committee Chairs have said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/8">&#8220;The motion to be considered by the House of Commons concerns a Statutory Instrument&#8230;which is only intended to complete the implementation, in UK law, of 10 of the 35 measures the Government proposes to rejoin. It has no direct relevance to the European Arrest Warrant, the most contentious of the 35 measures, or to UK participation in EU Agencies such as Europol or Eurojust.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/9">That is what they said at the end of last week. That is why I wrote to the Home Secretary at the end of last week to ask her to clarify the matter for the House. That is why she then wrote to me and said that this included the whole package of 35 measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/10">The Prime Minister promised us a vote, and that is what the business motion should achieve. The Leader of the Opposition asked him:</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/11">&#8220;A vital tool&#8230;is the European arrest warrant. Why is the Prime Minister delaying having a vote on it?&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/12">The Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/13">&#8220;I am not delaying having a vote on it. There will be a vote on it.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/14">The Leader of the Opposition offered our help. He said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/15">&#8220;We will give him the time for a vote on the European arrest warrant, and we will help him to get it through.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/16">The Prime Minister said again,</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/17">&#8220;we are going to have a vote, we are going to have it before the Rochester by-election&#8221;.&#8212;&#8212;[<phrase class="offrep" id="debates/2014-10-29.301"><i>Official Report</i>, 29 October 2014; Vol. 587, c. 301</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/18">So where is it? Instead, the Home Secretary forgot to put it in the motion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/19">Why does the Home Secretary want to play into the hands of those who might challenge the European arrest warrant in the courts by not having a straightforward vote? Why not just put the three words &#8220;European arrest warrant&#8221; on the Order Paper and allow us a vote? Yes, some Back Benchers would vote against it, but Labour would vote for it and support the Home Secretary because we think it is the right thing to do. Why not let Parliament have the vote it was promised?</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/20">We have just had three quarters of an hour of the Chancellor trying his smoke and mirrors trick, but the Home Secretary has gone one step further with a disappearing magic trick! One minute the European arrest warrant is there, the next minute it is gone. One minute you see it, the next it disappears. It&#8217;s her Paul Daniels act! Unfortunately, she has sent the Justice Secretary to be her glamorous assistant Debbie McGee and to come and present it to the House! She thinks they&#8217;ll like it&#8212;not a lot, but she thinks they&#8217;ll like it! <i>[</i><i>Laughter.</i><i>]</i> The business motion is a complete joke.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/21">She should withdraw it and come back with more sensible proposals.</p>
	<p pid="b.1205.4/22">We will vote for the regulations, but we will vote against this business motion, because it is a joke, a complete nonsense. It does not provide Parliament with the vote we need on the European arrest warrant, but is simply because the Government are scared of a rebellion. They want to say one thing to one group of people and another thing to another group. They are not being straight with the House. The Home Secretary knows she is playing fast and loose with very serious measures on tackling crime and national security. It is irresponsible, and it is playing fast and loose with Parliament as well. I urge her and the Justice Secretary to rethink, ditch this business motion, come back with something more sensible and let us vote on the measures this country needs.</p>

	<p pid="b.1207.0/1">This is a disgraceful way of going about a very important matter. It is tainted with chicanery. It is not the way that Parliament should be treated. Right from the very beginning of this issue, the European Scrutiny Committee, the Home Affairs Committee and the Justice Committee have complained about the lack of transparency and consultation and the manner in which the Home Secretary has been treating the House. It is completely unbelievable that she should come to the House and, presumably, try to argue&#8212;as we shall discover in due course&#8212;that this is about the EAW when it clearly is not.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.0/2">If the motion were a Bill, it would be dealt with in separate clauses and parts, all of which could be amended, but this motion is unamendable. That has not yet been properly considered. This is being done to avoid a real decision being taken today, as was promised to us by the Prime Minister only a few weeks ago, and by the Home Secretary in the article in <i>The Sunday Telegraph</i> and in the letter that the shadow Home Secretary referred to. This is a travesty of our parliamentary proceedings, and that is a reason in itself to vote against the business motion, as I shall be doing. I could give many other reasons for doing so, but it is fundamentally about a lack of transparency and honesty in going about issues we need to deal with.</p>

	<p pid="b.1207.3/1">It is a pleasure to follow the Chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee. I co-signed a letter with him and the Chair of the Justice Select Committee over the weekend to express our concern about how this legislation is being put through the House.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.3/2">Mr Speaker, you were clear that this was not a vote on the EAW, but the Lord Chancellor, when he moved the business motion, told the House that we were voting on the full package of 35 measures, so that voting for the motion would allow the Government to inform the European Commission that we had opted back into the 35 measures. Mr Speaker, I prefer to accept your ruling that this is about the 10 regulations, not the EAW. The Select Committee was clear that the House should have the opportunity to vote on the EAW separately, because we felt that it was controversial and had huge implications for the British people. The position of the European Scrutiny Committee is that we should vote on each of the 35 measures. I am not against that idea; I just do not think we can do that tonight. We will need additional time to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1207.3/3">I share all the concerns of <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase>. This is a shambolic attempt to get a vote on an issue of fundamental importance to the British people. I hope the motion will be withdrawn to give us an opportunity to vote on these measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1208.0/1">From time to time during my career here, the procedures of the House have stood in the way of its intention. Often on these occasions, the matters have been resolved on the basis of, I suppose, allowing a more mature consideration, and with the Treasury Bench seeking the opportunity to take with it all the disparate opinions within the House, making it clear that nothing is being done that thwarts the will of the House to discuss a matter of such significance as the one under consideration today. Would it not therefore be appropriate for the Treasury Bench to take the opportunity of having more mature consideration and to withdraw this motion, proposing instead one that would meet the aspirations of those who either support or oppose&#8212;</p>

He is absolutely right to say that the way we do our business in this House is just as important as the business we transact. That is why we have rules that govern our proceedings. For centuries we have believed in this country that we govern by consent, not by arbitrary decisions made solely by the Government. We govern by consent, not by proxy motions that are reinterpreted by the Government. That is why it is important that the way we do our business, especially on a matter that affects the imprisonment and extradition of British nationals and nationals of other countries coming back to this country&#8212;a matter of essential importance to people&#8217;s personal liberty&#8212;should be debated properly, openly and transparently on a proper motion that, as <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase> said, should be amendable. The motion should not be advanced to the House by proxy or by some subsidiary means; it must be open and clear.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.5/2">The Home Secretary and the Prime Minister stated quite categorically in this Chamber, and elsewhere in letters, that they would ensure that there was a proper vote on the matter of the European arrest warrant. Mr Speaker, you have said today that this will not be a vote on the European arrest warrant, yet the Justice Secretary, who should know better, has told us that he will reinterpret the message as meaning that this is a vote on the European arrest warrant. I simply say to the Government that for the sake of legal certainty&#8212;so that lawyers will not be paid vast quantities of money to debate in extradition courts whether the law has changed and whether it applies&#8212;it is essential that they withdraw the motion, and that they should have tabled a proper motion in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.5/3">It is no good the Government coming here and saying, &#8220;The House may pass one thing, but we will interpret it to mean exactly the opposite.&#8221; The House agreed unanimously that the rules should be changed in relation to Magnitsky, and that anyone who had been involved in his murder or in the corruption that he had</p>
	<p pid="b.1209.5/4">unveiled would not be allowed in this country. The Government agreed to that at the time, and have done nothing subsequently. The Government let the Wild Animals in Circuses Bill go through, and have done nothing since. We cannot have a Government who conclude, arbitrarily, &#8220;The House has decided one thing, but we choose to believe that it means exactly the opposite.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.1210.0/1">Many of us thought that we would have an opportunity today to debate the very weighty question of whether this country should opt back into 35 important measures relating to criminal justice, and put it under European Court of Justice and European Union control. We looked forward to a debate and a vote on that high principle, which includes the important and contentious European arrest warrant, but also a number of other measures that constitute the building blocks for a system in which our criminal justice would be conducted primarily under the central control of the European Union rather than that of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.0/2">We welcome the Government&#8217;s wish to engage and to allow us a reasonable length of time in which to debate those matters, followed by a concluding vote at 10 pm, but you, Mr Speaker, have told us, very wisely and helpfully, that that is not what the business motion says, and, through you, I urge Ministers to consider amending it. As I understand the position, you would probably be sympathetic if they wished to do so. We could debate their regulations for 90 minutes, and during the remaining time, until 10 pm, we could debate the much wider issues of substance. We could discuss whether we wish to opt into all those measures and what we think of the European arrest warrant. Some believe it to be the biggest of all the measures, which is in itself debatable. I think that justice would then be seen to be done by the wider public.</p>
	<p pid="b.1210.0/3">I hope, Mr Speaker, that I am not taking liberties by suggesting to Ministers, through you, that a simple amendment to the business motion might provide a way out of this dilemma, and enable the House properly to consider the wider constitutional issues.</p>

	<p pid="b.1211.3/1">There are many differences over the European arrest warrant, as there are bound to be. They are legitimate differences, and it is important for us to debate the subject and vote accordingly. I believe that there is a unanimous view that there should be a debate on the actual issue of the European arrest warrant. When I received the Whip, like other Members, I was utterly surprised by Monday&#8217;s business, in which there was not one mention of a debate on the European arrest warrant. Ministers clearly consider that they were clever, and that they would contain and minimise a vote against what is being proposed. I can understand that, and it is not unique to this Government, but what is unfortunate, and what is a form of deception, is to bring a motion before the House for debate which is basically about the European arrest warrant but to avoid those three words.</p>
	<p pid="b.1211.3/2">I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that if we are confused and if we do not like it, what about people outside? There are people who pay close attention to what we are doing, who are interested in the work of Parliament, and who believed that today we were going to debate the European arrest warrant; and they will see the exchanges that have occurred, and which have lasted over an hour, about whether or not the actual issue was to be debated today in the House of Commons. I therefore put it to you, Mr Speaker, that the way to resolve this issue is for the Treasury Bench to make it clear that there should be a debate today on an appropriate manuscript motion on the issue of the European arrest warrant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1211.3/3">Let us decide one way or the other whether we are in favour of it, instead of all this muddying the water&#8212;this desire to deceive, this desire to give the opposite impression &#8212;so that at the end of the day when the vote occurs the Government can say that there has been hardly any opposition from their own side. That is not the way to proceed. It is a way that only brings the reputation of this House into disrepute, which is all the more reason why we should proceed in a different way from that which the Government have suggested.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.0/1">If I remember correctly, Maine&#8217;s &#8220;Ancient law&#8221; makes the observation that justice lies in the interstices of procedure. That rubric has survived through our history since it was set and there is a truth in it. Today we are confronted with a motion that is incomprehensible, and with an understanding that seems sly and that is actually a means of trying to incline the public to believe other than what is so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.0/2">At the heart of this is a misconception about what this House represents. We must be straight with ourselves if we continue to allow the Executive to control&#8212;so completely and absolutely now&#8212;the Standing Orders of this House. This can be no joy for Labour, because Labour also started a Modernisation Committee that was determined to take over the Standing Orders. My overlong time in this House of Commons has led me to understand that the growth of Executive arrogance is unsupportable. We say that we are disconnected from the public outside and the issues outside, and that is because we are meaningless when we are confronted in the House with no motion and no real ability to discuss the very issue that moves many people in this country. What is the purpose of this House if the Administration&#8212;and a Conservative Administration at that, whose members had to suffer all the years of a huge new Labour majority&#8212;have not learned something, namely. that there has to be tolerance in this House and there has to be an ability to debate in this House?</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.0/3">This is what so angers one. This is what brings this Chamber into disrepute. We are not able to discuss the substance of what we stand for here, and that is wrong. I therefore think we should be talking out this motion until the end of time, until the Government come back with a proper motion before this House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1212.1/1">In my 31 years in this Chamber I have never seen the nonsense we have got this afternoon ever happen under any Government.

	<p pid="b.1212.4/1">This really is a sorry day for the Government. The motion to allocate time was tabled on the basis either of error or</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.4/2">of falsehood. The Whip went round to Conservative Members of Parliament and said that today&#8217;s motion would be on regulations including those on the European arrest warrant. My right hon. Friend the Chief Whip is one of the cleverest men in the House of Commons. He has a brain the size of a planet. He is of the highest quality and the most honourable gentleman one could find. I cannot believe that he would make a basic error of this kind.</p>
	<p pid="b.1212.4/3">We have Whips scuttling around the House saying that a vote will be taken tonight that will be indicative of what the House of Commons thinks about the European arrest warrant. That is a procedural absurdity. It is legislative legerdemain. The Government cannot conceivably decide that one vote is indicative of another. What might they decide next? Perhaps that a vote to cut taxes would indicate that we wanted to increase them, or that a vote in favour of longer prison sentences would indicate that we wanted to cut them? This is the way of tyranny, because it takes away the right of the House of Commons to hold the Executive to account.</p>

	<p pid="b.1213.1/1">My right hon. and learned Friend makes a point that is, as always, worth listening to, but he is in error. This matter needs to be debated thoroughly, because it is my contention that this is not accidental. A letter was sent to the shadow Home Secretary, <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40427" name="Yvette Cooper">the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase>, saying that we would have a vote. The Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury said to this House that there would be a vote. The Lord High Chancellor and the Home Secretary sent a letter to the European Scrutiny Committee promising us that there would be a vote on the European arrest warrant and all the other opt-ins and opt-outs. Now that we come to it, however, it is proposed that there will be a vote, after extra debating time, on a number of relatively obscure measures that require statutory instruments, and that that will be intended to determine the view of the House. That is not proper parliamentary procedure; it is an outrageous abuse of parliamentary procedure.</p>

Friend the Home Secretary&#8212;on European matters, but this debate today is of a degree worse than our disagreements. Our disagreements are polite and they reflect our fiercely held views, which we discuss in an upright and, I hope, proper fashion. This approach and this motion are fundamentally underhand. That is why there is such anger, not only on the Conservative Benches and among Eurosceptics. The Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, the right hon. Member for</p>

A most courteous approach was made to me on her behalf suggesting that it might be helpful to the House if she were to wind up the debate, and I agreed to that request. It is not that I am seeking to delay the Home Secretary for one moment; it is that there is provision for others to speak. When they have finished doing so, the Home Secretary can and will speak, and we will look forward to that.

The opt-out provisions are unique to the United Kingdom, and were negotiated by the previous Administration. Under the terms of protocol 36, the UK had to decide before the end of May 2014 whether it wished to opt out of all the police and criminal justice measures&#8212;some 130 in all&#8212;that predate the Lisbon treaty. The opt-out had to be exercised en masse; we could not simply leave the measures that we did not like.</p>

We have brought those particular regulations before the House because they are the only ones that we need to transpose into UK legislation. I will come on to comment on the European arrest warrant.

	<p pid="b.1226.1/1">It has been made clear that it is possible to discuss the other measures in our debate today, and I have explained why the regulations include only certain measures&#8212;those required to be transposed into UK legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/2">My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40142" name="Julian Huppert">the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert)</phrase> was right to refer to the package of 35 measures being the product of tough negotiations in Europe. In July, when we last gave Government time for a debate on the issue, I informed the House that good progress had been made in negotiations with the European Commission and other member states and that we were close to reaching an in-principle agreement. The matter had been discussed at the General Affairs Council in June, but some member states had expressed technical reservations. I published Command Paper 8897, which included the full list of measures discussed at the General Affairs Council and impact assessments of each of those measures. I had hoped to be able to return the matter to Parliament for consideration before the summer recess, but the reservations expressed by other member states meant it was not possible to do so. In September, two of those member states lifted their reserves and I am pleased to be able to inform the House that on Friday Spain, the one remaining member state blocking the deal, formally lifted its reservation in Brussels.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/3">I believe that the deal we have negotiated in Europe and that we are bringing before the House today is a good one for the United Kingdom. It includes important tools such as SIS II, the second-generation Schengen information system, which the United Kingdom is scheduled to join shortly. That will further strengthen our ability to detect foreign criminals at the border, including individuals wanted in their own countries for serious crimes such as rape and murder.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/4">The package of measures we have negotiated includes Europol, which does excellent work under its British director, Rob Wainwright, to tackle cross-border crimes. Three weeks ago, for example, Europol played a key role in Operation Trivium, a UK-wide operation led by West Midlands police that saw police forces from 14 European countries jointly targeting foreign criminals in the UK. Senior officers from across Europe came together at the control centre in Edgbaston to witness the operation in action and Europol provided a mobile unit to co-ordinate activities on the ground. In the first 48 hours of the operation, more than 700 suspected criminals were arrested and a further 950 were handed on-the-spot fines for minor offences, cautioned or summonsed to court. They included a 51-year-old Polish man arrested on suspicion of involvement in a fraud of more than &#163;11,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1226.1/5">Europol also played a key part in tackling the horsemeat scandal that so appalled this House and the British public last year, as did Eurojust, another of the measures in our package.</p>

	<p pid="b.1229.6/1">I will make a little more progress and will then give way to my hon. Friend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229.6/2">For the reasons I have just given, the Government have always been clear that it is in our national interest to remain part of these vital measures and to do so without an operational gap.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229.6/3">Over the past four years, and particularly since we announced our intention to exercise the opt-out in July 2013, a number of hon. Members have proposed alternative courses of action to me and my right hon. Friend the Justice Secretary as we have undertaken our negotiations in Europe. A number of hon. Members are interested in the position of Denmark with regard to justice and home affairs matters. Some have said that it provides a potential model for the UK to follow. I believe that it is a false comparison. Denmark has a separate protocol to the Lisbon treaty that excludes it from participating in post-Lisbon justice and home</p>
	<p pid="b.1229.6/4">affairs measures. It has concluded third-country agreements with the EU because it has no other way to participate in those measures.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229.6/5">By contrast, protocol 36 to the Lisbon treaty sets out the process by which the UK can opt out of and rejoin justice and home affairs measures. There is no precedent for an international agreement between the EU and a member state that already has the ability to participate in EU measures by specific means. The European Commission argues that protocol 36 provides adequate provision and renders a third-country agreement unnecessary. Riding roughshod over that would involve walking away from a very good deal for the UK and risk damaging our support for future negotiations in Europe. Even if we could persuade the European Union, it would take years to thrash out, guaranteeing a lengthy operational gap in the fight against crime and a risk to the British public that would be unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229.6/6">Finally, I hope hon. Members will heed the Danish example in full. Every agreement that Denmark has made separately with the European Union has required Denmark to submit to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. In effect, the Danish agreements that have caught the attention of some hon. Members simply bind Denmark to EU law by another legal means. I suspect that is not what those hon. Members had in mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.1229.6/7">I have explained that only a certain number of the measures require transposition through the regulations before the House. The regulations make provision to give effect to the European supervision order in England and Wales, and in Northern Ireland. That allows British subjects to be bailed back to the UK, rather than spend months and months abroad awaiting trial. It will therefore stand alongside the reforms that we have made to the arrest warrant, making it easier for people like Andrew Symeou, whose case has been championed admirably by my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40247" name="Nick de Bois">the Member for Enfield North (Nick de Bois)</phrase>, to be bailed back to the UK and preventing such injustices from occurring in future. The connection between the supervision order and the arrest warrant, one of which is being transposed in the regulations and one of which is not, is an example of the inter-connectedness of the package of measures.</p>

	<p pid="b.1230.0/1">My right hon. Friend is being very generous in giving way.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.0/2">I mean this question completely sincerely. One reason why I passionately support the British courts and jury system is that one never knows when one might get into trouble or be wrongly accused oneself. I realise that it is extremely unlikely, and it is a personal question, but if she were wrongly accused of something in, say, Croatia, would she rather rely on British justice and traditional extradition procedures or on the say-so of a prosecutor in Croatia?</p>

	<p pid="b.1230.1/1">If my hon. Friend will forgive me, I will come on to explain how we have changed the European arrest warrant so that British judges are now interposed in the system in a way that they were not always in the past. Those measures have been an important advantage, and some arrest warrant requests to the UK have already been rejected as a result.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.1/2">I do not want to lose sight of some of the other measures in the package. For example, the regulations also cover the European criminal records information</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.1/3">system. We are already taking steps to identify foreign nationals who are abusing our openness and hospitality by committing crimes in this country. Operation Nexus, a groundbreaking initiative taken by the Metropolitan police and immigration enforcement, helped us to remove more than 2,500 foreign nationals during its first two years, including 150 dangerous immigration offenders considered by the police to represent a particularly serious threat. As I said, it began with the Metropolitan police, but it has recently been extended to the West Midlands, Merseyside and Greater Manchester forces and six other forces including Police Scotland, and we wish to extend its work to every force in England and Wales. ECRIS is a key tool that supports that operation and thereby helps to keep our streets safe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.1/4">As people find it easier to move around the globe, we must ensure that our law enforcement agencies can exchange information more readily too. In 2006, the UK made and received no requests at all for criminal records from other EU member states. In 2012-13 we made over 25,000 requests, and last year that figure was 41,500. I recently announced that the Government would increase the number of criminal record checks on foreign nationals by introducing full checks on foreign nationals arrested in the Metropolitan police area. Given that 30% of those arrested in London are now foreign nationals, it is clear that that is an operational necessity. That is also why our package of 35 measures also includes the Swedish initiative, which simplifies the exchange of information and intelligence between law enforcement agencies, and the data protection measure, which protects personal data transferred in the fight against crime. Those measures both require transposition, and they are covered in the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1230.1/5">Another of the measures in the regulations provides for joint investigation teams between our police and their European counterparts. It allows our police to participate in cross-border operations such as Operation Birkhill, which saw five criminals sentenced to a total of 36 years&#8217; imprisonment this summer for their involvement in the degrading trafficking into the UK of over 120 women from Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland; and Operation Rico, which resulted in 110 arrests, mostly in the UK and Spain.</p>

	<p pid="b.1231.1/3">Zvirgzds, a Latvian national convicted of controlling prostitution, firearms and drug offences and assault. In April 2012, he was sentenced to thirteen and a half years&#8217; imprisonment in the UK, and in June this year he was transferred out of this country to a prison in Latvia, where he will serve the remainder of his sentence. Had it not been for the prisoner transfer measure, he would have remained in a British prison at a cost to the British taxpayer of more than &#163;100,000.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.1/4">As I indicated earlier, I have taken part in a number of debates on these issues. From those debates, and from the debate that we had earlier and the comments that right hon. and hon. Members have made today, it is absolutely clear that the measure that attracts the most interest from Members is the European arrest warrant.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.1/5">Extradition is always an emotive subject. It raises important questions about the civil liberties of British citizens, the quality of justice in other countries, the role of our own courts and how we bring criminals to justice, and I understand those concerns. I remind hon. Members that I am the Home Secretary who blocked the extradition of Gary McKinnon to the United States, and who reformed our extradition arrangements so that, when prosecution is possible in both this country and another, British courts can block extradition overseas if they believe it is in the interests of justice to do so. I therefore share many of the concerns that have been raised about the European arrest warrant in the past. Indeed, as a member of the shadow Cabinet I voted against its transposition into British law by the last Labour Government. That is why, as Home Secretary, I have legislated to reform the operation of the arrest warrant and increase the protections that we can offer to British people and others who are wanted for extradition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1231.1/6">The changes that we made through the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act 2014 mean that the arrest warrant that sits in our package of 35 measures is a better and safer arrest warrant than the one operated over the past decade. Under the last Government, British citizens could be extradited for disproportionately minor offences, so the law has been changed to ensure that arrest warrants are refused for those suspected of minor offences. A British judge must now consider whether the alleged offence and likely penalty is sufficient to make someone&#8217;s extradition proportionate, and a British judge must also consider whether measures less coercive than extradition are available to foreign authorities.</p>

	<p pid="b.1232.0/2">The Home Secretary knows well that a Mr John Downey walked free from the Old Bailey earlier this year. He had been charged in connection with the Hyde park bombing, which killed four innocent British soldiers, and was also sought in connection with the Enniskillen bombing and the murder of two Ulster Defence Regiment men in Northern Ireland. He walked free because the Northern Ireland Office had signed off a letter in 2007&#8212;not during the current Administration&#8212;for a category of people known as the on-the-runs. Mr Downey is now enjoying the air of County Donegal. Would the UK opting into the European arrest warrant help the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland retrieve Mr Downey to face serious criminal charges if the Police Service of Northern Ireland had sufficient evidence?</p>

The National Crime Agency is now refusing arrest warrants where it is obvious that the dual criminality test has not been met. It has done so nearly 40 times since our reforms came into force in July. Under the old arrest warrant, people were being detained for long periods overseas before being charged or standing trial. We have changed the law to require that a decision to charge, and a decision to try the person, has been made in the requesting country before they can be extradited.</p>

In addition, we have also made changes so that an individual can be transferred temporarily to give evidence and be returned to the United Kingdom, or to give evidence by video link, for example, so that they do not need physically to be taken to the other country concerned.</p>

The first is an administrative decision taken by the National Crime Agency as the body that initially receives the request. Then there is the possibility for the courts to make a determination about proportionality, and they will consider a variety of issues. It is not a tick-box approach; the courts will make judgments not just about the nature of the crime but about the nature of the disposal available in the other member state in relation to that crime, so that they can decide whether the arrest warrant is appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1236.4/1">I am very grateful for my right hon. Friend&#8217;s elucidations. What I am seeking to understand is why we cannot opt out of all the measures, including the EAW, and negotiate a bespoke arrangement without the erosion of democratic control through the European Court of Justice and other means. I listened very carefully to what she said earlier&#8212;the Commission&#8217;s view that this was unprecedented&#8212;and I appreciate it would take time and a lot of diplomatic elbow grease, but can she confirm that there is no legal bar to that course of action and that it is a question of political will?</p>

	<p pid="b.1236.5/1">I recognise my hon. Friend&#8217;s point. It is one he has made to me on a number of occasions. I have addressed the two areas where people have sometimes said that alternative arrangements could be made. The first is that we would fall back on the Council of Europe convention of 1957. I have been absolutely clear in the remarks I have just made that there is one crucial aspect that would cause us problems: the length of time that extradition procedures would take. As the House of Lords Extradition Law Committee has just said, that could undermine public safety.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.5/2">There is another aspect in which that would be problematic were we to be negotiating with other member states. Without the arrest warrant there are 22 member states in the EU, including France, Germany and Spain, that could refuse to extradite their own nationals to the UK. In the past five years alone, more than 100 people from those countries have been returned to Britain to face justice, many for serious crimes including rape and murder. One of those was Andreas Ververopoulos, a Greek, who committed a violent and sickening sexual assault on a 16-year-old girl in Hampshire in 2007 and then fled home to Greece. In July 2013, Hampshire police linked him to the crime using DNA and an arrest warrant was used to return him to the UK. In April this year, he pleaded guilty to his crimes and was sentenced to nine years&#8217; imprisonment. The judge in the case said it was</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.5/3">&#8220;an appalling attack on a young and vulnerable girl&#8221;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1236.5/4">After seven years of further suffering, the victim and the victim&#8217;s family finally saw justice done.</p>

	<p pid="b.1237.0/1">I, too, have looked at that case. I agree with the Home Secretary that it is an appalling example of a terrible crime. The European arrest warrant was rightly used in that case. Will she say why the EAW is not on the Order Paper?</p>

	<p pid="b.1237.1/1">The right hon. Lady knows that I have answered that question previously.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.1/2">The right hon. Lady is right that the case I cited was a particularly difficult and awful case in terms of the crime that was committed. Without the arrest warrant, the individual who committed that crime would still be in Greece today. Before it came into force, Greece did not surrender its own nationals. Indeed, it entered a reservation to the 1957 convention specifically barring the extradition of Greek nationals, so the victims of brutal crimes, such as in this case, would go on suffering. We owe it to them to heed the old warning that justice delayed is justice denied.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.1/3">I want to come on to one final relevant point that was hinted at by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40667" name="John Redwood">the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)</phrase> earlier: the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This pass was sold when <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40348" name="Gordon Brown">the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)</phrase> signed the Lisbon treaty. Our opt-out only applies to those policing and criminal justice measures that precede it. Since the Lisbon treaty came into effect, the UK has signed up to 90 new justice and home affairs measures, accepting the jurisdiction of the ECJ over them. We face the same choice today: whether to accept the jurisdiction of the ECJ over the small package of measures that we wish to remain part of from <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>, so that our law enforcement agencies can continue to use those powers to fight crime and keep us safe; or reject those measures and accept the risk to public protection that that involves. That invidious choice is the result of a poor treaty, badly negotiated. In my mind, however, it is clear: this is a vote about law and order, not a vote about Europe.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.1/4">I am certainly no enthusiast for the European Court of Justice. The ECJ should not have the final say over matters such as substantive criminal law or our international relations. That is why, as I indicated earlier, 100 or so measures the Government have opted out of, and will not rejoin, include more than 20 minimum standards</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.1/5">measures on sensitive matters such as racism and xenophobia. It is why we have opted out of, and will not rejoin, the EU-US extradition agreement. It is this place that should have the final say over our laws on these matters, and Her Majesty&#8217;s Government should be able to renegotiate such arrangements as they see fit.</p>
	<p pid="b.1237.1/6">I understand the concerns raised about the European Court of Justice in the many debates we have had on protocol 36. I believe we must look again at this matter in our renegotiations with the European Union before the referendum that a Conservative Government will deliver by the end of 2017. In the meantime, however, we must act in the national interest to keep the British public safe. We have therefore exercised an opt-out, which it seems no one else would have exercised. We have brought back more than 100 justice and home affairs powers that had already been signed away. We have listened to those who work tirelessly to keep us safe on which of the tools at their disposal are vital to their important work. We have gone to Europe and negotiated a good deal for the United Kingdom. We have won support from the Commission and other member states to remain part of a smaller package of measures in the national interest. Now we must vote to transpose those measures that require transposing and, in doing so, vote to seal the deal.</p>

	<p pid="b.1238.0/1">Today we have had a completely shambolic debate. The Home Secretary has given an excellent account of why we should support policies that are not on the Order Paper. She has given an excellent defence of the European arrest warrant, which is not on the Order Paper. I agree with her that the European arrest warrant is immensely important. It helps us to fight crime. It helps the police, in Britain and across Europe, to stop murderers, traffickers and sex offenders. It helps us to deport more than 1,000 suspected foreign criminals primarily to their own countries to face justice. Given that there is a majority in this House in favour of the European arrest warrant, why on earth are we not voting for it? Why the sophistry? Why the games? Why the dancing around? It is just baffling that the Home Secretary is playing games with something so important to criminal justice and to the fight against international crime and terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/2">The draft regulations cover a series of measures&#8212;the 11 measures that are on the Order Paper&#8212;and we support them. The confiscation orders, freezing orders on criminal records, the European supervision order, the joint investigation teams&#8212;we support them all. We support the measures on confiscation and freezing orders because no country in the EU should become a safe haven for criminal assets. We should be able to confiscate them wherever they are held. We support the two measures on criminal records and conviction. Exchanged data on the conviction of EU nationals should be harnessed for us to identify, locate and stop EU criminals entering our country and committing crimes. We support the European supervision order as a vital reform to interact with the arrest warrant, because suspects awaiting trial should, if appropriate, be in their home state. We support the joint investigation teams because we saw with Operation Golf that co-operation in complex investigations means we can arrest 126 traffickers from across Europe and</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/3">safeguard vulnerable children not just in Britain but across the continent too. We support the prisoner transfer framework, because it makes it harder for other member states to refuse to take back their nationals from our prisons. We should have that co-operation in place.</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/4">We support the rest of the 35 measures that are not on the Order Paper&#8212;the measures we do not have a chance to demonstrate our support for and to vote for tonight. We saw, with the problem of foreign criminals entering in the UK, that the Schengen information system is also vital and necessary. We need Europol to support and co-ordinate cross-border investigations. We support closer co-operation on combating child abuse imagery, because with this crime there are no borders and the police need to work with police across Europe and across the world too. We support action to tackle football hooliganism across borders, and as we have made clear many times in the House, we particularly support the EAW. The Association of Chief Police Officers has described it as an essential weapon, and distinguished legal figures, including the former President of the Supreme Court, have argued that</p>
	<p pid="b.1238.0/5">&#8220;Britain also risks becoming a safe haven for fugitives from justice, a handful of them British citizens, but the vast majority foreign nationals wanted for crimes elsewhere in Europe.&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.1239.1/1">As the hon. Gentleman knows, there were cases before the introduction of the EAW when it took years to extradite suspects&#8212;for example, suspected terrorists back to France. We should not be in that situation. If we have people in our country wanted in France for serious crimes, particularly terrorists allegations, we should be able to deport them to face justice.</p>

	<p pid="b.1239.2/1">Is not the important point that in a completely multilateral system we do not stand out, whereas if everybody else opted into the justice and home affairs measures and the EAW, and we alone stood outside, we would become a safe haven, because it would be much easier to stay in this country for extended periods than in any other EU state?</p>

	<p pid="b.1239.3/1">The hon. Gentleman is right. It is suggested that we could arrange separate extradition treaties, but in the past when we did that, they took too long and caused immense problems. In the case of Rachid Ramda, the Algerian national arrested in the UK in connection with a terrorist attack on the Paris transport system, France sought extradition from the UK in 1995. The process was completed in 2005. That was when the EAW was not in place.</p>

	<p pid="b.1240.2/1">Nice try. I will come to the issues that the Home Secretary has opted out of in a second, but the idea that the Home Secretary&#8217;s utter shambles today is the fault of the previous Labour Government is pushing the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s political argument to a ludicrous extreme.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.2/2">The statistics are clear: the EAW helps us to deport foreign criminals and terrorists, and of the 1,057 people removed under an EAW last year, only 43 were UK nationals, and eight of those were connected to child sex offences. It is because the EAW and the other measures are so important that we should be having a vote on them now.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.2/3">The Home Secretary has form. We saw it when she was asked about the net migration promise. No ifs no buts, the Prime Minister made a promise&#8212;a contract with the British people, he said&#8212;but she said it was no longer a promise but a comment. We saw it again today when she dismissed the Prime Minister&#8217;s promise to the House that there would be a vote on the EAW.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.2/4">Frankly, the whole opt in, opt out process has been a con. It is an in/out hokey cokey back to where we started. On the measures to be opted out of, the Prime Minister promised the biggest transfer of power from Brussels back to Britain by opting out of more than 100 measures, but what powers in practice have been brought back? Britain will no longer be expected to have a good practice guide on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters, but we will keep one anyway; Britain will not sign up to having a contact point for cross-border allegations of corruption, but the police and Border Force will still have one anyway; we will not sign up to receive a directory of specialist counter-terrorism officers, but we will get someone to send it to us on the side; we will not sign up to a whole series of accession measures that apply to other countries and did not cover us anyway; we were already opting out of the European judicial network, and we will carry on opting out of it; and we will not be involved in setting up contact points to deal with the other countries in pursuing those responsible for genocide, but we will&#8212;quietly&#8212;let Europol know whom they should ring.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.2/5">Time and again, the Home Secretary claims to be repatriating huge numbers of powers, when in fact she is simply opting out of dozens of measures that either do not operate anymore or which cover areas where we plan to carry on regardless, whether we are in or out.</p>
	<p pid="b.1240.2/6">So much for a repatriation of powers&#8212;it is a repatriation of other people&#8217;s phone numbers. She has taken back the</p>

	<p pid="b.1241.9/1">I think there was dreadful decision making in that case. The police should not have continued with the EAW&#8212;they should have withdrawn it&#8212;and I think it was a bad decision. However, the hon. Gentleman will know of cases in this country where the police wrongfully arrest somebody; we do not then conclude that the police should not have a power of arrest. Instead, we say there should be proper and thoughtful decision making. What happened to that family should</p>
	<p pid="b.1241.9/2">not have happened, and the whole House will have immense sympathy with them. They should not have been put through what they were put through.</p>

	<p pid="b.1242.0/1">Of course, the big difference is that in the case of the Kings, this European arrest warrant is subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. It overtakes the Supreme Court; it overtakes this Parliament because the Lisbon treaty has allowed it to do so. That was passed by the right hon. Lady&#8217;s Government, but the bottom line is that it has created grave injustice.</p>

	<p pid="b.1242.1/1">As I have made very clear, the police and the CPS should have withdrawn that arrest warrant much earlier; it was the wrong thing to do. I also think it important for the police to be able to work with other police forces right across European and right across the world, and to have these particular powers in place to work in Europe. The Home Secretary agrees, and we agree with her that this is the right thing to do, but the way in which we have had this debate in Parliament today has been utterly chaotic.</p>

	<p pid="b.1242.3/1">My hon. Friend is right. A huge number of people, including more than 1,000 foreign citizens, are deported from this country, having been suspected of committing crimes, to face justice. I think it is right that we have the ability to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.3/2">The Home Secretary has basically told us that we should be grateful for the debate that the Government have somehow conceded should take place. You gave your ruling, Mr Speaker, that we were not having a vote on the European arrest warrant. The Home Secretary then stood up and completely contradicted that. She went on to say that we were voting on a package of 35 measures and that it was not a &#8220;pick and mix&#8221;. Why, then, has she picked and mixed only 11 of the measures and put them on the Order Paper rather than the full package of 35? The Prime Minister said categorically that we would have a vote on the European arrest warrant, yet he has refused to allow it.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.3/3">Again I urge the Home Secretary to rethink. It is not too late for her to rethink and to provide the House with a specific vote on the European arrest warrant. It is true that some of her Back Benchers would vote against it, but the rest of us would vote for it. On the Labour Benches, we want enthusiastically to endorse the Home Secretary&#8217;s measures; on the Conservative Benches, Members want rebelliously to oppose them&#8212;but we all want a parliamentary vote.</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.3/4">Is not the truth that the Government took the European arrest warrant out of the motion because the Home Secretary and the Chief Whip thought they were being clever? They took it out because they wanted to minimise</p>
	<p pid="b.1242.3/5">the rebellion. They wanted to tell journalists that it was a vote on the European arrest warrant, but tell the Back Benchers not to worry because they were voting only on prisoner transfer agreements. They wanted to pretend to Parliament that this was a vote on a package of 35 measures, yet let their MPs fend off UKIP in their constituencies by claiming that they never voted for the most controversial plans.</p>

The Speaker has been very clear that this motion does not include a vote on the European arrest warrant. The right hon. Lady has said that she is going to reinterpret this in any way she chooses. That is an irresponsible way in which to treat this House. If she brings this motion back tomorrow, with all 35 measures included, we will support it.

If the previous question is negatived, the Chair will be required to put the question on the draft regulations straight away, with no further debate. Only if the previous question is withdrawn can the House continue to debate the regulations. As usual, withdrawing the previous question would require the unanimous assent of the House.

	<p pid="b.1246.0/1">Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am grateful for your ruling on what matters are relevant to the speech that can be made in relation to the question that has now been put.</p>
	<p pid="b.1246.0/2">The motion is about whether or not we should vote on the regulations that are before the House today. As I have made very clear, we put those regulations before the House today because of the timetable with which we are dealing in relation to ensuring that we are able to opt back in to the measures that we need to opt back in to by the requisite date&#8212;<phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>&#8212;if we are to ensure that there is no operational gap.</p>

	<p pid="b.1246.1/1">As my right hon. Friend will know, the European Scrutiny Committee has considered all these matters carefully. If, as is the normal course of events, we were debating a Bill rather than what is provided for by the Lisbon treaty, all 35 of these measures would be before us in the form of separate clauses, and amendments would have been tabled. What we have been debating, however, is a non-amendable motion. Is my right hon. Friend aware that the Home Affairs Committee itself said that there must be a separate vote on the European arrest warrant? How does she reconcile what she said this afternoon&#8212;and, indeed, what she is saying now&#8212;with the fact that there will undoubtedly be no vote on the European arrest warrant, although several Select Committees have said that there should be?</p>

Dissident republicans&#8212;the Real IRA, or whatever they want to call themselves&#8212;hide beyond the border in the Republic of Ireland. They come into Northern Ireland, and they murder people. We had a prison officer murdered two years ago, on <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-01">1 November</phrase>. If his widow and his family were aware that we are jeopardising the possibility of these measures coming into force, they would be deeply concerned, as I am.

The Minister for Justice in the Republic of Ireland has been very clear that if there is any operational gap at all between being in the European arrest warrant and opting back in to it, which there would be if we reject the package of measures, that would have serious consequences because it would be assumed that the arrangements currently in place would no longer be extant.</p>

	<p pid="b.1250.0/1">The answer is that a considerable number of Members have applied to speak in this debate. If memory serves, approximately 20, possibly slightly more, wished to speak in the debate as a whole, not in the debate on the previous question&#8212;obviously I have had no written applications on that, because it has only just been introduced. On the overall debate today, I had approximately 20 requests to speak. If those Members do not have the opportunity to do so, they will be denied the opportunity today, but they would not, of course, be denied the opportunity subsequently.</p>

	<p pid="b.1251.0/1">The right hon. Lady doth protest too much. If she wishes to have a debate and to vote on the regulations, that option is open to her tonight. However, she has chosen to play politics with the matter and tried to curtail the debate. As we have heard from the Speaker&#8217;s answer to the point of order raised by my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40053" name="Tony Baldry">the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry)</phrase>, a significant number of Members have indicated that they wish to speak in the debate on the regulations. The Speaker has granted latitude regarding the subjects that Members may speak about, and we are able to debate the European arrest warrant and other matters that are not in the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251.0/2">It is open to the House to have that debate but, sadly, the right hon. Lady has chosen to take a step that could curtail the debate and ensure that the regulations are not put before the House, in which case it would not be possible for Members to have their say on these important matters. She and I agree on the importance of these matters. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40266" name="Edward Leigh">the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)</phrase> and I might disagree on how some of them should be finalised and on whether we should be party to the measures, but I am clear that, at this point, the House of Commons has an opportunity to debate and vote on measures that relate to law and order in this country. These are important decisions for the House to make, and I have clarified for the House the exact form of the regulations.</p>

	<p pid="b.1251.2/1">I have made it absolutely clear that we have had an opportunity to debate these matters today. Ample time has been set aside for the debate. The point of the business motion on which we voted earlier was to ensure that we could have a lengthier debate, rather than the hour and a half that would normally be set aside to debate such regulations. The Government have given time to Members to make their points and contribute to the debate before voting on the regulations. We have been clear about our position on the regulations, but the shadow Home Secretary is now suggesting that she wishes to curtail that debate. The opportunity was there for hon. Members.</p>
	<p pid="b.1251.2/2">This is an important matter, on which different views are held. I have made it clear why we have brought forward the regulations and why we should debate and vote on them now.

	<p pid="b.1252.1/1">My hon. Friend puts it very well. We said that we would bring this debate to the House and enable a vote to take place according to a particular timetable, and we have done so. We have introduced the measures in the form of regulations because these are the only ones that require transposing into UK legislation. It is absolutely clear what the legislative approach would be. I think that Members would be unwilling to accept any decision by the Government not to introduce the regulations or not to show Members before the <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase> cut-off date what those regulations would look like.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.1/2">I have not been in this House for quite as long as some right hon. and hon. Members but it is clear to me that all hon. Members wanted an opportunity to stand up and put their arguments on a variety of matters, including the European arrest warrant. That option was open to Members tonight, but the shadow Home Secretary is saying that she wants to forget about the timetable and about our need to put the regulations before the House. Instead, she seems to be saying that the Government should not have brought the debate to the House, because she does not happen to think we have done it in the way she wanted. Well, that is not a position that I am willing to accept. I have made it clear why the regulations have been brought forward and why we feel it necessary to do so. We have debated the European arrest warrant and, had she not moved her motion, other Members would have been able to debate it as well. Her motion is not an attempt to ensure that the House has a proper debate. It is not an attempt to ensure that the House votes on these important measures. It is just an attempt to take away&#8212;</p>

Does she also agree that it is ironic, or perhaps just odd, for them to be talking about voting on this matter given that we are in this position as a result of the Lisbon treaty, which the Labour Government negotiated so ineptly and negligently? In the light of the incompetence of the previous Labour Government and of the current Labour Opposition, one might almost think that they were leaderless.</p>

He has made an important point.</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.3/2">Earlier, I asked the right hon. Lady who had negotiated the opt-out, opt-in arrangements in the Lisbon treaty. She was unwilling to answer the question, because it</p>
	<p pid="b.1252.3/3">followed on from her complaining about the inadequacies of those arrangements. Those inadequate arrangements were negotiated and introduced by her own Government, of whom she was a Cabinet member. She refused to accept that point, however. She will not accept any suggestion that we are now having to deal with these opt-out, opt-in arrangements as a direct result of the Labour Government&#8217;s negotiations on the Lisbon treaty. This situation is not a result of the way in which this Government have been dealing with these matters. I have made it clear that we should have been able to continue the debate tonight. It is quite wrong for the right hon. Lady to have introduced the new motion and I hope that, on that basis, hon. Members will vote against it.</p>

	<p pid="b.1253.0/1">May I ask the shadow Home Secretary to reconsider the rather extraordinary step she has taken of presenting this archaic motion and, indeed, ask the House to consider quite where we are getting to on this issue? Nobody enjoys a good procedural row in the House of Commons as much as I do, and this is one of the best we have had for many years. It is perfectly straightforward&#8212;people are entitled to do this if they wish&#8212;but the House ought to reflect on what impression this is going to give to the outside world if we are not careful. We are discussing serious matters, yet we are all frolicking about in a rather schoolboy manner while the Whips try to get people to come back for an unexpected debate early in the evening. Let us be candid about what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1253.0/2">Some 20 or 30 years ago, this sort of thing was quite excusable, and people just thought it was one of the things this House did, usually at bizarre hours of the night. Nowadays, that is not the mood out there and we have to be careful that we do not feed the thoughts of those who do not have a very high regard for parliamentary debate and for party politics, and who believed they were told to expect, as every Member of Parliament expected, that we were going to spend an evening having a serious discussion on how we organise our policing and criminal justice system to deal with the extremely important and growing problem of international and cross-border crime. If the whole thing collapses in time for everybody to go and have a good dinner in the early evening, that will not rise to the expectations of serious members of the public who expect us to have a proper debate.</p>

We have the opportunity to find out whether the Government are even asking the right questions. Surely he can see that this is about Parliament seizing back the initiative and reconnecting representatives with the public, who are so upset, largely because of the incompetence of the Labour party.</p>

	<p pid="b.1253.2/1">I have every respect for the strongly held views of quite a lot of Members, including a lot on my side, who do not agree with me on this evening&#8217;s measures, but I think we would win back the respect of the public if we had a serious debate on them. We will not if we bog ourselves down in arcane procedural arguments, most of which are a novelty to people sitting in the Chamber</p>
	<p pid="b.1253.2/2">at the moment; we are going into hitherto unknown areas. I have never previously heard a Front-Bench spokesman move this motion at any stage in any serious debate, and I do not expect I will for many years to come.</p>
	<p pid="b.1253.2/3">I sympathise with the shadow Home Secretary&#8217;s position; indeed, I agree with her on quite a lot of things. Her problem is that she is leading for the Opposition when in policy terms she agrees with absolutely everything the Home Secretary is proposing, and so do I. I congratulate the shadow Home Secretary on her responsible approach to the subject. Everybody in this country responsible for the fight against crime and for the criminal justice system, and wanting to protect the public, is in favour of this opt-in. I am even more closely aligned with her than with some of my colleagues. I voted with her on the Maastricht treaty. I also voted with her on the Lisbon treaty, which paved the way for these international agreements being reached. That has enabled us to be so much more effective than we used to be in dealing with international criminal fugitives, who not only thrived on the Costa del Sol but were very present in London when they fled to this country before we steadily began to develop today&#8217;s arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="b.1253.2/4">The shadow Home Secretary has, however, got absolutely no arguments against the Government&#8217;s proposals on the merits. She is therefore making a mountain out of a molehill of a parliamentary procedural thing, which she thinks serves her purpose. Of course she is also enjoying herself, which I quite understand in ordinary party political terms. She is allying herself with my right hon. and hon. Friends who profoundly disagree with her and with the Home Secretary, and who are totally opposed to me in my support for these criminal justice measures. The alliance between the shadow Home Secretary and some of the most dyed in the wool Eurosceptics in this House is a very unlikely one, but I go back to where I started.</p>

	<p pid="b.1254.0/1">The right hon. and learned Gentleman knows that I agree with him on many issues relating to the European Union, but I gently suggest to him that good Europeans like us need to understand that we have to carry the country with us. That requires proper processes in this House, not chicanery and not a proxy motion; we need a proper motion on the Order Paper, which is why every Committee that has considered this matter&#8212;the Home Affairs Committee, the Justice Committee and the European Scrutiny Committee&#8212;decided that there should be a separate motion.

	<p pid="b.1254.1/1">I hope my opening remarks made it quite clear that the one thing I am not going to do is get drawn back into this entertaining procedural debate we had earlier on. It seems to me as plain as a pikestaff that if we have a vote at 10 pm on what is apparently on the Order Paper, the Government will be bound either to proceed with the opt-in to 35 measures or not to proceed with the opt-in to any of them. I repeat that the public are expecting the House of Commons to debate this seriously. It may be that there are not enough Members of Parliament against it and there are not enough arguments against it to delay us much longer, but I do not think that is the case. Some very respectable Government Members are going to oppose it&#8212;if they ever get the chance.</p>
	<p pid="b.1254.1/2">One way or another, this argument about whether or not the strict requirements of parliamentary procedure&#8212;allowing everybody to get wildly indignant about what we all know is synthetic anger at the way the procedures have been brought forward&#8212;is not a wise way of proceeding. One thing that unites most Members so far, all the way from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40584" name="William Cash">the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash)</phrase> to me, is that we think these are serious issues, and to break down now in an atmosphere of such trivial argument will be a triumph for the UKIP but something that all of us ought to regret.</p>

	<p pid="b.1255.0/1">It is always a privilege to follow my right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40513" name="Kenneth Clarke">the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke)</phrase>, with whom I disagree on only one thing: his statement that he enjoys procedural rows more than anyone else. The attendance in the House at the moment suggests that procedural matters can unite the House in ways that, weirdly, the serious matters we thought we were discussing today appear not to have done early on. I speak in the same terms as he has: in the context of strong support for the measures the Government are putting forward today and for the whole of the 35 measures, which is shared by the official Opposition.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.0/2">On the shadow Home Secretary&#8217;s motion that debate be curtailed&#8212;that the Question be not put&#8212;it is important that some issues that have not yet arisen be discussed before the House decides whether or not to support it. Never having been here for this sort of debate before, I confess that I am not clear whether there is a winding-up speech from the Government. I see, Mr Speaker, that it may not be entirely clear whether or not there is a winding-up speech&#8212;I shall take silence to indicate assent. If there is a Government winding-up speech, I would be grateful if the Minister could address the point that has not come up yet: the attitude of the courts to the motion that we pass.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.0/3">The point has been made by Members on both sides of this House that the motion before us tonight only commits us to legislating on a certain number of the 35 issues. Clearly, that will be a decision for the courts&#8212;the courts will enforce that. In the controversy, particularly about the European arrest warrant, there must clearly be the possibility of legal challenge at some stage, perhaps through an application for judicial review. There is always the prospect that what a Minister says at the Dispatch Box is taken as the intention of the Government of the day and has some weight with the court, but clearly it has much less weight than if this House had passed a legislative motion.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.0/4">I speak with some experience, and with some scars on my back. As Immigration Minister, I was advised by Government lawyers that if we had a debatable motion and said things from the Dispatch Box in the House of Commons, that would entail the courts acting in a certain way on asylum appeals. As it turned out, that was not an effective way to make the immigration and asylum courts change how they operate. Subsequently, the Home Secretary wisely put through primary legislation to allow that to happen.</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.0/5">That experience is analogous to the current situation. Strong supporter as I am of all the motions that the Government wish to opt back into, I wish to know whether</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.0/6">they would be fire-proofed against judicial challenge and whether, if we do not pass a motion explicitly opting into all of them, there is any area of ambiguity left that could be exploited by their opponents. It is perfectly clear from the debates that we have already had that the vast majority of Members are strongly in support not only of the motion before us tonight but of what could have been a wider motion to opt into all the elements&#8212;</p>
	<p pid="b.1255.0/7" class="italic">[Interruption.] </p>
	<p pid="b.1255.0/8">The Opposition Chief Whip seeks to intervene from a sedentary position. I know that it would be improper for her to stand up and do so, but we are living in interesting times and debating unusual things, so perhaps she would like to speak as well.</p>

	<p pid="b.1256.1/1">Sadly not. There is a serious point for the Government to address. Given the passions that have been aroused and the novel constitutional and procedural territory into which we have now gone, it would be particularly bad if the House went through all of this, presumably passed this motion and came back on another day to do it again, and then discovered that some of this could be challenged or even overturned in the courts at a later date. Assuming that this debate follows the normal course and there are winding-up speeches, I would be grateful if the Minister could address that issue.</p>

Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper)</phrase> and the Labour party along with a rather distinguished collection of rebels from at least two diametrically opposed positions on Europe and from at least four different political parties. That was because we all shared her frustration at the outcome of the procedural shenanigans that have landed us in this situation in which we are voting on only 11 of the 35 justice and home affairs measures, and not specifically the European arrest warrant, which is the very one that we all wanted to debate and vote on. Now, the right hon. Lady has got a bit carried away. I cannot see any earthly reason, however frustrated we all are with the situation, for not voting on the 11 that we all agree on. There is no logic to that whatever. What justification is there for not voting on co-operation between asset recovery offices of the member states in the field of tracing the proceeds of crime? That is something on which we all agree.</p>

However, that does not justify not voting on the statutory instrument that is required by the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="2014-12-01">1 December</phrase>, and voting on it tonight.

	<p pid="b.1257.1/1">Whatever the outcome of the Divisions tonight, I think it would be helpful for the House to know what happened to my constituent whom I visited in Wandsworth prison. I was appalled not only by how horrible prison is but by the miscarriage of justice experienced by my constituent.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.1/2">In Romania, my constituent gave the equivalent of &#163;2 to a young beggar. Two policemen immediately accused him of having sex with this boy, arrested him and took him to a cash point machine where he refused to pay them off as he had done nothing wrong. The prosecution was based on a witness who gave contradictory statements, and the policemen and the beggar were never seen or heard from again. My constituent was arrested on <phrase class="date" code="2014-08-11">11 August</phrase> and was released from Romanian prison on <phrase class="date" code="2004-11-03">3 November 2004</phrase> by a judge who recorded that there was no evidence against him and that the original arrest warrant was illegal.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.1/3">My constituent returned home to the UK later in November, following direct advice from the then consul at our embassy. He refused to give money to his interpreter&#8217;s friends to make his files disappear, and so without either his knowledge, or that of the British embassy in Bucharest, he was tried and convicted in absentia&#8212;illegally&#8212;in 2005. An appeal followed, which led to another trial, of which neither he nor the British embassy were made aware. It was only on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-03">3 March 2007</phrase>, when he received an e-mail from the Romanian desk of the Foreign Office that he first heard news of these events. It said:</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.1/4">&#8220;I am sorry that it has taken so long to get back to you.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.1/5">It told him that the Romanian Ministry of Justice had noted that</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.1/6">&#8220;you were sentenced to 7 years with&#8230;approximately &#163;1,000 fine in moral damages and&#8230;approximately &#163;140 for court expenses; your appeal against the above decision was made at the Bucharest Tribunal, the result was that your sentence was reduced to 4 years; this sentence was then open to appeal by the Prosecutor&#8217;s Office&#8230;and the initial sentence of 7 years was re-set. As far as we are aware, you will not be extradited but will have to pay the damages if the minor involved employs a lawyer to track you down.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.1/7">Although the first my constituent knew of these developments was on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-03">3 March 2007</phrase>, our embassy in Bucharest had been working to find out such information, without any success, for more than two years since the initial trial held in absentia.</p>
	<p pid="b.1257.1/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-05">5 March 2007</phrase>, just two days later, my constituent was arrested at work in Tenerife, on an European arrest warrant, to serve the sentence in Romania, without any promise of a retrial. He had never been given any opportunity to speak or give evidence in his own defence and was given no promise that he ever would.</p>

	<p pid="b.1258.1/1">My hon. Friend is quite right, but this case gets a lot worse. This man was then held in a Madrid prison while an appeal against his extradition was submitted. The Foreign Office sent a letter to the Spanish authorities saying that, unless the Romanians were willing to ensure that a retrial took place, they should decline Romania&#8217;s request to have him extradited. No such assurance was given, but on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-14">14 May 2007</phrase> he was taken back to Bucharest where he spent a further 21 months in prison, enduring horrendous conditions which fell considerably short of the minimum required by members of the EU. Most importantly, the Spanish constitutional court, following the Foreign Office request, upheld the appeal against extradition&#8212;</p>

	<p pid="b.1258.2/1">Order. These are matters of judgment and degree, and I have been listening carefully to the hon. Gentleman. In the debate on whether the question be not now put, it is perfectly reasonable for Members on either side of the argument to put their case with reference to matters that they think either do or do not require immediate resolution by the House. Where the hon. Gentleman strays somewhat beyond the legitimate parameters of this debate is when he starts to go into great detail, which he is now doing, of the particulars of the matter of the EAW or some other policy matter. That he should not do, and I am clear in my mind, upon receipt of suitable advice, that it would be unwise&#8212;I know the hon.

	<p pid="b.1260.0/1">My right hon. Friend makes an entirely important point. The House might be interested to know that my constituent Andrew Symeou, who languished in jail for 11 months and was not served well by the European arrest warrant, has just tweeted to say that today</p>
	<p pid="b.1260.0/2">&#8220;should be about preventing injustice and protecting British citizens, not be used as a political football!&#8221;</p>

	<p pid="b.1260.1/1">My hon. Friend&#8217;s constituent is entirely right. There are many cases of British citizens, such as Andrew Symeou, Deborah Dark and Colin Dines, being badly mistreated. It is not just British citizens, because the leading criminal lawyers in 11 other countries have complained about this procedure in previous years. It is a very serious issue. This House, above all others, should have been in a position to debate it at some length, rather than being faced with this awful choice between accepting the Government&#8217;s business untouched and forgoing the debate altogether in the fond hope of having it another day.</p>

	<p pid="b.1260.2/1">If we accept the motion proposed by the shadow Home Secretary, we will not forgo the debate; we will be allowed a full debate and the Home Secretary will be able to return with a proper motion on the European arrest warrant. The shadow Home Secretary&#8217;s motion is much to be commended.</p>

	<p pid="b.1260.3/1">I have to say that I disagree with my hon. Friend&#8212;I very rarely do. I would have liked to have had a full-blooded debate with several motions on each component, or at least packages of components of this so-called package, but that was not available to us today, and there is no guarantee that we will get it if the Opposition&#8217;s motion succeeds.</p>

	<p pid="b.1260.4/1">My right hon. Friend is absolutely right that there is no guarantee, should the Opposition&#8217;s motion be carried, that we would get the proper debate that so many people are demanding, but the Government, having behaved pretty shamefully today, will be facing huge embarrassment if they do not give in to the clear will of the House, which is that there should be more time for debate. I urge him to support the shadow Home Secretary.</p>

	<p pid="b.1260.5/1">I am afraid that&#8212;I will explain why in a moment&#8212;I am not in the business of casting something on the waters and hoping that it comes back. If I hear from both Front Benches that they have agreed to meet all day tomorrow to go through this business again, I will change my view, but I will not take a chance with something quite so invidious as this. Let us remember what we are talking about: taking British citizens, with no prima facie evidence, and sending them off to courts elsewhere in Europe. What we have been asked to debate assumes that those courts all deliver equal justice. Romania does not deliver equal justice. Nor does Bulgaria, Greece or Italy. Some of them have post-Soviet justice systems to which we are sending our constituents.</p>
	<p pid="b.1260.5/2">What is so anti-democratic about the Opposition&#8217;s proposal is that it would deny many Members who had intended to speak today the opportunity to do so, and that is a tragedy, because this House&#8217;s first responsibility, as I have said, is the delivery of justice for our constituents. We will not have the opportunity to discuss the alternatives,</p>
	<p pid="b.1260.5/3">such as having a multiple-negotiated outcome, rather than the European arrest warrant. We will not be able to talk about the other implications of Europol and Eurojust for the actions of the European Court and the ability of the Home Secretary to pass laws that protect us. All in all, I think that this is a very unfortunate outcome for Parliament today&#8212;a very clever parliamentary trick, but very poor democracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261.0/1">Does my right hon. Friend agree that it is not only those Members who wished to speak tonight who have been cheated, but those who, like me, wished to listen to the arguments on both sides?</p>

	<p pid="b.1261.1/1">I agree with my hon. Friend. He will hear some of us attempting to stay in order&#8212;desperately, Mr Speaker&#8212;while making those arguments, but he will be unable to vote explicitly on them; he will have to vote on whether we have a vote on another day or we close down the debate today. That is not the way Parliament is designed to work. I am afraid, therefore, that this is a travesty of democracy.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261.2/1">I thank my right hon. Friend for making his comments. Would not the solution be for the Government to make it clear from the Dispatch Box that they will make time available to allow us to discuss the issue properly, as the country wants and as Parliament wants, and then we can move on? It is within their scope to do that now.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261.3/1">It is, of course, within their scope, and I was very tempted at the beginning of the exercise to suggest to the Home Secretary that she shoots the Opposition&#8217;s fox&#8212;that she says, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a day&#8217;s debate tomorrow. There you are. All over.&#8221; They would have looked stupid and we would have looked very democratic. Sadly, that did not happen. I will not vote for the proposal today. I may abstain, I may double-vote, but I am not going to vote for the proposal because I do not want us to leave uncovered an extremely important debate in the history of this House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261.4/1">Last time the previous Question was moved, I voted for it. On this occasion I will vote against it. The difficulty is to work out what the Opposition feel they will achieve from this. Although there is always an argument about the Executive lumping together lots of decision into one vote, one of the more complex questions is when the Executive are bound by a motion of the House. It was obvious on the Wild Animals in Circuses Bill and various other occasions that the Executive are not automatically bound by motions in the House. The Executive are bound when they say they will be bound. On this occasion the Executive have said that they will be bound. There is therefore nothing else on that that the Opposition can achieve and the motion should be withdrawn.</p>

	<p pid="b.1261.5/1">I support the previous Question. To listen to some of the right hon. and hon. Members who have spoken, one would think that the Question destroyed our democracy, that it threatened</p>
	<p pid="b.1261.5/2">our democracy or that it was bad for this debate. Not a bit of it. Of course the substantive Question is a matter of the first importance to justice, security, our international relations, our constitution and the democratic control of power.</p>
	<p pid="b.1261.5/3">In a moment we will have a chance to answer the question, &#8220;Are the Government asking the House the right questions?&#8221; I urge everybody to vote Aye and send the Government back to reformulate the question, come back to the House and ask us the right questions about matters of the most grave importance. The motion&#8212;the previous Question&#8212;is not a motion to destroy our democracy; it is a motion to save it, and I commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="b.1262.0/1">As the previous Question is an unusual procedure, I think I ought to repeat to the House the effect of this motion, because several Members have come up to me, quite understandably in this unusual situation, somewhat uncertain about what is at stake and what the implications of a particular course of action are. Let me try to help.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.0/2">If the previous Question&#8212;that is, the motion put by the shadow Home Secretary at, if memory serves me correctly, 7.1 pm is agreed to&#8212;the draft regulations introduced by the Home Secretary will not be further considered at this sitting. That is to say, they will not be further considered tonight. If the previous Question is negatived&#8212;that is, the right hon. Lady&#8217;s motion is defeated&#8212;the Chair would be required to put the Question on the draft regulations straight away, without any further debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.0/3">Lastly, before I put the Question, I can say to the House, with reference to an inquiry at a very senior level that has just been put to me, that yes, of course, if the House wishes to debate a motion or a set of motions of a similar or a different character, or a combination of similar and different characters, tomorrow, it is perfectly at liberty to do so. I am not saying it should do so; I am not saying any such thing. That is not for the Chair, but the House would be at liberty to do so with an emergency business statement to explain the change of business.</p>
	<p pid="b.1262.0/4">I hope it is clear what the implication of agreeing to the previous Question is&#8212;no further consideration of the draft regulations tonight. If the motion is rejected, the draft regulations would have to be put to the vote without any further debate. And yes, the matters can be treated of by the House tomorrow if colleagues wish to do so. My role is simply to facilitate the will of the House. Is that clear?</p>

Have you had any indication from Government Front Benchers, in the light of the speeches made in all parts of the House today, that they will come forward with a vote tomorrow on the remaining 24 measures?</p>

	<p pid="b.1266.1/1">I am grateful to the right hon. Lady for her point of order. As I indicated in my explanatory statement before this vote, in which I sought to explain to the House the implications of different courses of action, I had been approached about debating some matters tomorrow, and I explained what was possible, but no determination was communicated to me by Government on that matter. In the circumstances, therefore, the proper course is to proceed to the next vote, which flows naturally from the defeat of the first motion. I therefore now need to put the Question on the draft regulations straight away without any further debate.</p>

	<p pid="b.1273.3/1">Tonight, I wish to raise a number of issues regarding the tragic death of my constituent Mr David Efemena.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/2">First, I thank you, Mr Speaker, for the waiver of the sub judice rules regarding Adjournment debates, which is needed because the pre-inquest hearing begins on <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-17">17 November 2014</phrase>. The issues that I will cover do not relate specifically to the findings of the coroner on the reasons for David&#8217;s death, which is why the waiver was granted, and the family very much appreciate that. Rather, I will focus on the events that took place in the camp that night, the camp protocols on the duty of care, and the questions of supervision and effective communication between adults and cadets.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/3">David died at 14 years of age on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-23">23 March 2014</phrase>. He would have celebrated his 15th birthday last Wednesday. By all accounts, he was a strong, sporty, athletic young man. David went on an air cadet camping trip on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-21">Friday 21 March 2014</phrase> at the Bramley defence training estate in Hampshire. On <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-23">Sunday 23 March</phrase>, at about 9 am, his parents Zoe and Felix received a telephone call from Basingstoke hospital advising them that David was &#8220;poorly&#8221;. While they were still speaking to the hospital, the police arrived at their home in Elm Park in east London to take them to the hospital. Upon arrival, a lady detective met the family and said, &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry for your loss.&#8221; That is how they discovered that their son had died.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/4">I will provide a brief summary of the events that occurred on the base over that weekend before making some more specific points regarding David&#8217;s death. The summary is based on an oral report of the initial findings of the investigation that was given to the family on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-27">27 March 2014</phrase>. There are also some elements that come from the service inquiry report.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/5">The training that weekend was to take place at training base A, with the use of areas known as A, B and C. A risk assessment, an emergency action plan and a military training plan were all included in the Bramley application for the weekend. There were 13 male cadets and two female cadets on the trip, together with three staff members. Two of the senior cadets were responsible for the supervision of the cadets at the campsite, leaving 13 cadets taking part in the exercise.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/6">On the first night, Friday night, everyone slept in the building at training base A because the group arrived late. Following a 6 am start, the Saturday was spent setting up camp and practising patrolling, followed by an escape and evasion exercise, with four cadets evading and nine hunting, one of whom was my constituent David Efemena. The staff ordered the cadets to go back</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/7">to their bashers after 10 pm on the Saturday. The staff then went back to training base A, which was 1.9 km from the cadets&#8217; camping sites, according to the service inquiry report. It took members of the service inquiry team about nine minutes to drive between the two sites when subsequently investigating the events of the weekend.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/8">Two-way radios were supplied to each group to retain contact. The last actual contact between staff and the group took place at 10.15 pm, according to an oral report of the initial findings of the investigation that was read out to the family on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-27">27 March 2014</phrase>. The next morning at between 6.20 and 6.30 am, as the staff leader was walking to the cadet site, he began to receive intermittent radio messages, but could not make out what was being said. At 6.45, he received a clearer message that the cadets could not wake David. The staff arrived at the campsite at approximately 7.5 am. On realising the condition that David was in, they called for an ambulance while administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation. They were joined by another ambulance and then an air ambulance and the police.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/9">According to an interview with a fellow cadet and tent mate, David had complained on the Saturday afternoon, <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-22">22 March 2014</phrase>, about an old rugby injury to his back and of feeling sick. Later, a rota for sentry patrols was established for that night, although David was excused given how hard he had worked carrying heavy equipment that day and because there was an odd number of cadets to divide up. However, I should add that it was suggested in the evidence of other cadets that he was relieved of duty because of his sore back.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/10">Sometime after 11 pm, the cadets went to bed. David&#8217;s tent mate has said that he was woken on up to 10 separate occasions through the night by strange noises and shaking from David. Each time he tried gently to shake David to wake him, but at no time did he succeed. At 5 am, David&#8217;s tent mate relieved two others for sentry duty, which began about 4 metres from where David was sleeping. His tent mate says that he then heard what were described as &#8220;wild animal noises&#8221; coming from the direction of the tent and assumed it to be a wild animal. Those sounds were heard another two or three times that morning, and the tent mate, covered by a fellow 14-year-old cadet, went to see David, who by that stage was shaking violently. At about 6.55 am they again went to check on David, and they noticed that his eyes were wide open and realized that they could not wake him up. David&#8217;s tent mate woke the other cadets and was left with David for about 30 minutes until adult staff arrived.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/11">There are slight discrepancies in timings throughout between the statements of the tent mate and the adults, but that is the basic series of events according to the police liaison officer assigned to the case.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/12">On the cause of death, the family had a meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-28">28 March 2014</phrase> with the coroner&#8217;s officer David Richards, who had notified them that the coroner&#8217;s report would be completed after the receipt of reports from both Home Office and paediatric pathologists, the police report and the service inquiry report. During the meeting, David Richards stated that the preliminary medical report showed that David had a scarred indent kidney, fluid in his lungs, an enlarged heart and a swollen brain. Mr Richard discussed with the family the possibility that David&#8217;s heart was enlarged, and that it could have been hereditary and the reason for his death.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/13">On <phrase class="date" code="2014-05-09">9 May</phrase>, the family received a letter from the coroner Andrew Bradley, stating that he could</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/14">&#8220;confirm that Professor Sheppard has completed her examination and I have a natural cause of death for David. In those circumstances I have concluded my Investigation and released David for burial.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/15">Cardiac specialist Mary Sheppard had reported a discovered heart defect and concluded that death was due to natural causes. However, the forensic pathologist had not completed his report at the time, so the family&#8217;s concerns about the circumstances surrounding David&#8217;s death, particularly the lack of adult supervision, communication and early intervention, were not taken into consideration before the case was closed.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/16">The family, my office and solicitors have made a number of requests for the reasons for the delay in completing the pathologist&#8217;s report and how Mr Bradley had come to his conclusion, but they have not been answered. Subsequently, the family had a phone call on <phrase class="date" code="2014-07-03">Wednesday 3 July</phrase>, and then they received a formal letter on <phrase class="date" code="2014-07-04">4 July</phrase> that stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/17">&#8220;Having regards to the history of the case and your concerns it seems appropriate for the matter to go forward to Inquest and for that purpose I have transferred jurisdiction to your local Coroner in Walthamstow.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/18">As you said, Mr Speaker, there are a number of questions to be answered about the process that cannot be covered here tonight. Instead, I want to raise a number of points relating to the events on the base that weekend. Following David&#8217;s death, the family were assigned a police liaison officer from the Hampshire major investigation team and a warrant officer from RAF Northolt. On <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-24">24 March 2014</phrase>, the family presented the police liaison officer with a list of questions that needed answers regarding events at the camp on that Saturday night and Sunday morning. In an e-mail dated <phrase class="date" code="2014-04-02">2 April 2014</phrase>, the police liaison officer said that</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/19">&#8220;these questions will be fully answered in time as all the information regarding the case is gathered together.&#8221;</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/20">The parents notified both the police and the RAF that they would carry out an independent examination, and the independent examination report was presented to the family last <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-06">Thursday, 6 November 2014</phrase>. The service inquiry report, with three A4 ring binders of reference documents, was handed to them last <phrase class="date" code="2014-11-09">Saturday, 9 November</phrase>, by the president of the board of the service inquiry team, Squadron Leader Paul Ellis, and Warrant Officer Duncan Andrews. Therefore, until last Saturday, the family&#8217;s only account of what had happened to their son had been provided on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-27">27 March 2014</phrase>&#8212;some seven and a half months earlier&#8212;when the police liaison officer and the RAF warrant officer verbally explained their initial findings surrounding the events of that night.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/21">Despite the service inquiry report with three A4 ring binders of reference documents, many of the initial questions submitted by the family in late March 2014 remain unanswered. Those concerns cover three general areas, the first of which is the time taken to alert the adult in charge as to David&#8217;s condition that night, and therefore the medical attention given to David. The second is the protocols on the base regarding the supervision of cadets, and third is the possibility that the camp communication systems were faulty. The family believe that those factors might have made a difference to David&#8217;s survival that night, which is why I am asking these questions this evening.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/22">Having read the completed service inquiry report, the following areas still need to be resolved. On the diagnosis of David&#8217;s condition and communication on the base that weekend, the following questions need to be answered: when David initially declared that he was unwell, how was that managed and monitored, and by whom? It would appear that the adult in charge did not have the next of kin information. The parents were informed of David being &#8220;unwell&#8221; from Basingstoke hospital, and did not receive any communication from the RAF. As I mentioned earlier, they were informed that David had passed away by the hospital on arrival in Basingstoke, but prior to that there had been no contact between the RAF and the family.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/23">What are the protocols for determining a suitable camping area, or on the distance between adult supervisors and cadets? What are the emergency protocols in such environments? In this case, the service inquiry report details the distance from the camp site where the cadets were based to training base A where the adults were as some 1.9 km&#8212;approximately a nine-minute drive. According to the service inquiry report, the original camp area that was planned to be used that weekend had been changed, and an alternative camp area had to be used due to the cadets&#8217; late arrival on the base on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-21">Friday 21 March 2014</phrase>. The service inquiry report highlights that no risk assessments or other checks were carried out on the alternative site prior to its use.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/24">From the time that David was first believed to be shivering at about midnight, causing initial concern in his fellow cadet, were the first aiders made aware of his condition? What &#8220;escalation process&#8221; was in operation that night for cadets if they had concerns about their tent mates? As I have mentioned, David&#8217;s tent mate had concerns throughout the night and attempted to wake him on approximately 10 separate occasions. The parents were not informed of David&#8217;s condition before the police attended the scene, so why was that the case? Overall, from about midnight until around 5 am on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-23">23 March 2014</phrase>, David had shown symptoms giving rise for concern. Would earlier medical intervention have given him an opportunity to survive if an adult, and not a fellow 14-year-old cadet, had assessed his situation?</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/25">The second area of concern relates to supervision on such training camps. Are parents aware when their children go on training trips that they are being cared for by 17-year-old senior cadets and not necessarily by adults? Should parents be made aware that there is not 100% adult supervision at all times, prior to signing the &#8220;Activities, Consent and Health Form&#8221;? If adults are not within close proximity to the cadets at the camp site, what protections should ensure communication between the sites in the event of illness and escalating health concerns? Should camp protocols ensure that &#8220;experienced&#8221; and not just &#8220;qualified&#8221; first aiders are available at the camp site. The three senior cadets in charge had received &#8220;Heart Start&#8221; first aid training, but did not know what to do when David&#8217;s situation was assessed&#8212;that point is made in the service inquiry report.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/26">Did any of the adults know that David had been unwell prior to leaving the camp that Saturday night, and were any plans in place to monitor his health? Why did the cadets not contact an adult on <phrase class="date" code="2014-03-22">22 March 2014</phrase> from about midnight, when there was first cause for concern? The report suggests a &#8220;lack of process&#8221; or &#8220;non-compliance</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/27">of process&#8221;. Is that because of the lack of effective camp protocols in terms of supervision and medical diagnosis and care?</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/28">The third area relates to equipment. The preliminary report from the police investigation highlighted that the communication system was not working and that it took one of the cadets approximately 30 minutes to alert one of the adults, who were not at the camp area with the cadets. Were the communication devices tested, once the camp site had been determined, based on range? The service inquiry report details that the distance was 1.9 km. We know that six radios were issued for the camping exercise. In May 2014, three of the six radios were tested. Of the three radios that were tested, they had a range shortage of approximately 200 metres between the cadets&#8217; camp site and where the adults resided that night. It is unclear whether the two handsets issued to the cadets were among the three that were tested. The service inquiry report classified the three tested radios as &#8220;unserviceable&#8221;. It is unclear whether the handsets issued to the cadets had a fault range of greater than 200 metres. That raises questions regarding emergency procedures and the effectiveness of communications devices on the base that night. That is obviously of vital importance if cadets are miles away from their adult supervisors.</p>
	<p pid="b.1273.3/29">These questions need to be answered. It has been nearly eight months since the death of my constituent David Efemena. Throughout, the family have battled to find out what happened to their beloved son that night. Answers to those questions, and many others concerning other elements of the case, are needed so that we might be reassured that our young people are safe when attending weekend military camping trips. If protocols on our military bases need to change, the family would take some comfort that other families might not have to experience what they have had to experience in the past seven and a half months following the tragic death of their son David Efemena.</p>

	<p pid="b.1277.0/1">I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" id="uk.org.publicwhip/member/40195" name="Jon Cruddas">the hon. Member for Dagenham and Rainham (Jon Cruddas)</phrase> on securing this debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/2">I express my sympathy and offer my condolences to the family and to everyone who knew and loved David Efemena. Those of us who are parents cannot think of anything worse than the death of a child. Burying a child is every parent&#8217;s nightmare, but one does not need to be a parent to know and understand that. Our sympathies go out to his family. In these circumstances, it is undoubtedly the case that the awful grief they must bear is made all the worse when they do not know everything that has happened. It is a terrible feature of such cases, but I fear that it is almost inevitable that, to ensure we know everything that happened and are therefore able to learn the lessons, statements need to be taken and post mortems conducted, and pathologists, doctors and other experts all need to make their inquiries. Inevitably, that takes time. It behoves those who are charged with those dreadful tasks to act as swiftly as possible. That has to be in everybody&#8217;s interests, but most importantly it is in the interests of the family who are suffering in grief.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/3">I am placed at a severe disadvantage. I gently chide the hon. Gentleman in this respect: if I may say so, I think he has pre-empted the coroner&#8217;s inquest. This is a</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/4">very serious matter. The death of a cadet is taken extremely seriously, not only by the air cadet organisation in this particular instance but by everybody and anybody associated with such a matter, as one might expect. What then happens is that there is a service inquiry, which delivers its report. I do not know whether the hon. Gentleman has seen the report. I certainly have not, but I make no complaint about that because the service inquiry report was only delivered to the family on Saturday, when two members of the RAF, including the family liaison officer, attended them. That must be the right way. The first people to find out what the service inquiry has looked at and found must be the family, and that is why two members of the RAF attended. The coroner has not received the report yet, so I make no complaint that I have not. It would be a grave discourtesy to the coroner were I to see it before her.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/5">The coroner&#8217;s inquest will be rigorous, transparent and honest. I would like to draw on my own experience as a Member of Parliament. I do not know whether you were in the Chair, Mr Speaker, but not long after my election I secured a debate about a constituent killed by his grandson. It was a terrible case&#8212;I will not trouble anybody with the details because we are talking about David Efemena&#8217;s death&#8212;and in due course there was a coroner&#8217;s inquest, some of which I attended, which lasted longer than the two days currently set aside for the inquest into David&#8217;s death.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/6">It is not just the Nottinghamshire coroner; all coroners conduct extremely good investigations into all matters leading up to a death, as well as the cause of death, and they do so with rigour, honesty and transparency. In what I realise are dreadful circumstances, I know that the hon. Gentleman will take that assurance to the family, whom I know are legally represented, which is important. To be blunt, I hope they have had the benefit of legal aid. If not, I will do everything to ensure that they do. Furthermore, they should know that the coroner will bend over backwards to get all the answers. The family will be at the heart of the investigation.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/7">The hon. Gentleman quite properly asked a series of questions on behalf of the family, not only about the events leading up to David&#8217;s death but about the events after he died. Normally, a coroner cannot look into the latter, but regardless of whether the hon. Gentleman brings this back to the Chamber, I give a solemn promise that I shall ensure as far as possible that all these incredibly important questions are answered. Even if nothing and no one could have saved David, because of some inherent heart problem or condition or whatever it may be, I am told that the service inquiry has nevertheless made more than 20 recommendations arising from the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s important questions about supervision.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/8">It is the nature of these exercises&#8212;be it the Duke of Edinburgh Awards or the cadets&#8212;that they contain an element of excitement and risk. Nevertheless, everything must be done to ensure that children are as safe as possible, and important questions have been raised about the distance between where the youngsters were camping and the adult volunteers. I do not know the recommendations of the service inquiry&#8212;possibly some of that has already been addressed&#8212;but certainly the coroner will look into it. On the way the family were informed, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, I do</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/9">not know if there is ever a good way to deliver such dreadful news, but he asks an important question that needs to be answered.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/10">I do not think there is anything else to add until the coroner has conducted her inquiry and we know her findings, at which point I will be more than happy to answer all these questions as fully as possible.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/11">In this particular case, David&#8217;s family will, of course, always grieve for the loss they suffered because they no longer have their beloved son, but we must remember that other youngsters were involved&#8212;not just the youngster in the tent, but another young man who came to assist&#8212;and, indeed, the adult volunteers who came when they</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/12">were told what had happened. The other young cadets must have suffered a terrible experience to know that somebody in their tent, one of their number, had become so terribly ill and died. Their welfare is also in my mind.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/13">I am more than happy to take any interventions from the hon. Gentleman if he wishes me to assist him further. Mr Speaker, I think that everybody here would join him in expressing our condolences and sympathy to the Efemena family. We hope that all their questions can be answered and that, in time, perhaps some peace could settle upon them.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/14" class="italic">Question put and agreed to.</p>
	<p pid="b.1277.0/15" class="italic">House adjourned.</p>
